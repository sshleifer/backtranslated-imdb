There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary" I found by shouting on television. Bart Sibrel could produce a flasky DVD, but unfortunately he lacks the science behind his claims. He either relies on being inaccurate, not by telling the complete story, or in his old favorite "government always deceives us", and people believe in what they are told and without checking the accuracy or detail behind the claims. Moreover, its "exclusive" or "unlisted" materials are available free of charge on the internet from different sites. <br /> <br /> Reading about the circumstances surrounding this production shows that he used false claims to get interviews and used creative editing of responses to promote his own views. All the statements made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "mistakes" or "whistle" in the Apollo program have been deepened Lipsit. <br /> <br /> How do I get 40 minutes of my life?
