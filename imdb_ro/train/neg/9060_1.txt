Channel surfing and captured this on LOGO. It was one of those moments "I have to look at it because it's so terribly sorry", like Roadhouse without joy. The writing is atrocious; Completely inanimate and acting is bad-in-your-mouth bad. There is a low budget and then there is the abyss where this epic should be thrown and never seen again. I mean, the main characters are going to a skiing session in a rented house, and the house is usually a habit, but they choose to show all the houses that are rolling over it, like the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but I forget that 6 guys look in every 10'x10 'dull room with a futon in it and gushing is blades. I think they did not learn anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the hotel room check scene) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy everything above, so anything goes routine. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. Avoid the plague. Edit: Apparently, other closest reviewers think that since I did not like this movie, I'm a "obvious hater" I can only assume I'm a phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this crazy and crazy and judge the film based on the real content of the film and not just its presence (ie, refreshing to see ...) Sure, it can be refreshing to see but not equate In a great movie, I only give them a better material to work with a tighter direction. In fact, applaud the effort. Honestly, I'd rather go to the "The Kitchen of Distins" catalog than to see this again.
