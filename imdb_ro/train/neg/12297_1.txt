Witchy Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in an isolated hotel and sorts them one by one in a mischievous, disgusting way. I thought I saw everything until an unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his fire. Hildy is also full of prankster: she takes a cockroach and plucks her with her closed mouth ... then she blocks her head down in the chimney, in time for a roaring fire! "Witchery" made me die. He hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by other competent people ... to the final. I have to admit I loved the end. It's a boy and toy-toy recorder surrounded by Linda Blair showing fantastic possessed. The scene takes only about a minute and the movie ends, but you know the old saying, "If you have a wonderful end, people will forgive you for almost anything!"
