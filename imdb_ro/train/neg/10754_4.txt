While waiting to enter the theater with tickets in my hand, I expected an exciting science-fiction film that could feed my appetite for robot technology instead of being disappointed with every aspect of it, proving once again, that the amazing effects can not help a boring plot, which, in my opinion, was worse this year. Also, in the role of this movie I was dissatisfied, Will Smith did not show anything new in this film, yet I have not seen my act of changing since "Men In Black", which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retreat without his name titles such as "Me, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
