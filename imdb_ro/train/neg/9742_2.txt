This is a pretty boring film about a scientist who creates a teleporting device and gets terribly distraught when using the car to carry. Simple plot done before in the fly and others. Not only does he become disfigured, but he can also electrocute people with a touch. What is really stupid about this movie is that we're supposed to think that the place this guy is working on is against him. Perhaps he could make millions for the institution he works for, but the head of the institution is trying to sabotage his teleporter at every step. Eventually, the projected man electrocules three people for no reason, then goes after those who wronged him.
