Absolutely the most boring movie we've ever spent on money. It was a wrong choice for all these big stars to lose their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less inspiring way. There was no actor's talent - just reading a part. Alec can normally play realistic characters, Gwynyth looked ugly for an ungrateful part, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies he chooses to play, just like all those big stars that have left me disappointed the way they allowed all talents to suffocate in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" causes the public to anticipate a great action in a movie that suggests that they are facing deep tension and excitement. There was no time when the distribution was able to show any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ... anyway.
