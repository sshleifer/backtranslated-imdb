I have been an environmentalist for years and I really look forward to this show. I made him record all the episodes, because I thought I could really learn some new things. Perhaps I could go over Rachelle. I'm sure many of them are organized to look like a real show and to attract that class of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle. Since Ed is such a great font, perhaps a second serious environmental performance would be a good idea. There is no need for dental things for some of us. <br /> <br /> I do not record more episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a real green show might be in the factory.
