Well, everything was said about this movie and I hate it when we write reviews where everyone else has already said what is going to be said. But the thing is, I've seen a dozen movies and I'm working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. So I have to write something. The act is stupid. It's really bad how the news anchor expresses its sadness to the collapse of the plane. The monk is beautiful and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the baby. the three main assassinations in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how bad the producers of this film are. They do not realize that even rip-offs can still be frightening. We do not see how the granpa is killed. Your dentist and assistant have made me feel that she deserves to die, you just do not sympathize with them. And the uncle Tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been better worked. I just heard him shout and see nothing!
