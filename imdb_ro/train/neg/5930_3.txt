Hey, if you want to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to do it with Leonard Cohen! This is full of Leonard enough to eat the viewer, who will be left to wonder why all the other singers (some of them are talking) are talking about themselves. Puleeze ... sounds like they're resuming junior journal entries - who cares about you, Leonard? Guess what people are, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone is going to do a documentary about you. I have especially discovered the insulting of U2 members' parade as if this add credibility to this movie - NO. Leonard does not need Bono or Edge to talk about his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for directors to embody a part of his spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept! I will give Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker's props for their Cohen songs - the rest of the shows were boring and some were unbearable. Cohen's fans, do not say I did not warn you!
