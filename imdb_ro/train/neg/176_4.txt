<br /> <br /> I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It came right after the first. For some reason, this movie made me interested. I do not know why, do not ask. SPOILS --- Good ... It was camouflaged how this guy was involved in making the film. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequence, half of killing / killing attempts were normally without any reason. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, captured the co-writer because of creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to destroy the cast? No movies are distributed. He wanted to "look real when they died"? If it was supposed to be a movie with such a big budget, use the special effects, MAN. Of course, first, the captured little girl moves away, and Stanley ends up confused and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This potential HAD film. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I would look at a "Cabin by Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson and he is the only one who has a good part in this sequence.
