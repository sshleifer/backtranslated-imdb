First of all, when I saw the trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel, would martial arts and I was fine with that ... until I saw the movie. The action was badly made, the movie could not be told to anyone, the battles were unrealistic and they blew ... along with the plot. If you think it's a Buffy Vampire Slayer sorcerer, a girl who is descended from other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her call and wants to become the queen return, the supervisor who makes her prepare for a great fight against an ancient evil. The idea was not all original, the film wasted time.
