A different look at horror. The differences in style between American and Russian films are interesting. Still, from my American perspective, this movie was not that good. The protagonist, Marie, played by Anastasia Hille, was not a nice character and I had difficulty identifying with her. It was most of the disagreeable and confusing time for much of the remaining time. Also, too much time has been spent to bring them to the mainstream of the movie. Then it was a long time before any real suspense developed. Once it happened, it seemed that the volume was used as the main effect that was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and did not use sex to compensate for a slim plot. Generally, I would recommend it for rent, but not for theaters.
