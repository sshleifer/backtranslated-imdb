I will not add to plot reviews, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> A very unlikely orphanage on Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br /> Some beautiful landscapes. Good for spotting the girl, and I quote, "Look at the mouth, which is Cassie from fools and horses." Otherwise, a poor example of the British cinema industry. Fulton MacKay was much better in Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better in everything else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> He was free to look at the horror channel before switching to the subscription. I will not subscribe to this effort.
