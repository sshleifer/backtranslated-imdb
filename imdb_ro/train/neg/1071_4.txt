A very poor film, mainly due to a bad story, but also a bad act in the case of Robert Downey Jr., and the irrational behavior of many characters. If you are someone who likes to stop your mind and just watch a movie because it's creativity or action criteria then you may like this movie. Personally, I can not do this with a drama and I found this too much. I especially get angry when a main character, who should be a smart person, behaves like a complete imbecile. In this movie, if the main character acted as a person would normally act in these situations, there would be no movie. The first thing most unlikely is when the main character, a successful lawyer named Magruder, played by Kenneth Branagh, leaves from a party and happens to a girl, Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz, who screams that her car has was stolen. They are standing around a tropical storm, while polishing it to accept a trip home. She tells her her strange father who belongs to a weird sect and does crazy things. When they get to her dilapidated boat on the poorer side of the city, they notice her car is on the way. Also, the house lights are lit and some items in the house are broken. Things are strange but strange (look like a tramp, get dressed in front of him until it's completely empty? Yes!). Also, the strange father, the house is a wreck - everything should have told Magruder: "Hey, that's too strange for me, I'm out of here!" But not Magruder, he sleeps with her, and then, motivated by her story and sex, deals with the attempt to hired her father. - the lawyer who is, arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt she had one night before (a fact that all the women in the note from the office). A successful lawyer is likely to behave like a 16-year-old, Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases, so when he goes to the police, arguing with ample evidence that his father is terrorizing him, the police ignore him. at all - it is not possible! It's simply unlikely.
