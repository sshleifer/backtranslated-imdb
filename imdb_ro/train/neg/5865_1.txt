I can not say enough bad things about the wreck. It's one of the few movies I've been tempted to go. It was a bad premise to start with the first pregnant man but then try to make him a doll. What were spoofing all those real pregnant males ??? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes, he would be at the bottom of IMDB 100. If I could give him a zero, I might think I would have given him too much credit.
