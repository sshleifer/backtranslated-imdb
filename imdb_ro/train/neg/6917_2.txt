Again, the same familiar story about a man (the writer here) who sells the soul of the devil to have the most desired ambition in life: success. Invalid scenario (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines to understand the "strong" Christmanish message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) scene at the end of which Agent Hopkins beats the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not sexy or bad at all) for all the bad things he has done for this character that can not be found. No bad efforts from the actors (Baldwin also as director, Cattrall in a role "Sex and the City" again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try a Greek movie called "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives the devil's soul to regain his youth)
