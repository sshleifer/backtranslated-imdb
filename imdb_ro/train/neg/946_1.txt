Why is this show so popular? Beyond me, why do I like people? I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried several times to watch it and can not do it through a whole episode. horrible. Everyone overlaps to the point where it's annoying to look. I speak in unnatural voices, use uninteresting tones and have natural body language. I saw a better action in a kindergarten school. <br /> <br /> For another thing, it's not FUNNY. Plots are boring. They are not creative, intelligent, or FUNNI. Should not a sitcom be funny? Why do not I laugh? Finally, what is seventy years old? It's about as authentic in the seventies as "Happy Days" was in the 50's. Oh, and what's going on with Ashton Kutcher? Who threw this dweeb? And now he makes movies? Save us all! If people think it's quality TV, I'm worried.
