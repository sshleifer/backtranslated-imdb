This is a 30-minute show about a joke. Joke, Cavemen are not treated properly. HaHaHa !!! He can not dial a phone because he's a Cave man. Cavemen are not as intelligent as human beings. People in the Cave are so simple. There is no humor in this show. They can only run away from this joke for so long and already have Geico ads. This show does not deserve a time slot on the national TV. This show tries to be difficult to be fun, but it's simply not. Looking at this show, I thought it was trying to be like a "wild show of Bachelor." It means I go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying cave is annoying. Caveman with glasses is too smart to be a caveat man (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not figure out why I do not care about them.
