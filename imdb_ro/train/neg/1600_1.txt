The biggest national hit Lampoon remains "Animal House", and rightly so. He was funny, hoarse and well-born. The exact opposite of every other Lampoon national film. Including "Classroom Reunion". PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or because John Hughes wrote this miserable misery. This reunion is as hilarious as the root canal and twice as painful. A star, and that's generous. Then, always, I always thought that most of my old colleagues were demons, vampires, and serial killers.
