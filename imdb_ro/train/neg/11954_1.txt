This movie was terrible. Throughout the movie, I was puzzled and I did not see any point. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was all about. This movie is not worth watching at all. Not only is he sick and revolting, but totally STUPID! Do not forget if you are not one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film casts doubt on Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then it is a country that I would not want to visit or bother to know about it. This is a completely sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not like it because it did not make sense. My friend and I stood there waiting to see if there was a horror, because it was listed. It was a total disappointment.
