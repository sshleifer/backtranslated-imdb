This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw her at the premiere at SXSW and she was extremely disappointed. The director did not know much about John Lennon and even said how much to the premiere. This is a drama, but people laughed along to the way the cheese was the movie it was. This is never a good sign. The only rescue graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates / colleagues. They were fun, while the rest of the movie was too serious. The cheese abandonment of the Beatles was just absurd. The soundtrack was excellent and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of those crazy fans, crazy Dominic Monaghan, do not bother with this.
