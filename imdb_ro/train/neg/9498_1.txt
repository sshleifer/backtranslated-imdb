When I'm looking for new cars, I do not want to show him the boats. When I drink Coca-Cola, I should expect the drink to contain Coca-Cola. When I look at a movie that beautifies the name of an excellent scientist, I expect it to be relevant to that person or her work. People might be talking about my diary diary. The covered material is relevant only because they know vaguely. I fell asleep the first time I tried to look at her, and the second time I stopped looking at her. I like science and documentaries. I'd rather watch them over the last blockbuster. However, this falls far short of offering something worth the time? Avoid at all costs.
