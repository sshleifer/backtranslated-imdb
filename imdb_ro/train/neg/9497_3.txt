you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old when filming, but he looked at nearly 70 years and lived only eight years. At one point Holden said, "I'm over twice." Okay, try a triple grandfather! The oldest issue for which they were shot did not work. Older elderly citizens sometimes come with legal teenagers. More power for them, but that does not mean I want to see him. It's not a matter of judgment, it's a digestive trail. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to look at, and cars in the 70's, clothes, furniture, and so on. it deserves to be worth it if it comes late at night and you want to see something cool in bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde girlfriend, who beat her guitar, got more scenes. Pleasant space ... Who was this guy? I'll try to find out.
