If I had not been forced to follow her for work reasons, I would never have crossed the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit that I quickly sent parts. The movie version of '63 was extremely superior in all respects. Yes, I read that this is more faithful to the original piece, but what was the wise thing for the writer to change the script in '63! It's long, it pulls, the songs that are in this version and not in the movie version are boring and non-imaginative. The "Kids" version in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of humorous sarcastic parent. In this version Kim is too old, Conrad is absolutely horrible * to see (when someone broke his shirt from him I closed with disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (it can not even remain in the tone) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like that, his career would have ended before he started. As for the other actors, I was waiting for Alexander's dander to fall as she danced, and Daly was completely a mother. See Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the same role performed by someone who understands the synchronization of comedies. This TV version is nothing but a total loss of time for anyone.
