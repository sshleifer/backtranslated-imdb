I forgot this movie. The subject should have resulted in a very beautiful film, and the actor was certainly sensitive and talented to deal with the subject, but the script - if there's even a script - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slide show that does not go anywhere. I would say it will not go anywhere quickly, except that it is the longest 81-minute period you'll ever do. As mentioned, the main actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), Like his sometimes tough but ultimately loving and accepting mother. Movie makers have many answers because here's a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically a way out of a movie that has never been done. Go over it - it's not worth the $ 6 I've paid for pay-per-view.
