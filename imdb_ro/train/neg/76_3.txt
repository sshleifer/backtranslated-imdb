I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne. It's superficial, two-dimensional, unaffected, and hard to believe, given the subject, boring. The actors are acceptable, but they did not have much to do, considering the very frustrating and non-impressive scenario. For those who may have been concerned that Ned Kelly has been too much intellectual, you can feel comfortable in the fact that this narrative story is completely devoid of any literal depth, fully spoken and full of central standards hijack. However, it does not even work as a popcorn movie. His pacing is too embarrassed and his craft is too unsatisfactory even at the level of a mundane operator. I doubt very much that Gregor Jordan could stand back and say "this is the best I could have done with the material." Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and so is the national response to him. Probably a popular genius, possibly class warrior, possibly a psychopath, and probably all of these things, he has dominated the true Australian mythology for over 120 years. Once again, his story failed miserably on the big screen. That's how life is.
