... this verse does not swallow Bard the evil one. It is still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is inexplicably named by a Spanish (whether it is Ricardo Montalban or not debated), and Maximilian Schell is upset like never before. Most of the dialogue makes it unharmed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels compelled to emphasize repeatedly that the speeches are long does not seem incredibly humorous to me. In large part, however, it is just a bad action.
