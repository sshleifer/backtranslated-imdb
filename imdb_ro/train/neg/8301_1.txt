Really bad. Why someone thinks it's a good movie, let alone funny, is a real mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I loved "a Christmas story". The fact that he had the same director and was based on the memoirs of the same writer made me completely puzzled why this film is a complete failure at all levels. Charles Grodin is miserable as a father for the start. For another it does not seem to have the same pacing - it simply does not work well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that has penetrated the first film is completely absent here - you just want the movie to end. I would not recommend this movie to the curiosity seekers who enjoyed a Christmas story. It's so bad. 1/10.
