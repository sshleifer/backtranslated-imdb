What begins like a pretty smart farce on a shadowy security monitoring company almost instantly turns into a dishonest and completely intimate mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying hard to make this trained work train, but some things are not feasible from a human point of view. For example, what makes Gale suddenly turn from a sweet mother figure into drunk beater at Tommy's parents' house? Why would Heinrich want, though, of course, a boring man, to destroy the business he dedicates his life to, by plundering and eventually killing his clients? Why does Tommy apparently think Heinrich might be a killer (based almost entirely on a dream) and even if he is credible, why would not he go to the police? And why did Gale not activate the alarm when he got home, especially after they argued Howie about being stopped? Of course, all these events are required for the plot (and I use the very, very poor term) to take place. And it could be forgiven if even the smallest comedy came out. But everything, from Howie's description of his rape to Dr. Gale's erroneous identification, to the last "joke" about Gale and Howie, which is still dead, is tastier and more pathetic than anything else. checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers," but there is nothing else that I or anyone else could do to ruin that which already gives rise to the high sky.
