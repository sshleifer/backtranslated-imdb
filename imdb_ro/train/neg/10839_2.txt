This was featured on the biography channel and was as informative as a comic of children! I gave her 2 out of 10 for the attention paid to the details, because she mostly had a sensation of 70 years, and the three ladies who played the three original angels showed that they, so makeup- it was good. <br /> <This should have been a biography on the biography channel, but it was devoid of everything that is customary / seen in one of their biographies. There are no interviews with surviving members, crew members, production team members, etc. or friends, families, and biographies of those people. In fact, I know as much about the program as before looking at this biographic (assumed) biographic film. In terms of learning what no one knew about the program, it was not a common knowledge that never happened.
