... look at poor character Robert Webber (a great performance, once again!) who is trying to fight a machine gun from a terrorist. Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm stance in the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and much more fantastic, ironic and, therefore, never-ending Die Hard). The story comes as an unsuccessful attempt to glorify SAS commands. Ideas that when a commander calls out "going" all the good boys do this and all the bad guys do not do so they can destroy ad lib (with good conscience) that the main character is not cut off by gas masked commands, though wearing the same clothes and wearing a weapon from their arsenal seems unlikely and makes it hard to take the film seriously. And it just happens to be more than fun. mirror-to-episode episode ... I do not mind the criticism of the Pacifist movement as a shield for the villains and the arguments between the fanatics of peace and the settlers, even led by the representatives of power in this film, but the political commentary is rather lame and uninspired . This is unfortunate because the film presents an early performance of Judy Davies, who plays the main fanaticism and seems to have done a thorough study of the subject. "However, her performance is superior to that of others and, in a sense, I feel the movie leaves her down.
