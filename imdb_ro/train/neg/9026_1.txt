This must be the worst direction I have seen. Clarity can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene has nothing but a close film, it loses its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has a very beautiful landscape to work with, the background of Mexico, the canteens, the beautiful place where Anthony Quinn lives, and Costner dust cities go on his revenge journey. Unfortunately, we just take a quick look at these places before the camera cuts a large giant head image. Even the transition scenes, in which Costner leads alone in Mexico, cut off quickly. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been treated much better. Among other things, too many people are coming from nowhere to help Costner over time - it's just a bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical thriller story, but many others have taken the same premise and have done remarkable things with it. Costner's No Way Out costume had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better film. <br /> <br /> The end was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the most melodramatic scores of the film. This movie will never be great, but if we see more about Mexico and fewer huge heads, this movie could have been tracked.
