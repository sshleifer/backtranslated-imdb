Williamson's focus is hard to pass. He speaks incredibly fast, as if he is rushing through the lines. During soliloquies he behaves as if he were talking to someone, when he should talk to himself. All this and his chelady thing got me upset. He was too old for this role. Read other accounts of Williamson, maybe he got this role because he was crazy, and the director decided to make a bit of life - an imitation art or a forced method of acting. When the actors say Hamlet is crazy that you believe her! Marianne Faithful is an amazing beauty and could escape the role of Ophelia and get another pass. The set is dark and pretended, but it looks as if shot in a real castle, especially scenes in tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines like a great light in the sky.
