When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking for her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes." The closer it gets to the truth, the more it becomes a threat to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of the local satanists. They will do all that is necessary to put an end to its terrible roads. If you are in Satanic themed, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is full of a lot of nudity and soft core ritualistic sex. A scene involving especially a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the messes in the world can not save the black candles. Most of the film is a complete piece. Apart from the scenario I have already mentioned, many sexual scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. The actor is the best. Even your favorite Helga Line offers disappointing performance. Plot does not matter at all. Its main function seems to be to keep the string of boring sexual scenes together. I'm only familiar with another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his daughters of darkness, combining eroticism and horror, Black Lanterns becomes amateur. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
