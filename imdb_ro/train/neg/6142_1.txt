Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad kind of bad movies. It's so terrible that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas obviously does not have a profitable career in acting. He should go back to gymnastics. But who can forget memorable scenes such as the tall chalk bar, the stone horse, or the five-minute sled track through the slow moving village of madmen. I do not think it was supposed to be so bad, but who can say it. It's not art, but if you want something barking and fluffy to make a good conversation, rent the gimakta. It's for a night of fun.
