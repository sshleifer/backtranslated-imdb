Normally, I would not write an online comment, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed just like a series of soaps ("The Young and the Anxious" is really filmed by professionals compared to it), but it also has terrible cuts. There is no action. It is full of unnecessary rubbish. Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character when he's fired for him. So, after loads of nonsense, here they are: the guy puts a knife on his throat and says something like, "You're dead now." Then the main character says, "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police that it threatened me." So the guy (killer) goes (to cry): "Oh no ... the policemen are following me ... Oh ... My God." Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe this movie exists. So if you want to see the movie ever again ... continue it, I recommend it :)
