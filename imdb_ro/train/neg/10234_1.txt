I will keep this short; thanks to Greg for helping me say this succinctly: Captivity is about a guy who drinks a girl's drink, loads her and crushes her, then makes her captive to have sex with her. This is the only twist and punchline of the movie. This is torture as the rape of the movement. Nor is it a good movie. It's not so bad that it's good; it's bad. It should also be noted that among the critics there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even if some were tempted to do so because it is so bad. Why did not Cojones need to climb and say, "this is garbage and for this reason" is beyond me. Do not give money for these brochures.
