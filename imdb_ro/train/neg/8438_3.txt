I suppose bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy, but only now. It's sad that Fox movies are the ones that get a big release on DVD, exposing people who are not very familiar with L & H with MULTI stuff, rather than with their classic comedies. Once again, boys are mocking with a romantic plot about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the boss's daughter, who hates him and prefers a slick type. It's incredible to believe that the Fox geniuses thought it was what L & H needs in their movies. Without their pancake makeup, the boys seem tired and elderly. The only scenes he's working on in this image are when he tries to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the pretty bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum, being a bad noir classic, tries to sell it to Oliver Hardy "insurance" on Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Look at this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Desert Sons".
