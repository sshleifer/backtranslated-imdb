54 is a movie about a club with the same title in the 1970s. Has the good classic bartender. Sexy women. Strong owner. Pause. When everything gets together, the chaos appears, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be in the hands of everything. <br /> <br /> I will be as pure and honest as possible, avoiding any unjust or untrue comments (such as "Ok"). It really seems to me a complete movie full of compliments of his plot. Every time I look at a movie that plays Salma Hayek, I always look forward to seeing her beauty, expressing at the same time radiant performance, but the reality reminds me invariably how great it is . I mean, really, what left her with the masses, except for her huge dinner dancing in 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ...? The same is true of Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who does not offer anything on the screen, but his good looks and crazy fa√ßade, otherwise known as "action." Mike Myers is not as bad as these 2, he gives something at least to the Film. He plays the eccentric, extrovert co-founder of the 54th club. The guy that most of them would hate (a well-done job), he does somewhat convincing performance that I enjoyed rarely from filming. But, unfortunately, it is not enough to save the film from the naked and smooth. The worst bad movies find something in the movie, but that has nothing in reality. Neve Campbell is not too bad, but she's just "there." The story is boring, it seems that the writer bent more on making a film of this style and beauty and forgot to add something else. Whatever you understand. Any class. Anything else. Because, like most ornaments, they are just bare objects, which are not at all interesting, which are pretty beautiful to look, very similar to the base of this disastrous film. Truly an hour and a half I could have spent doing something more exciting, such as talking to 90-year-old relatives on the phone about weather.
