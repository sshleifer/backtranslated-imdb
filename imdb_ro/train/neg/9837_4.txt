The beginning of John Wayne Lone Star Western has a little more for him than those Wayne did for Lone Star up to that point. For one, he has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor than a standard character, Lone Star, brings more professionalism to the environment, instead of the usual readings of lines often delivered to these places. Behavior, mistaken identity, payroll and murder are as cute and superficial as you would expect to be in a low-budget jacket in the 1930s, but Wayne's good looks, the charm and the road with a line going very far to make it more enjoyable. Great, Eddy Chandler's balding is not quite credible as Wayne's "female partner", and there's a gag running about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are on the verge of entering a fight fights that grow tiring. On the other hand, Wayne's love interest is played by no one other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the famous "Little Rascals." She is 20 years old, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's ladies in these Lone Star / Monogram "B" coins were pretty gentle and colorless, but Mary is perceptible, cute and, yes, sexy. There is a scene in the general store where he works, where Wayne asks him to bring him a bottle of "nervous tonic" that happens to be on the top shelf so he has to get on a ladder and climb up shelf. Wayne mirrors a small part of his back as he climbs up the stairs, then as he descends, then again a few minutes later when he asks to go up and bring him another bottle, is surprisingly a duck for a 1935 film. Wayne does not try to conceal the fact that he's definitely checking his head. Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not great, but not as weird and random as many of LoneStar's productions of the time. The final fight is not treated very well, and Chandler becomes somewhat irritating after a while, but overall it deserves a look, if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
