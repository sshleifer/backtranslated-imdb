Amateur in the extreme. Room work is particularly overwhelmed - Documentary movie operators do not have to rotate around ALL TIME. The script is really inappropriate, and the act is even worse. In addition, the story is split and whirling - with some holes in logic. At one point the leadership wants to be thrown into prison to rub their shoulders with Al-Quada's alleged operations and thus to get an interview with Osama. I found the whole story unbelievable, as a result of so many defects. "The director" / the main role is indeed a rash, a boy idiot. The only thing of interest, indeed, is that filmmakers actually made movies on the spot. It's really a shame they scattered their opportunity to do something interesting. Who financed this stupidity?
