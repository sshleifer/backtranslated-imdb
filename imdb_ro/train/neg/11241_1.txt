If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a live video game with live artists. Visas are nice and interesting to see during the whole movie. Now, by saying that, pictures are the only good things in Captain Sky. Ten minutes later, I knew I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. We hope this movie will improve, but never has any interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to go outside increased and increased. Now, I have more than 2,000 movies and I've probably seen this number five times. However, this is just the second film I liked to go out of my life. <br /> <br /> Action --- there is nothing. The three main interpreters are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the other movie I wanted to go through) is just terrible in the lead role. I'd rather stay with Ben Affleck in Gigli than look at the law again. Paltrow tries so hard to be campy that he's back in front of her. The last article I read said Paltrow is thinking about staying at home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I would applaud this decision. Story --- Soaps are better written. The story behind Captain Sky is beginning to be bad and gets worse as he progresses. Everything has been put into special effects that the story, acting and direction suffers very much. Even "The Phantom Menace" did a better job and that does NOT say a lot. I had to give this movie a "0" of "10". Avoid paying theater fees and wait for the release of the video.
