When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. There is also a chance that the remake is so radically different that it's not too familiar with audiences. Well, the 1973 TV version of "Double Indemnity" has almost identical scenes and dialogues as the original 1944. The main difference is that the remake seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, tedious Walter Neff insurer; Richard Crenna seems to be tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's chief, Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, seems almost bored with procedures. Samantha Eggar is totally wrong because Phyllis Dietrichson, defeated, scary; While Barbara Stanwyck was just gorgeous in this bad role, Eggar is too polite and maneuvered and seems to have failed. Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as Robinson Norton's chief and John Fiedler taking Porter Hall as a crucial witness, brings life to the film. In particular, Webber recreates Norton's role in a 1970s context. However, after the film starts, it's all there, lifeless or electric. This is a movie that should not have been remapped.
