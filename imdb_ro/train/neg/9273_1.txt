The first question that comes to my mind after seeing this garbage is who gave the idiots the right to use the name Omen on this movie? It is a sinful, pitiful, pitiful attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie begins, the supporting music sounds like it was picked up directly from a Cartoon Bugs Bunny and then the movie worsens! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E - for that when they took it back to show their teacher! It's difficult, after a while, to tell him if it's a comedy, because what's happening is so fun and so true to the original Omen that he's starting to believe. The act is ridiculous, especially from the lady leader Faye Grant. she continues to shoot silly faces or is it difficult to not laugh? It's hard to say. The worst we've ever had the misfortune of being a witness. 1 out of 10.
