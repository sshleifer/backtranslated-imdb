First of all, this is a low-budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I suppose most people looking for information about this movie wanted only a bad blood, and basically that's all it is. Plot? There is none. It's basically Saw, but in China and a whole damn much worse. Cast? There is not one, period. Special effects? Very terrible in my opinion ... There were cutaways and blood was often completely unbelievable due to amounts, splashing, color, texture etc. I think the purpose of this film was to be a brutal film, shock. Now he had a great potential on a bigger budget, but a weak script, a poor dialogue, terrible action, which seemed like video cameras and simply the incredible "gore" did this really awful movie. are movies worth taking a chance against reviews, even "b-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (for example, the blood was the most recently seen against the worthwhile reviews), but that was simply terrible. I hope that people who are watching this movie read my comment and decide against it. I'm totally for brutality and shock, but unrealism and terrible action really make a terrible experience. Save time / money and chance else, you will not be disappointed.
