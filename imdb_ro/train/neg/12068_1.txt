A family of dreadful people must stay in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance, going to the servants who will receive the inheritance only if they agree to stay and keep the house in order. People die (and so will you if you try to stay in it) If you ever had the desire to see bad actors - many with dentures - act or try to act in a bad horror movie, that's your chance. That's just terrible. It's so bad I believed Al Adamson, one of the worst directors ever, but I was wrong. It's so bad I do not want to say anything more about it, not because it's not I'm not polite but because once I start I might not be able to stop
