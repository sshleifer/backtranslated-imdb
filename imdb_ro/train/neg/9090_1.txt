A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you expect an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply an anti-Sionist - nothing wrong in sustaining the destruction of a country, right?) Or uncritical in support of Palestinian goals (eg mass murder, destruction of Israel), this is documentary to you. He should make an evening of entertainments at university campuses in the UK and the US. However, anyone intellectually informed and honest would be indignant at the large number of lies presented in this video. I only hope that those who do not really know the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic dirt.
