this movie offers. the best thing is when the inconvenient teenage neighbor tries to move away from the babysitter and in the background seems to have never been near a bicycle in his life as he tries not to fall. does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later she offers a scene of nothing, but an arm that gets through a fence and in a cooler pulls a beer. stereotypical grid tattoos, several plot lines that do not go anywhere, and a former actress with a bluetooth mobile phone add up to this perfect home evening.
