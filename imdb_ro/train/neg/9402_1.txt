Why was this movie made? Even taking into account the generous tax concessions granted to Australian film investors, there can not be a reasonable explanation for this film to be in progress. For goodwill, the actors featured in this film are notorious for the Aussie (not actors such as John Hawes' John Howson, the original drummer of Hey Hey Sambata, and the type of voice in Countdown.) But saying this is still very much visible, as long as you pay attention to the brain it deserves: none. The scenario is bad (even for a b-grade blast) and the quality of the film and film is more serious. home movie, but even a home movie has "realism." Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, claims that this film NEVER has been done.
