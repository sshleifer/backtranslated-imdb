There is no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to hurt. Madchen Amick is a living proof that a person can make a living - he does not need talent. The only bright spot are some very good lines, delivered very nicely by Alice Krige, but again she is Alice Krige. Her soft, dreamy voice gives the only indication of how dangerous these strange creatures can be. She is credibly creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot. How they came to agree with this project remains a mystery. Scenario writers must have been medicated when they sent this scenario. He has major problems of continuity, stereotypical superficial characters, horror letters and simply fails to make any sense what-so-always. Creatures, while having abilities such as "dim", the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this.
