I'm sorry we bought this series. I expected more actions, a more objective image and greater coherence. This is just a series of pure, very dark propaganda, without charm or romance, is simply bored. It seems to me that the actors are working too weak. O'Donnell may look charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he has no charm. Probably as he gets older, he loses his childish charm, but he does not get any charm of a grown up. It is no surprise that it was not presented in many countries and that it is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
