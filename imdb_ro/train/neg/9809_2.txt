Some wonder why there were no longer Murphy's movies after that. It will be because this film has completely breathed. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but it would be more adult). The movie is too young, because the series of books is not. Casting is wrong for the characters. Characters do not act just as they do in books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? She's a girl in the crash books! Was this done to make the movie appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this mess. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney explode, her work was wrong. An animated film, probably in the backs of Don Bluth's works, would be suitable for a better Murphy movie. In general, I give myself a 2, because at least Disney has made a movie from a series of undervalued books. But I would like to do better. In any case, I still have my books to have fun.
