When I saw this film, around 1979, it became the first movie I ever made in the middle. There is nothing worse than the comedy that feels it is not funny, and this happens every time (although I can not speak in the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about either of them. While I enjoy the lively humor, where appropriate, these sketches were useless vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this film was published as "Robin William's first film," redeeming his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy". However, his role turned out to be so minor that you can not even see him on the screen.
