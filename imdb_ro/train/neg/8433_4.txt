Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and acts accordingly. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. She feels completely naked and decides to get drunk. When he returns home, he collapses with a girl who puts out ads. Although he ignores him, he falls in love and follows it obsessively. Well, the beginning of the movie is a bit slow and can lead to boredom for most people. However, as the action starts, it's a little better (not too much!) Maybe the best part is 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about that) that you can see in the middle of the movie ; for the heroism, but for the funny and unexpected scene that is probably the best of the movies, neither the actors nor the director are good, and the results are a boring movie that can be fun for some people for me) All the movies are based on absurd situations (idiot, as the movie says) that have something interesting, I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit it is not one of the best movies (maybe the worst!), knows how to do it good.
