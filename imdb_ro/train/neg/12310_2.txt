Steve Martin should give up trying to make classic comedy remakes. It does not fit perfectly with this part. Like the remake of "Out Of Towners," the film collapses on his face. How he ever thought Steve Martin was getting close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me and the same thing is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko side better. Martin is great when he makes his own original characters but fails to try miserably to recreate the classical work of other people. It's a sad affirmation when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of credits when the movie is over. The line "Manufacturers acknowledge the total gratitude of the US Army's lack of cooperation" was just the only line that made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Salon. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should not have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the classic Lemmon classified above and the remake of Psycho. None of them should have ever happened.
