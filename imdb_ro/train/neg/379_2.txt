The TV Guide calls this movie a mystery. What a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and genius mathematicians can not produce a single film that rises above the level of shredding that this film represents perfect. This is Bollywood at the best / worst, I honestly can not tell the difference. Sweet cupcakes, kitsch on each level, story, situation, dialogue, music and choreography. To say, you have to be a retard to enjoy it. I watched her to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to get away from her because I could not take it anymore. The only quality of the redemption of the film is the special beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
