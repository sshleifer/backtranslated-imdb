Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal blows make the film colder than it would be otherwise. The story is so poor, and Charlotte's character dies so stupidly that you wonder if this is the end they were thinking about for this film. I'd like someone to say there's an alternative ending, but I'm afraid not. As for the rest of the cSt, I would say that they simply did not behave very well; although the blame must be put on the poor scenario. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies absurdly because she was the only one who stole the show during the whole movie. I could give this movie 2/5
