When you have a naked skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a planting gift, and a nut garden, you throw a minister and his wife - what do you have? AIP responds to insomnia. br /> <br /> "Screaming Skull" gets points for boldness, offering free tapes for anyone killing to fear watching the movie. Pretty sure pack when you're amazed by people who think they are in a "Mannequin Suspicion" production. But Peggy Webber was a box anyway. He had some good moments to act here and there (especially when he tries to communicate with the gardener) and no one else fills a nightgown like her. But that scared face she's doing - scary in her own. However, as a whole, there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime. You can not be scared of this movie, it's impossible. It has its moments, but it is not enough of them. However, thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robot friends, there are more moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they have taken ("The film jumped and was very scary!"). A star for The Screaming Skull, eight and a half for the MST3K version. Talk about a shout "Screaming" ....
