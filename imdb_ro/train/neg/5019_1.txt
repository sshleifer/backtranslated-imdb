This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If higher-speed photos are faster than this, we could pay twenty dollars to go into the laundry room, popcorn, and turn the dryer. Jet Li is much better than that. All you have to do is hope he will not make any deals soon to make another cliche, such as One. If there is a movie you should avoid, it is "One".
