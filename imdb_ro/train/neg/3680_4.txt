I remember a certain Tuesday, on the morning of 18/6/02, to be exact. I stopped, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen where I watched several neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem, and I saw a smoke pillar rising from a distant point, the vision of smoke being followed a minute later by the siren shedding. I remember rushing into my bedroom, I took off my glasses, I ran back into the kitchen and saw the image of a broken bus. The bus was still near the station where a terrorist takeover went up, and with one click on a device TNT, killed 25 passengers, many of whom were at school. The wife of a good friend of mine sat on the bus to the back row, a decision apparently arbitrary and meaningless, which saved my life. I am sure that every Israeli has at least one memory teroare- he wants would have never had and it was only a matter of time before someone make a movie about it. As it turned out, the movie was about to become a repressed memory of his. The film is about a play on a dry road, Haim Buzaglo (portrayed, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who wrote and directed the film), who spends the best part of his day of running competitions with a text-processing page . Meanwhile, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a play about an ex-army army officer. Buzaglo, bored and a little paranoid because of what is medically known as "what on earth, this hot babe meets me" syndrome, asks a private eye to make a lover to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective progresses in his investigation, his observations penetrate the play and later into the lives of his actors. Meanwhile, the song becomes a comic piece in an indictment height Israeli society. As for the movie, the film becomes a frenetic editing exercise, accompanied by its small cardboard characters and unsafe dialogues, as it moves away from the subject with which it has to deal first. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard characters," I refer to the characters who, under the director's / director's obsession with a "significant" film, lacked real dialogues and a bit of reliability. I will not elaborate too much on this. Suffice it to say that I am sure that barefoot male prostitutes are rarely missing at the theater. With the intention of seeing a play, that is. <br /> <br /> This film, according to Haim Buzaglo himself, is the first part of a current agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from experiences like the one I wrote at the beginning of my analysis, unlike the withdrawn world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is nothing but convincing. <Br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in the Meter movie. <br /> <br /> PS This movie was a landmark in austerity. He was shot in ten days all expressed worked free and the entire cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I omit a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). It makes you wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the Blair Witch project.
