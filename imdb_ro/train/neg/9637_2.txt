Well, it was a bad movie! While I have not seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in meditation, led by a staff put-on when he was suddenly visited by this poet traveling with banality. In fact, the whole movie is just a speech event, with much of the discussion that makes no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or queues of this pretentious stupidity, and the passage of time made it even clearer. If it was not for the cinema and the beautiful landscape, it would be worth a negative rating. The only thing that is good for this film is its unintentional laughter at the expense of the stars.
