OK Hollywood is not a liberal. Obviously, I lie because it is. I'm a conservative, but the politics that I will leave out of my opinion about the film. This film was anti-Bush, anti-Middle East, anti-sea propaganda, but that's not the reason why it was bad. <br /> <br /> Fist off would give him credit if the credit is due. I saw the opening movie because I liked this kind of movies and I'm a major political science in the collage. The cinema was excellent and the acting was how far I could say very well. Complot was impossible for me to decode though. I was tested and I have a 138 IQ, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way I could put together the story of the movie and what characters did what they did. Story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and very poorly organized. If it's not one of those movies that should be tracked several times to get the whole depth of the story, which may be very good, I do not have the exact idea of ​​what's going on. Which makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism, make your argument impossible to criticize! If you can not blind them, then delete them with Bull S.
