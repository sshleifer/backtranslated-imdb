The movie is a little tiring. It's more of a silent movie, with most of the story being offered through a series of voices. While making a silent movie like this is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films where the lack of dialogue and repetitive scenes are simply boring. You do not understand the reason for the tedium until it's good in the picture, and until then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie are something of a slow portion of Mexican inherited pornography and soft non-imaginative pornography. Later in the movie, the style of the first 40 minutes starts to make sense, but it's too late, because until then the audience is lost. There is a beautiful location at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wonder why there are no more films shot there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that scatter the campus into a very brilliant feeling. The biggest problem with the film is that the director / screenwriter made the film the way he wanted to see it, regardless of how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
