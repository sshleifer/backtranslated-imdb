Ugh, what can I say, ugh. I rented this movie because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires. This movie could not have been a laser. Missing not only in the plot, but the action is atrocious. Together with obvious plotting holes, the film is very hard to see. Many times I questioned the health of continuing to watch the film long after the plot jumped on the shark. Here's a sample of lamer ... SPOILERS *** Professionals "Slayer" insist on sleeping outdoors by himself at night. She wakes up to a woman crying, sitting less than three feet from him in the middle of nowhere. She immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seduce, and he lets it happen with obvious results ... One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she has arrived Mexico City, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature ... The guard outside the monastery where the hero is in the night is killed by the vampires, the hero leaves the next day. He then returns one day later just to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after the departure ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
