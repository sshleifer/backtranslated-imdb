It is very unfortunate when making such a film. Much of the work and money was put into a movie that is, at best, amateur. Editing shoots, there are obvious mistakes that could easily be corrected in a second, and the soundtrack is inimaginative. So much could have been done with this video. I think they ran away early or recorded video tapes. Moving photos have a distinctly amateur feel to them.
