As an avid fan of Flashman's books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this movie was first released. Unfortunately, it was a great disappointment then - so I left him alone for 20 years before I returned to follow her again, but it was not better for the second time. Mr. Fraser is an extraordinary writer, but I'm not a fan of the movie with Richard Lester's script. The stoner comic broke the "three musketeers" for me and the same is true here. For me, the whole tone and feel of the movie is wrong. Flashman cards are funny in the parts, but they are adventure novels. There is a lot of seriousness in how the adventures of Flashman have appeared - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is transmitted in novels, but was not transmitted at all due to its comedy style. It's a tremendous shame because it could have a great movie if it was a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I read for the first time that the movie was filmed, the article said the film was about to represent Oliver Reed. I was glad, just as Reed did to me the symbol of Flashman. How would I love to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor but does not fit into Flashman's visual image of books (Flashman should be a great banderol). However, Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the movie is that it's made like a comedy. The only scene that creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). Great shame, as production values, costumes, sets, etc. are gorgeous and pouring is generally excellent - almost everyone in the film is different from Malcolm McDowell. Eventually, Richard Lester's director was responsible for the way the movie is, because the recent radio adaptation of "Flash For Freedom," adapted by Mr. Fraser, worked well. Perhaps one day we will see that Flashman was right on the screen.
