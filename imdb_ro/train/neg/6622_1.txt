I, like many other Bachchan fans, look forward to Sholay's remake. This movie was not like that. Thank God they did not let them use the name "Sholay" in the title of the movie. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of title. Working with the room, locations, costumes, dance completely out of place, combined dialogue to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money, and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for distribution. The only unpaid actor, the ants, was the only resemblance to the first film. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did she need money to pay for Ash's wedding? Save your money, your mind and time, do not bother with this movie or the DVD when it comes out.
