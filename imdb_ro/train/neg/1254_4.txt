I saw and liked the original movie and I waited more than a remake than this one. GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No scrutiny about the scores and visuals, they are appropriate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were fine, and a handful of "supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. BAD: The monkey city escape was terrible. Characters go in circles, then suddenly somewhere in the middle of the city there are tunnels to escape. In addition, what evacuation route leads through each bedroom? The story has been split to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more meat and deserved more respect. Finally, the end was completely meaningless as it was presented. Without seeing the inevitable continuation, there is no justification for that. <br /> <br />
