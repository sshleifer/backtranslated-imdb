What happened? What we have here is essentially a solid and plausible premise and a decent and talented distribution, but somewhere the movie loses it. In fact, it never went. It was a little enthusiastic when I learned that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out she's after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his whole character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than doing more. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a comedy drama. I think if the movie would do that, it could have been very funny because both actresses are funny enough and sitting here I'm thinking of a lot of scenarios that would have been a revolt.
