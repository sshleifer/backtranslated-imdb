When many people say it's "the worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say about almost any movie they did not like. However, out of the nearly 700 films I remember ever seeing is one of the two that I have removed from feeling insulted and upset personally. This is my first review of the movie, by the way, and I signed up to IMDb just to coveted the evil of this movie. I went to see him when he was in the theater (I and my two buddies were 3 out of 5 people there) and after 15 years I do not remember much, but my attitude to leave the theater is still clear. <br /> <br /> --- Alert Spoiler --- <br /> <br /> Oh, where to start. Loss of fat left at the altar, going on a ski weekend, meeting the blonde bomb that is interested in him, taking him home to meet with the family, being cannibal and the essence, the pathetic attempt to escape dramatically, and giving the way with my brother's girlfriend, I live happily afterwards. Puke. First of all, the gags are so bad that it took me some time to understand that she was trying to be FUNNY and that it was a COMEDY. The special effects, which few exist, look like they were made 15 years earlier. The big dramatic finale was so hiccous that it was almost unbearable to look (he beats the whole rabbit cannibal family sitting in the lawn that rises in the style of Tom and Jerry when he heads to them). I'm sure there are many, many more, but I do not intend to see again for a refresh.
