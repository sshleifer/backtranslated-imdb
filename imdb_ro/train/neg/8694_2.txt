Feminine leadership was a terrible actress who made the film mediocre. She smiled too much when she first entered the rooms to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect it. I would have been inconsolable in the same situation. It seemed quiet to a mother who could not find her daughter. It was like he did not want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the role better. And he would have made much more money for such a controversial and important subject. All the others were excellent. I do not know where the lead actress is, but I hope he has some acting lessons.
