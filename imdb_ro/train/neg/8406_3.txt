A memorable line from a short-lived show. After watching the episode where the line was introduced, my football team in the French pavilion began using the line to break our music. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter said that FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered START! A fun way to break the bad luck in which our opponents scratched their heads, very few of them watching the show. Using this line we added a unique feature for our season, which I will never forget. I had the best season during my college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun I had with using this line. The show was pretty much a stinker, but she lives in the memories of Pi Kappa Phi football team from West Virginia Tech.
