This is an art film made either in 1969 or in 1972 (The National Film Conservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film seems to be highly suited for this general time period - with some camera techniques and art pop art that are from the late 60s and early 70s. The film is three simple images which are distorted using various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. This was obviously intended as almost a form of performance art, and like most performing arts, it is interesting at first, but it becomes quickly tiring. The film, to put it even more, is a total perversion and would not attract anyone but those who made the film, their family and friends, and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with him" to be grasped by mortals.
