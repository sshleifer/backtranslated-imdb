I like monster movies in general. Even if they are unlikely and stupid. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so unlikely and stupid and tries to take it all seriously at the same time. Like in a way really a way at all. While the idea is somewhat real, such as Orcas are known for killing the White Shark, it's really hard to find it scary when I can only see Shamoo's furious thing destroy. Especially that a scene in which a building exploded the cause of the orc ... and as it exploded, things jumped out of the water and felt like I was looking at a Sea World show with fireworks. In addition, they kill many scary moments before they see that they will happen. In addition, some jabs are needed at JAWS. It's like "Hey, we're fictional and we can come up with better reasons why Orca is attacking." Yes, you ignore the exaggerated situation **** in logic, of course. But JAWS had something the movie does not have. It's scary. Yes, unlikely. Yes, somewhat outrageous. But honestly, actually or not, a killer shark is not nearly as scary as a big white. And the poor attempt to develop and write the character just hurts more. Even JAWS revenge is more frightening than that.
