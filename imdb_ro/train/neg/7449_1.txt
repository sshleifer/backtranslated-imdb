Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, there are no romantic scenes, changes in the story, too short, appeared at a low budget. Dialogue is not enough to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, Lorna seems to have a cool cold on her upper lip. I'm sure makeup was better to hide it. I think they did not want to stop shooting until they got cured, pity. Most likely why this movie did not have kisses. Only a disappointing kissing scene at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic story and must be said true. Lorna Doone's 2000 version is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and true to the book.
