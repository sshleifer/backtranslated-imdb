Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dead nut, lonely, living in the Morhenge Mansion with some servants, and tells his friend, "Do not try to make me a doctor, Doctor, I'm a disgusting healthy!" He invites his grandchildren and grandchildren at home and warns them that they have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?) *** SPOILERS *** Morteval / Karloff ends with to die and the killers of the "toys" (projected by his dead brother) begin killing relatives. A mini-cannon launches real bullets in a typical face, a living-size knight in armor attacks with an ax and a sheik dancing people with a knife. A guy who is strangled makes some hilarious faces. Eventually, Julissa and her boyfriend find Karloff still alive and hiding in the dungeon where the steel gates close in the room. He plays thematic music of recurring organs (a sort of death noise used for killing), the spirit of the brother begins to speak ("the whole house will go with me!"), And the manor goes up in flames. <br /> <br /> This meaningless mess is too dark, boring, and the stupid dialogue never matches your lips.
