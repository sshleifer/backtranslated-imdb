and rent a horror movie. It's as if the screenwriter had never seen a horror film, and he did not realize that every thing he wrote was scratched, he died and was parodied to perfection in films such as "Scream" and "Scary Movie ". <br /> <br /> Between scary bits is the biggest part of the BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "we go to the ball". I wanted to get my ears off. Honestly, Hills has a better dialogue. No need for this movie. Lady lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking "Was it really? Guy is obsessed with it?" All the characters act badly, including in the police. and from behind! No sleepy policeman sitting in the car with the window overturned, waiting for his neck to be cut off.) The serial killer only binds on killing anyone who wants to have no trouble, no resistance to the victims Nobody has the protection or the slightest idea to fight back (or to overturn the safety lock on the hotel room door) People are like the sheep with mental disabilities By means of being a gore fan, you will be disappointed All the killing is kept on the screen and is made with taste (So boo hoo for you!) None of the crimes is a little interesting, most of the time we have already happened when we find out. The only cliff his missing was the cat that always appears in such films. - You scared me! I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE! <br /> <br /> <br /> And then the end when it's time for the killer to mill ... Well, let's say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience was jerking and talking back on the screen all the time. It was too bad to believe and it was not scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy film. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way - no coronation of a ball or queen king, no tiara, no bucket of blood) <Br / <br /> So save your money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday 13" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or "Scary Movie" (any of them).
