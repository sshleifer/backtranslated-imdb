The film industry in the UK is not controlled. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why should they be filmed with nobodies talents? This film destroys the courage of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless and fluffy romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" can not be Orwell's best work, but no one who reads it can forget the beautiful image of poverty. Orwell highlights not only cold and hunger but humility to be poor. In the novel, London is a gloomy, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays that it will be destroyed by a squadron of bombers. But this movie saves everything that can be in any way disturbing and instead creates a cheerful nostalgic journey in the charming 1930s London, where everything is lit with golden sunlight trees and even the Lambeth slopes are picturesque and filled with fresh bears and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind that traversed the streets sprinkled by garbage seemed completely unclear in this world of chocolate. The worst of all is the unusual bounty of the script, the old jokes and the clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock and the film is packed with great actors. But there is nothing. This movie made me so upset! The history of British literature is something proud of its richness, complexity and power. And what about her? We use soft nobodies to turn it into soft-centered, anodic popes for people who want to feel that they "become a culture" while they drink their Horlicks and quietly disappear.
