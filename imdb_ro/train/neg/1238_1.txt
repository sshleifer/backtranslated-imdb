This remake of Tim Burton about 1968's original "Planet of Monkeys" (and with Charleton Heston) is a cry far and away from the quality and plot of the original. Certainly, special effects have improved since 1968, but writing did not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was terrible. I spent the whole movie with a friend (who fortunately hired him) and fully understood why, before Christmas, all Target's "Planet of the Apes" were in the trash. My advice Tim Burton: Do not put this on your resume. My advice to anyone else: Watch the original film 1968 "The Planet of the Monkeys".
