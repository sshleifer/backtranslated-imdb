In fact, I've been watching this drama twice, because I could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we lost something ... no, what's missing has been lost since the beginning of pre-production. In fact, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I found the problem and found that what I thought was amusing and exciting that day is now so much disconnected and fuzzy head-junk. <br /> <> So, the initial problem with the movie was decided to do it entirely, and the rest of the train progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - it's not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor photos are destroyed by random placement of indoor chambers. All the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix, which gives the impression she is not too conscious of how horrible her performance is. Dialogue is one, long, steady. Scenes do not make sense from second to second, and links do not exist. Still, the film is blindly constrained, convinced that it says something profound. This is too bad to be even funny; it's simply weird. Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-miraculous films that I encourage you to see and I'm happy to have survived (and seems to have learned from) this misery.
