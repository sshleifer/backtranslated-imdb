Man must say that when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking evil vampires led by Michael Ironside veteran .... In space. I mean, I did not expect high-tech, but it resembles a classic B movie. It was undoubtedly a television pilot, re-edited some time later in a feature film after it was not over. Okay, I'll start with the movies a few good points, the action was responsible for a budget below, and the CGI and the used locations were acceptable. Now, the bad guy, Michael Ironside first was barley in this scene, and his performance here ... was not too cheese, not in a good way. But, as I said it was not, anyway, so I can not blame him. A very stupid thing was the PETA group for Vampires, I'm not kidding, it's the worst thing I've seen over time and it's taken seriously. It also makes one of B's ​​major sins, teases a lesbian scene and fails. Above all that sinks this movie nothing happens. Because it was meant to be a pilot, the scenario is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the chief offenders, they only come to an end. If you ever need a movie to raise the Sleaze and Gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. In conclusion, I will say that the space crew's main crew were very capable actors and could well put this mess behind them and go to bigger and better things. There was no reason to work here.
