One of them: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two comics turns into septic for an injured child. They both sold it, worse than Pryor's character. Two: Horrible, too sentimental scripture that could have been used in a given Harold Lloyd film. Three: Choosing a black actor as a toy; the racial subtext of this is unbearable, as never addressed. There is no message here, Pryor's part could have been interpreted by a comedic actor. Four: That baby ... I'd like to go back and prevent him from ever acting ... that would mean movies like this and Kid Co. they may not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their mental power. So, if you want to watch some big comics, you can rebound in a short baby movement, let go of it. If you want to see them in something good, you see Pryor and Gleason's old act in something better than Honeymooners.
