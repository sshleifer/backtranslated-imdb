The dialogue is embarrassed and uninspired, with a few lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The last sequence of action takes place in a police station, as well as a recipe from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one-bottle office, which Darkwolf does not fat him up. Finally, the girl calls the hero "a good protector", but he receives both partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen, all killed without a hit decency. despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a machine gun.
