I do not know what the other guy was thinking. The fact that this film has been made independently makes it even less terrible. You can be as faithful as you want ... most of this film is worthless. I feel I was insulted that I have to look at the first 40 minutes of it. And that was not a small act. Not only does it act terribly, but the plot is never close to being developed. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call a story. I have never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I've written here, and the purpose is just to save all the audience there for an hour and a half of your life. I do not remember the last time I could not even finish watching a movie. He really takes the cake.
