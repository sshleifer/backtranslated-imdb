from the beginning of this movie, you will soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself of looking at a naked woman watched by men in silly masks for the servants who run in the worst clothes on I've ever seen it and all these in subtitles make this kind of movie that you should think twice about seeing and as the movie moves slowly along you soon you realize that the vampire is not a vampire you have to ask where the title came from some parts of the movie a bit of sense with Pierre and he's the father, but as the movie gets to its really stupid end, you have to think about finishing a movie in this way and be surprised that they had a better end if only in this head is not a movie to watch virtually
