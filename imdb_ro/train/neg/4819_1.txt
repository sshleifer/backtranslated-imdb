This is a typical low-budget misery since the 1970s. It should be a docudrama about a team that hunts Bigfoot through the Northwest Pacific. Each character is a stereotype, from the native American to the cynical cowboy. Act and narrative are a total joke. If you hoped to see a lot of big pictures - keep on hoping. There will not be much and what could be done in your yard with a cheap costume and a video camera; would look better than this movie. It's not that I do not like the low budge rate of 1970; Do. It's such a disaster to act badly, bad characters, a bad story, and the lack of emotions that you just can not enjoy. It does not fall into the category "so bad is good", nor can you laugh at how bad it is without the use of illicit substances. It's more like a boring record of camping people, hiking, horseback riding, and watching wildlife. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely bad; suppose our friend Sasquatch throws rocks on the top land as they pull their rifles back. At this point you are hardly rooted for the bigfoot to drop some stones on the ends of the movie and stop everything.
