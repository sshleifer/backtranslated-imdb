This is really terrible: painted artists irritating the sparkle and sprouts inconsistent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, no beginning, no middle, no end, cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intent, all in service, some "totally uninteresting" and almost undetectable stories. What makes it worse is the film's "modeling" demands: suddenly a remote-head crane shot the spirals down and without any apparent reason there are sudden whips or wobblyhand sections: all this " style "misconception, almost unbelievable, of the project and almost lack of offensive material. Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made.
