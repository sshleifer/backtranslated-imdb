After reading the book, which was of great significance to me, the film did not give me any sense that the book gave them. This makes me wonder if Kaufman really liked this book because he did it successfully in something else. Whether it is or simply stupid. The most important is where is the ease? From the first scene, music drowns most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues through the movie. I think the producers believed that by having an optimistic music playing through the movie, this would make the story feel easy - however, they have failed completely here. Instead, the music succeeds in giving everything the "movie" feels in a manner of dramatizing the events so that we stay on them so that everything feels hard. Another example of how this adaptation fails is to adorn the story line, making it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina. The introduction of this haphazard / passing encounter, which certainly did not happen in the book, gives Tomas's story more significance than it makes it easy. There are many other examples where the continuity story was changed, imo for the worst, but this would have been because the book simply did not turn out well in a movie, such as Kundera's style. This makes us wonder if all the generous commentators on this site were writing about their experience of book and film instead of writing about the film. A movie that's as long as it's unbelievable. For those who have not read the book, I recommend that you just read this. For those who have, I have to say that you are simply wasting your time and you will probably end up here by writing similar similar residence warnings.
