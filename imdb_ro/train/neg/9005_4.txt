If Alien, Jurassic Park and other countless horror movies are your tea, add a bunch of sugar and you'll let it down. The film begins in cheerful old England around 1100ad and then jumps to California today. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new head of security and military adviser for a scientific laboratory, 400 meters underground. He arrives (and Carver is a helicopter pilot) with the Scientist leader and soon we find that he is a cloning lab and have something new found to clone. Is it dinosaur or what? As in the case of the above films, all hell breaks out and our characters start to be lifted. The special effects on Monster are pretty good for a "movie straight" movie, and Dean Cain does what he gets for him. But forget the rest of the group when we find out why I have never seen it before. Again, do not come in with great expectations and you will be fine.
