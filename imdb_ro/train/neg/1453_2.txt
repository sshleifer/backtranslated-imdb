I'm not sure it's language or bad action, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake. After seeing Der Untergang this is a great disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and the act is so incredibly poor that I did not even think that people could do such a mess of something that would have great potential. Above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. German language has a certain sound, and especially, Hitler himself only calls Hitler when he speaks / screams German. The way the story is told made me think it was improvised on the spot, the characters were naked and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened. If it's English or the fact that I've seen Der Untergang, all about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
