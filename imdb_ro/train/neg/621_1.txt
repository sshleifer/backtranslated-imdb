Holy @ #% & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to look at this pile of raging waste, but it was easier for me to break my wrists and turn a Lysol floor cleaner shoe than to bear more than half of the crap that was on my screen . I rank much lower than anything I have ever seen on film or TV, and that says something. I once saw a crap of a cow in a field. I've been looking at the steam stack for an hour and a half, who knows ... could have moved or something. Well, it was more time spent than watching this shit. The act was non-existent, the plot was somewhere else than on this film. I think I saw a cut saw earlier, where the parcel managed to escape and was behind an old truck heading for Portland in the hope of becoming a Steven King hawk. Please tell me that the director receives the drugs he desperately needs. It is quite clear he needs heavy drugs and I would like to take the money to reverse lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the fist she needs, because nothing can do so painful in the given word. Let me tell you that if you want to make a short pass and see this Chilton on the support, go to your car, turn on the engine, then push your fingers into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate more . Make sure you have your wallet in your hand, too, because you were going to waste money anyway. You may have the privilege of wasting yourself. By the way, I looked at this after a "friend" of mine sent my girlfriend to see him. He came upon him, and he also had it. What's worse is that you had to follow this from $% & @ TWICE! I heard they were getting married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
