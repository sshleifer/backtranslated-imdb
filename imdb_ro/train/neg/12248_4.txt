The only culmination of the film is the death of the guy who is spinning and the reaction of the characters that survive him. In any other way, this movie is a very strange game of Jaws, Lake Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in. As a standard for a horror film of 1990, the two females who do not have the role of taking their clothes at least once. Feminine leadership does not have, because it obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surrounds the shooting of an extremely bad sport called surfing in the blood, where surfers cut and sail in shark-infested waters. In this movie, a giant saltwater crocodile is also going to be in the area. People eat. The movie is over. I do not mind a bad horror film, but I really hate a terrible horror movie, which is certainly.
