Phantom of the Mall is a movie that best suits the "forgotten" category. It's a pretty bad version on Gaston Leroux's famous story, Phantom of the Opera. It's not a bad idea for herself, but the plot and the production of this movie are much weaker to pay homage to this story. From the bright side, Gaston Leroux does not have to return to the grave yet. It could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many unnecessary flashbacks in it and too many boring sequences to make it memorable. Also, scriptwriters wanted to give too much stories to the story than needed. And even if there is a lot of mystery that accumulates about Eric's character ... the basic plot is common and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** This is a young couple who is brutally destroyed because the boy is killed in a fire. The fire was put in his house because he and his parents refused to sell his house to make room for a huge mall to be built. The boy survived the fire and hid in the mall to take revenge. Meanwhile, he keeps his girlfriend working now in the mall and tries to forget her loss. **** SPOILERS END *** This simple plot - but quite efficient - gets thickened by a lot of unnecessary elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should be just a fun horror movie, it desperately tries to be a smart thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are some innovative crimes, but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to see a horror movie. And in addition, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a bit of humor! All production - the distribution included - is too serious. <br /> <br /> I'll try to finish with some positive aspects ... Like, for example, she sees Ken Foree !! Die-hard horror fans will surely recognize Peter as the dawn of the dead! It is like a milestone that still has to be found in equality. Even if his role in this film is limited and even completely useless ... it was good to see it again. TV fans will recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she is a beautiful actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this, but I can not resist him ... so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. Finally, a bit of praise for the lead actress called Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and she has a little talent ... too bad she never managed to get to the top. In fact, this film is his greatest achievement and he says a lot about his career ...
