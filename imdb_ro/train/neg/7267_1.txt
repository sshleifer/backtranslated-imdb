This movie is simply too long, too repetitive, and male nudity and sexuality (as a homosexual with my own collection of adult titles) are too free and useless. A large part of the first third of the film could have been reduced to ten minutes and would be as effective without trying the patience (and resistance) of an audience. I saw this movie one afternoon with an audience of the film festival; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as a dialogueless one, shorts, foreign movies. Almost everyone sold in a theater with a capacity of about 275 seats began to break down in the first half of the film and while the vast majority remained for the "salary" (which never arrived), never About 14 years of attending any number of film festivals, experimental, homosexual or otherwise, has seen such a large number of people moving away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily be cut by more than half and was as effective as it would have been. It could also go in different directions, but with a shorter and much more efficient time. Because there is at present, this is not something that can be easily recommended or one that I would have any desire to look back on.
