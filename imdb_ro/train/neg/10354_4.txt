I navigate through Netflix and I came across this movie. Having beautiful memories of the book as a child, I decided to check this out. This is a movie you should really promote. It is not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel like it is for small children. He does not have the magic the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you just will not care for ten minutes in it. There are moments that just come strange. The character of the wizard is not very good. The family acts as if it is not much that these strange things happen. I know this is a children's film, so for a more advanced audience, we do not have to look too much at things, but the movie feels like it's written and produced by people who have never experienced anymore shooting. <br /> <br /> <br /> The DVD I started jumping at the final moments of the movie and instead of trying to fix it, we stopped it and sent it back to Netflix. I did not care how it was done. Go over this movie and read the book instead.
