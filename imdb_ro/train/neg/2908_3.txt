Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and might be a brilliant literature, this film adaptation is really bleak, because it's rather a fight against sleep than cinematic fun. The story relates to an old couple whose son died and lived a heavily-influenced life where the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a cocktail head battle. I have no mood to spread more words on this unnecessary pretentious piece, maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but stay 90 minutes in front of your screen just for that? No, thanks.....
