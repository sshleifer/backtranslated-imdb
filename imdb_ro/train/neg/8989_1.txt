There are some good things about the movie. Music and cinema are great. Alex Wilson is hot and offers great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. Production was very lucky because it poured them, because they really give the movie value. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the boys in the movie that do not speak are too cute. Why is not the actress playing Amy in credits? Brandon Alexander offers a great comic interpretation like Clitarissa Pink. The worst thing about the film is probably the star, James Townsend. Can not act. He is also very upset, not nice to look at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone. No wonder he has to make his own film and throw himself into it. No one else threw him into anything. James Townsend is not credible as someone who even has a girlfriend because she behaves so gay. Somebody else should have done as a leader if he wanted the best for the movie. Then again, he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to launch a career in soft-core pornography, he certainly did not really play because he would take some acting lessons. In addition, anyone who makes porn is included in the blacklist in Hollywood. The most ridiculous thing about the film is probably casting a naked Latina with Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem to be an actress. Generally, this movie is soft-core porn and is no better than something you'll see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by him and does not want to associate with him. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable stage name. Besides, I came to him in West Hollywood once again and when I mentioned this movie, he came back and left. I understand. If I had worked on this movie, I would be embarrassed and I would not want to be associated with that either.
