In my opinion, this film does not advance any new thought. it seems like taking a spear on a spear without looking at the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Really! I think his rational lack seems to be the place for alternative vision. For each other, I'm usually on the side of the naysayer, but this film has no credibility, because it is based on the fantastical observations of the man / woman on the street. right now, if you want to create a credible alternative to a creed sustained for 2000+ years, you need to make more effort to allow the other party to express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie, it seemed to me an attack on Christian faith, because one is a believer, but he allows the beliefs of others and would not want to ridicule them, but to try to understand and tolerate.
