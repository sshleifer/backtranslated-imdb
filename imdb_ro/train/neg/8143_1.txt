I had the distinct dissatisfaction of seeing this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I attended this festival for over 5 years and I certainly saw some occasional poor movies. However, "First Bite" has reached a new level of film. Despite having been shot in beautiful, occasionally delicious, close to fabulous food, the film contracted an excessive number of plot overturns and cluttered characters until it almost begun to end. Main actor, David La Haye, has failed to show any character evolution throughout the film, portraying a pompous chef from start to finish. Additional superstructures, such as eating disorders, were developed so badly and completely that they did not fit in any context in which the film had appeared up to that point. A theme of mysticism has been used as a weak attempt to hide a film that does not touch anything, it does not go anywhere and completely disappoints.
