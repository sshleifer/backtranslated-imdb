The film begins with a voice that tells the audience where they are and who they are. And this is the moment when I began to dislike my movie. With all the endless possibilities that any film director has in his hand, I really find a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation through a voice of telling everything. In fact, I think your works are betrayal of the concept of filming. I do not like to hear from a voice about telling where we are, at what date we are and, especially, what the characters feel and think. I think a director has to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after the evil influence input, a very striking film starts and continues for a long enough time. The life of a middle class family and of all members individually are illustrated in a perfectly realistic way. I think the director has a talent to capture real situations. For example, a father who has to make private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us to situations that would seem abnormal, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer about real life. But that's it. After a while, realism in the film begins to sacrifice the story. I felt as if I had a headache because of the non-stop nature. It was as if the actors and the actress were given their subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogues. It is realistic, but the characters always demand "really, it is," etc., one another or characters that say "no" or "you listen to me" ten times when I say that only once is enough makes me have a headache. I also think the books of practice and reading are more than they should be. I understand that the play and the movie in the movie are very related to the plot, but I think the director missed the point where those scenes should not be shown.
