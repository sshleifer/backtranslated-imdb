First, I have to say I liked the Animal Farm book. I read it with the 9th grade, and it was great. I also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The film was so disappointing to me. The movie eliminates some characters and loses many of the main points of the book. It jumps around and does not explain anything in detail. If someone were watching this movie without first reading the book, it would be confusing. The most disappointing thing in this movie for me was the end. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and the men in an alliance and kind of "melting" together, but instead the movie made it look like the animals would revolt against the pigs. To summarize, I do not think this movie captured the true meaning Orwell introduced in his book.
