Remember that the smoking channel was exposed to 60 minutes a few years ago? This is it. A lot of people have analyzed this film without checking the goodwill of filmmakers. Manufacturers quickly used false promotions without revealing the financial and philosophical fundamentals for this piece of marketing. If you believe in sewer, reincarnation, new age and baloney a day, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you'll give him a lot of money. If you can walk on the Ramtha site without screaming insecure, then maybe you think the money you got rid of from the infomercial for madness was well spent. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
