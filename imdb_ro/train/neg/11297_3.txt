Jenny Neumann (from MISTRESS OF THE APES, American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays a leading role in Australian stage production. She's a virgin because, as a little girl, she saw her mother doing sex and then accidentally causing the car accident that killed him. Meanwhile, a murderer with black gloves is walking around the theater, kicking with fists. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, washing her blood on her hands after murders, and seeing killing a baby molester with a broken bottle like a little girl!) but this has a free POV workload of great weight and hides the identity of the killer until its end, as it should have been a big surprise. The entire castle seems obsessed to talk about, to have or to try to have sex and, in one case, even blackmailing its way into established set-up. There is a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, photography is cloudy, and editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The director for a movie with a slash before Soavi's film of the same name and OPERA Argento (both are better than that) for another five years, and Neumann is hot enough.
