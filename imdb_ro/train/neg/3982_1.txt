For the love of God, please do not see this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, just like romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this movie and its predictable evil villain are just blades. The characters are not developed, and most of the film is adorned with photographs of Rome, which is more interesting than the real movie. First, the act is a shame. I know everyone is trying to find a niche, but it's really a disaster. I can not believe that someone really paid millions of pounds to put this movie on the screen. Do not waste money or time on this movie, visit your grandmother or something worthwhile in return.
