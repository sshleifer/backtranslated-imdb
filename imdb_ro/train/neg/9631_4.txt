The film is addressed to the audience thanks to Ben Stiller's charisma and J. Aniston's notoriety. It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there is nothing successful in this movie. Polly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the type of character that fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> Bem Stiller is the same annoying type as in "meet parents," but in this film the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. very poor, with nothing special. With these two well paid actors, things could be much better - but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script. 4 out of 10.
