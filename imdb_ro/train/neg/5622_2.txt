OK, apart from the psychedelic background images, the information presented here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, it just did not fit with this movie at all). Regarding the content of the film, the director often brings - the inattention of a pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a surprising comparison of the facts and events of Christ's life to the lives of mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he creates the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents an "ok" case, but not one that broke out. If the director were left with the facts and would continue with them, this movie would have been good. Still, at this moment, the film disintegrates into a group of personal attacks pleasing to Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and at a private Christian school that the director has attended to his youth. During an interview with his old director, (who in the course of his life came to light the fact that the director faced false claims), I felt that the director was quite childish. He asked good questions, but, like the movie itself, the interview crashed into an attack on the rules of this particular school, and not of Christianity. Generally, if you're interested in some information, watch the first 30 minutes or so and then turn it off.
