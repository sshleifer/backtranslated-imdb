This is a bad and bad movie. I'm a real guardian: believe me when I say that the pretense of the precision movie is just that. This is especially true during that bleak little scenes in which the snakes combine work with the popular legs of the 1980s. The end is predictable, and the movie is a play from the beginning to the end. Horrible.
