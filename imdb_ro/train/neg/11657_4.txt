"Scary Movie 2" is a release of Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this was kind of boring and not very funny. Fortunately, they chose the act after it and made another two great movies. This film is about a group of teenagers who are grabbed by their teacher to go to a haunted mansion for a night. Things begin to deceive, and then they realize they have to escape. This movie is not horrible, but it could have improved several things. It's a bit fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, then give it a watch - but I do not think you would love it just as much.
