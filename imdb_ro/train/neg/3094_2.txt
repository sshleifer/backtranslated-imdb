**** MINI SPOILERS *** As a connoisseur of the bad movie, you must have seen hundreds of bad movies and yet "Hobgoblins" differs from everything else in its unique way. Bad players, such as "The Terror Creeping," "The Mighty Gorga," and "Manos," are uniformly evil from start to finish. "Hobgoblins," on the other hand, starts badly and becomes progressively worse as it goes. During my first show on the rake scene with infamous rake, I thought it was a really bad movie. I did not realize I saw the best of this movie. The film takes its most massive dirt in celluloid hell during the painful "Club Scum" sequence, which is a continuous row of a non-functional joke after another. With this single film, director Rick Sloane proves to be worth mentioning, along with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane, one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can it be a bad movie? Look at "Hobgoblins" and do not bother.
