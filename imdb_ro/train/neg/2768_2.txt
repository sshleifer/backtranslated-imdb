This movie was horrible. They did not develop any of the characters, and the story was horrifically played. It was a definite sleep. You would expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be his strengths, but D-Wars surprises you even with a link in that department. <br /> <br /> The act was just one step above the level of a low-budget porn movie. And I myself understand that. I was actually happy to see the final credits on this because it was just so bad! Please do whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in a movie like D-Wars.
