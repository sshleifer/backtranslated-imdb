Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution back to the world of his gangsters. How can a director have a distribution with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very wonderful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in distribution. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ("The pleasure in your killing!") <br /> <br />
