Pretty one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible action, ridiculous "action" (it is clear that cars are traveling slowly), atrocious scenes, endlessly ending incompetent and ending make a movie hash. We know Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this. There is not a lot of tension in the car and when the characters are hampered in moments of hope, they laugh like harmless banshees for some reason, even "five in height" when they see the bridge down! Also, the chain of events that causes these people to share the same credibility of the cars. Apparently based on true events, though? In this case, the truth is obviously more alien than fiction! Unfortunately, it was portrayed in such an ineffective manner.
