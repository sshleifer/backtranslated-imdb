Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to interfere with serious television reports. When a job he begs for him, he is fired. His beautiful, but naked girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also tells herself. Coming home, Tim is surprised to discover that his home has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) on Mars! Calling Uncle Martin, Tim tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim, but the course of true love does not work well in this case, either. Soon everyone on television watches Tim, hoping to tell about a real alien. What is a man to do? For those who have loved the old television show of the same name, along with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to bind the proverbial boots. Indeed, no doubt horrible, without any plot and dependence on the alleged special effects that also collapse. Daniels is good for the earth, but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien, surpassing a storm. The rest of the cast is appropriate, as well as the costumes, set and production details. Even if children see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to choose another movie at the video store. Make sure kids and adults find this movie a colossal hole, so choose one night at the Museum or around the world in 80 days.
