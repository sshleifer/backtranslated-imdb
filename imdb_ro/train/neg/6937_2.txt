The most recent adman-transformed-filmist subject attempts to deal with his debut (ad), venture is quite an old subject of discussion of almost any cultural-romantic standard over time (with intent to play). However, exploration (and exploitation for Desi Auds) falls roughly, as the usual "burns, spices and sugar" tendencies to the usual blend of b / g score, dialogue, dance , drama etc creates a beautiful package not much in. In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the scene of the kitchen was repeated at least 8-9 times. Subsequent repetitions follow the movie (after the main character is a chef). But there is a problem wood - no story! Come on, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. Amitabh puts into a Chey Jyada (more) a quantity of over-acting. Even when will this guy ever stop? He's been around for about 60 years, even when he's teased by a 30-something niggle? He has a momentary mind, yes, but certainly not about the point of age? And unique? Sorry, soul? Reasonably, Paresh Rawal works well, having the only sensitive role in the film. The director has no sense of realism to get him into the newfound discovery of a new idea. Nowhere have we presented any problems or real life issues that such a pair could face, other than marrying, which is just the initial obstacle. The sub-plot of a small child with cancer (the first love of the dragon boy) does not go anywhere, and no matter how small a headache, this otherwise insipid presentation would have been evoked quickly along with the girl's character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, try nice, but not yet there.
