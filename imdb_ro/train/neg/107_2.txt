If the crew behind the "Zombie Chronicles" has ever read this, here are some guys: 1. In a "Twist Ending" movie, it's not a good idea to insert close to every moment of the movie "EVERY DEATH IN THE FILM" in the opening credits. That tends to ruin twists, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you produced this on a driver and - to be fair - you did wonders with your budget, but please, hire people who can act effectively. Or, at least, walk, talk, and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I look at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to create a part of your movie in the past, do so only if you have props and costumes of time. <br /> <br /> 4. Questions about twist should be a surprise. Sure, we do not want reversals that make no sense but the signaling of "disclosure" as soon as you enter a character? This is not a great idea. Kudos for the guys for the try, but with all honesty, I would prefer that they did not have ... Just for zombie completists.
