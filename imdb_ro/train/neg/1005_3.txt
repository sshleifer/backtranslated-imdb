When you go to an outdoor cinema during summer Greek summer, you usually do not care what the movie is! Edison started very well with a good effort from the singers - who wanted to be actors and once again great Morgan Freeman, but ... (in a movie there is usually a good start to catch the audience, done, a bit boring, however, the story of filming, which is more about characters and less about action, and the third part is something very good to remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite police officers can destroy a building) pulls a guy behind a car, fails to hit him even once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy takes a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3) Do you realize that the Greek summer sky full of stars is too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
