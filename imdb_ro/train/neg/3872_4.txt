The movie does not become intolerable to watch. And to call law has nothing to show, except maybe Alicia Silverstone sexy in an unlucky character, revealing dresses sexy enough. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see in any way. There are no suspense, little action, unimpressive dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same dull locations, and very gentle action. Kevin Dillon is totally worthless. Silverstone ... well, I did not focus too much on her acting, I confess. However, as I said earlier, if someone has nothing to do but watch a movie, this will not seem so bad. 4/10
