Yes ... this is defined there with some of the worst MSTified movies, but I certainly saw it worse. I think Gremlins rated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at a science-fi convention, which amazingly he was teaching! It was one of those very low budget conventions, where everything goes, every one brought something (if you want to see nonsense, you should see what I and some friends have brought). <br /> <br /> He looked like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments about Hobgoblins and even told me not to take him seriously and he told me he loves the MST3K ! Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was supposed to be bad like Mars Attacks. So I think I'm standing up for this movie, giving it a 5 and betraying all my MST colleagues. I'm sorry guys.
