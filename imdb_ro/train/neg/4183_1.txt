If it was not for Oh So Gourgous, Natassia Malthe, this B movie would not have deserved a sector of my Tivo space! In what low rent deposit, was the alleged port space portrayed behind? "Persons of continuity!" It's a basic principle in real shooting! By night, a supposed space port and day (day and night on a space station?) A warehouse! People! The only thing I'm gonna praise for this movie is the wardrobe closet. for continuity, keeping Natassia in those bands that reveal the form! Even the women who saw this bomb have to appreciate the costumes they have spent, obviously, on every shooting day! The Sci-Fi channel would have been better to show SpaceBalls! At least there would have been a real humor in looking at something so incredible. Michael Ironside, please tell your agent as soon as possible! You are so much better than an actor, to be even associated with this level of filming.
