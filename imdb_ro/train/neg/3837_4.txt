I've seen (too many) movies from this company - this is about the middle of the package. A good part, less stylized and controlled than some of the lowest prices - less sophisticated humorous attempts and more adherence to the story (what it deserves). Many of their titles, such as Sixth Sense Sexy, are buried in baaaad performance and amateur sensitivity. On the other hand, I found simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other films (such as Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). Misty Mundae is always a 10-meter peter, like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot in a rather lame way, and Ruby LaRocca a little sexy. You look firmly in your hand (free) one night when you need a break from pornography. Do not waste your time wishing to check the story - you have more to do in your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but it's not bad for this standard.
