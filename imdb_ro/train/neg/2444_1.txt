Two houses, a street, a telephone booth, a car, a joining girl, a boy next to a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great movie. All you need is a blue light, ambient music and ... made. But it is not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "evil film evenings" from time to time. The concept is very simple: to get some drink, get some friends who love the movie and immerse yourself in the worst cinema. For such an evening this peace of dirt is one of the best. Rates are guaranteed! The bizarre thing is that van Rouveroy still defends his film as if it were a great achievement. In order to witness this, you will have to listen to the commentary on the DVD. Again: I do not believe and laugh guaranteed!
