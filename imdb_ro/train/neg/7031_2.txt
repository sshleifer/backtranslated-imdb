What made me watch the movie was watching Vampyres, I thought I had to get the other movies that this guy made (Larroz), I'm sorry I followed this, it's a poor attempt at a the occult / satanic film with sex and sex only (with actors and ugly actresses, this is an excuse for laziness.) The only redeeming factor was setting and atmosphere, avoiding it, too much hype surrounding it, not worth the effort to find it of course, I have other films that live up to Vampyres, Oh and the goat scene was very dull, I understand that's what hype is all about.
