It seems strange that someone read this scenario and thought: "It's funny! I mean, it's so hilarious that it has to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she the person responsible for that? Are they who owe me my time, more than the director / writer? This movie moves in any way possible. There is no good dialogue, and not a nice character. And the story ... I prefer Hulk Hogan's second worst film, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred", at this rather significant level. Looks like Shakespeare almost in comparison. The end is prevented by a few minutes of outtakes, and it's still under 80 minutes. The outtakes include casting members who laugh at the "hilarious" mistakes they made and the things that went wrong in the set of this "comedy." I'm glad to see someone laughing in some way with a link to this movie. Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing. It just goes further and further. It's really limp. I love movies so bad they are good. This is so bad is ... something, but I do not know what, and hopefully will never find out. Amanda Peet does not suck completely, and is actually the only good thing half about this wannabe movie. But that means very little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any price.
