Wait, do not tell me ... they threw the movie and kept it out. You know, the movie would have been shot in a New York alley. Probably the "Bangster Gangster." Gangster Rap, designer dress dancer, including a handkerchief that in a way has been moved from the neck to protect from dust-to-head storms. I think I had to protect my head from heat-filtering through K-Mart hats. "The rent-a-horsie ticket", apparently, provided horsi. The scene with a bedroom where the girl and the guy were talking was saying his words ... Even if he spoke. You know, watching this movie just confirms that it's not about acting ... about its appearance and money. It could not have been too much of that if this movie is concerned. Overall, I think this movie will come down as the worst movie ever made. Just another thing, where was Ice T? Has he eventually managed to go to Oprah?
