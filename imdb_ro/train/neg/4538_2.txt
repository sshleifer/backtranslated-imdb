In fact, I went to see this movie in a theater, but what a total waste of time and money! Revenge, I'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this sticky scenario. Some friends told me to go and see this movie because James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. He liked the book very much, so the movie had to be perfect. Well, maybe I had my hopes a little too big, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet, to a point that I actually left, I had to vomit and the worst of all will be a sequel! Make the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
