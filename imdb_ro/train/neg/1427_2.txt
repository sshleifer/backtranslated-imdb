The British scraper series, which was "full of voice" from "ordinary" people in the mouths of "cute" fantasy creatures, had at least the advantage of seemingly droll non-British viewers and the rarely cultivated kind of humor you could not to receive the American Television. Someone made the mistake of putting it on US television. A kind of sad American miserable of the sublime British COUPLING who died in a month on NBC when the same basic scenarios did not "translate" from English into English into English, which seemed to be a career and a culture (and only one boring BIT) in England, it happens in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as simply puppet boredom. There is no line of plot, no character and after one and a half watched episode (out of the three eventually broadcast), no reason to suffer through more. The only positive thing to say about the new summer series and the merciless race it took was that the noise is at least professional and comes as a set for the worst show in the CBS program, "New Adventures of the Old Christine" (or " how to be a HORRIBLE mother - or a person - in an endless and non-functional lesson "), the children who wanted to stay over their bedtime, ran happily to bed rather than sit down through this show, and adults could wait until 21 o'clock when "Two and a Half Men" and "How I Met Your Mother" (the real writing of quality).
