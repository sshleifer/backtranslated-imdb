It seems to me that some of the films that were forbidden during the history of cinema were really very important and very good movies. I would like to argue that, instead of forbidding challenging, controversial films, censors should consider banning such bad movies that they pose a threat to your intelligence and your health. If they did, one of the first films to hide fast would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This movie is awful with a capital "A". It's the worst movie Burt Reynolds has ever played in ... a lot for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" in his CV! <br /> <br /> The slim story comes to us with the success of Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He was stuck in a delinquent contract with the crooked promoter, Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract asks him to do some humiliating promotion work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as dressing like a giant chicken. Shuffled in the mix are Jim Nabors, Ace's girlfriends, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a fractional brain smaller than a pea that is animated by Ace. Hal Needham, the director of this low grade garbage, was previously a stunt and made numerous films based on his expertise in organizing spectacular stunts and racing car racing. Some of these movies were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited," but with "Stroker Ace" he's getting a better career. The characters are so bad that you actually feel sorry for the actors who play them. Anderson is especially grasped with such a bad role that it makes you tooth your teeth desperately. Humor is weak and infantile throughout the year, and stunts and race sequences are unimaginable. Even withdrawals during closing credits (which are found in all of Reynolds-Needham's collaborations) are generally inoperable, which gives the impression that maybe the movie was not much fun to do. "Stroker Ace" is a considerable magnitude stinker.
