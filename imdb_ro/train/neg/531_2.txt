With a distribution list like this, I've been expecting a lot better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie in bed. The best actresses in the world can do nothing very interesting when their action is limited to sleeping and falling asleep throughout the movie. Summary of the plot says a secret is revealed to daughters, because their mother is approaching death. The thing is, never tell her daughter anything but cryptic advice to be happy. All relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that it was not necessary in the past and in the past between past and present. It seemed that the idea was either stolen from the book in the Da Vinci Code, where the device was used to enhance the suspense either from The Notebook where they used the device to create the never-ending story of the main characters of the story. However it would have been a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create anything. It was a way to try suspense in a movie that has none. I left wondering why good movies can not be written for women. It was a disappointment.
