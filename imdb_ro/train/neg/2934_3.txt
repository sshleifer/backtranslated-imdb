Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young, a stereotypical idiot idiot who works as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After getting a very lucky break, he started working on the highly respected Sharps magazine, led by a credible Jeff Bridges form in New York. It's more the Devil wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. The unpleasant interest of love is offered by Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for laughing, but they do not exactly set the fire screen with their passion. Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide whether he should forget his journalistic principles to get the material in the magazine. Of course he is finally seduced by the glamor and shine of the celebrity world, especially by the young star Sophie Maes (Transformers Megan Fox). The fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if he has ever felt similar feelings in real life with this movie and to some extent Run Fat Boy Run, one of the best comic talents in the Sea Britain being destroyed by the US. /> <br /> It's all a comedy. Come back to Simon, we can forgive and forget.
