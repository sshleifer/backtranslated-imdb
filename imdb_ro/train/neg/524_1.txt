"40-year-old Virgo" exists in a world I do not understand. A world in which an employee of the electronics store can tell the boss to "shut down" him and broadcast naked ass videos in the store and not be reprimanded. A world where it is very fun to be drunk and break other people's cars. A world where it seems good for a boss to harass his subordinates sexually. A world full of violent and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without fun jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the apparent choir of the spectators who liked this film. I thought each scene was like a bad night's Saturday night schedule - not too funny to start, and stretched beyond any rational thought. The chest-skin scene went FOREVER. The characters, except Carell, were a complete note. And the romantic elements have been completely invented, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. That was just blades. And we also found the totally annoying and excessive "Aquarius" sequence. I hated ugly hate this movie!
