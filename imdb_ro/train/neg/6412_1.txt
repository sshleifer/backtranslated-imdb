I just came back from the movie and am totally amazed. This film is an absolute mockery for all mankind. The theater we were in may have another 4 people. This movie was recommended and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe any normal man would like. There was NO plot PLOT at all. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about anything? This movie just goes to show why Hollywood is in such a shame. I can only look at the spiral of the Horror movie industry and chuckle. What transvestite for all the movies, this is true of all the new "horror films of adolescents" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. Everything is rubbish. Does not support this kind of wind!
