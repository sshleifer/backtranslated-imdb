I'm not sure what Diane Silver is thinking when he's making this film, but obviously he has nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel about which the film is based. summer for AP English 12, and just watched the movie. During the periodic recording and checking of the clock, we considered the chances of being hit by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear and I was forced to see the rest of the movie ... and then write a 5-paragraph essay. Wright's novel talked about very real themes, about a murderer's mind, and the psychology behind him. Silver's film turned a killer into a victim, which Wright did not want (see: "How Big It Was" 454). I will do this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness, in words of Raphael Lambert, without words, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not a challenging material. <br /> <br /> ... :: Sighs :: Now I have to write the essay.
