I saw this movie once, and I thought it was OK. Then my friends at work said, "Look again, it's better." That's how I did. And, to my surprise, it was LIGHT the second time! There is a word limit, so I'll give the ball here. <br /> <br /> - The bombing scene was so bad. Why on earth someone would expect to trigger the explosion ??? - None of the characters here is at all pleasant. Not for the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> -Ah, and the last time I checked, a car does not explode from a single gun shot, it can not burn a fire-extinguishing firepower thoroughly ... made the viewers above 3 / 10 actually watch movie ??? - The room is so unclear, I can barely tell you what's going on. This opening scene with the robot ruined my stomach, the rest of the movie was not much better. The sniper scene. The McManus Brothers (from "Saints Boondock") cast their eyes, was so stupid. First, why did the guy put the gun in which a person was shot? In addition, why would he spend a lot of time cleaning bullets, recharging, targeting and NOT being shot when there was so much chaos around him? -SAS RUNNING RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? Are soldiers ... homosexual ... ??? I did not think it sounded homophobic, but honestly, the scene was so ridiculous. - Long time for her good, but too short for the amount of material buried in it. Bigelow seems to think the more action, the better. It seems to be wrong - the movie is full of unnecessary action scenes thrown there to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know the guards are longer at 163 minutes, but at least the movie was not shot. This movie, on the other hand, makes, and for him, he feels more. The only good thing was Renner, which was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favor, jump over and do not give in hype.
