Bo Derek's debut film has been unseen for eight years? and so it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, he is basically the Ed Era of the Erotic Cinema? not that this is explicitly explicit, given that Bo (he was a very attractive sporting fan) was only 16 years old when the movie was made! John wrote and photographed it; the latter results in some decent images of the Greek island's decor against which the narrative lies? but the plot is childish and the atrocious dialogue! <br /> <br /> The character played by the male ruler Peter Hooten was raised with Bo's family: they grew up as brother and sister, but now in teenage years, the couple discover they are attracted to each other, as I said , do not expect sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing is that protagonists each have an obsession throughout the film, which is not just nonsense in themselves, but also irritating in their anxiety? Hooten wishes to transform the remote fishing community into a modern modern resort and wait for a cruise line to appear (which, of course, happens at the end); Is Derek even more nuttier? she wants the possession of an ancient antique bathroom! For recording, the couple is married to the end of the movie. Also involved in non-events are the mayor of the city and a lothario photographer who wants to make a model from Bo (and who, of course, suffers the wrath of the jealous Hooten). Occasionally, for no good reason, we are even treated to fragments from the screening of the old Hollywood classics in an outdoor movie house where the whole city gathers (among the titles shown is ENEMY PUBLIC [1931]) ! At the end of the day, while Bo's naivety is totally charming, it is not enough to compensate for the overwhelming and amateur of the film.
