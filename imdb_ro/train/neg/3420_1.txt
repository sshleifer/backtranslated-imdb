I saw this movie the first time at twelve o'clock in the evening. It is the right time for that. I have never seen a movie that was actually more predictable and more dirty with stereotypes. If you want to watch a thrilling action movie, do not watch it because you may lose the will to live halfway. However, if you want a good laugh, please follow! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my pleasant night's pleasure. What struck me most is that any scene that would be expensive to do was copied from a Discovery documentary or from an old television special to the US Army. Moreover, I was amazed at the fact that they did not make the least effort to make the production look real. Afghanistan is, as far as I remember, nowhere near any sea, yet with one click, Deke breaks out of the sand castle of the terrorists with his jet and is taken by a submarine (perhaps Discovery). Later, in the film, Deke threw an Islamist terrorist on the wall. In the slow moving scene, you can see the long hair of the Korean bell in the street when it was destroyed by the wall. You ought to like it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer, but then you will understand why I was angry enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
