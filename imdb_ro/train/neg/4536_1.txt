This film is nothing more than a religious tract that promotes classical Hinduism and New Age occultism, dressed with Western images, to be swallowed up by those who ignore fundamental religious comparisons. The basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear both now and in the 1600's), obviously reincarnated. God is an impersonal force. The life and life of the animals are the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield tried to blend oriental mysticism with Western Christians. His attempt at syncretism may mislead or confuse those who do not seek the truth, but this film is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality. As the old Berkeley Barb announce for $ 10.00, it will show you how to start your own religion. As a famous prophet said, "Use the force of Luke."
