We left very few movies before it's over, but we could not finish this trash. This was the biggest task of racism that is trying to translate as a legitimate film from the "Birth of a Nation". Characters were just cardboard cutouts. I do not see how an actor would like their names associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to do that that garbage like that. I know that I and anyone with a brain have better things to do ... like looking at the dry paint. I want someone to make a film about interracial relationships that realistically deal with the subject. There is much more depth to this subject, the superficial rank of a bitter director like Lee.
