More than a mysterious movie with some free horror elements thrown into; mediocre global. Start with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sexual partner gets out of bed, enters the room of her child crying and killing him. Wakes. Then that person dies in a hospital, spitting blood. His alien daughter arrives and manages to contact her through her dreams (I think) and wants to find out who killed him before the body completely breaks down in the tomb. It's not too much mystery about who he did, or even how; most viewers will realize that they are long before being revealed. I'm not sure the way he was killed would really work. The elements of horror come in any case: a heavy autopsy, the recurrent dream of the man who kills the boy, a nightmare in which an egg plate turns into an eye that is then cut off and some photographs of man decomposed into both nightmares , and in his grave. I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
