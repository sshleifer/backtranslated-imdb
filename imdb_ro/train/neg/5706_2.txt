This film is akin to the thousands of "cats and mice" films that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but really describe a great class of movies.) There is the main character passionate, wise, weird, but common sense, with his attempts placed stupidly at funny comments, initially hostile but soon soaked a gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable "useless" love story, my loved ones hostage and, of course, the evil careless adversary with her brutal servants. Everyone has already seen many of these movies, and "National Treasure" is like any of them, with only a little modified packaging. Every return of the story was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I am not the clearest instrument of the shed). I'm tired enough to feel crazy for the money after going out of the theater from a Hollywood movie and if you've ever felt that, listen to my warning; stay away from this movie.
