Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria), look at the last minute arrangements for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding, and Kate is in a frenzy, worrying about food appeals. But horror horror, the "angel" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, is without wings. In a struggle that followed with the sculptor, the heavy "ice" woman falls on Kate and sends it on. A year later, Henry's sister arranges a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to meet other ladies and go ahead. However, the awesome environment, Ashley (Lake Bell), becomes interested in Henry himself, much to his catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate turns to the other side to create a disaster for Ashley because he does not intend to let another woman take his hands on Henry. Can anything be done to get Kate back to heaven forever? This is a romantic, romantic comedy, one of the most serious that this fan has ever seen. No, it's not distributed because it's trying to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny, while the fiancé and Bell has an unusual style and humor that is just as infectious. Biggs, a fun spy, is wasted. As for Rudd, a very talented performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless, please), he tries the hardest of all and in fact is the main reason to see this clunker. Its charm, looks and easy to make a long way in making the movie supportive. But nothing can turn a mindless scenario and a terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So if you're a fan of romantic comedy paint, think long and hard before breaking your money for it. There were really free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near death experience for those who love the cinema of love and laughter.
