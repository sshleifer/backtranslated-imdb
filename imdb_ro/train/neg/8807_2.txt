I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a 28-day zombie movie or something like that ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens, except for a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This parcel gives rise to a series of disgusting cannibalism scenes ... <br /> <br /> Very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ---- ---
