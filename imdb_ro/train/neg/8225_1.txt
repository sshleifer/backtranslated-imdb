I DO NOT PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A FILM. We have lost time and money on this and are quite p ** sed about it. The actor is comparable to high school songs. The scenario is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes after the end (which I think I should be rewarded for touching) I had a headache from all the cries crying and crying the five faces. Most of the violence is (rather rarely a movie nowadays) suggested rather than graphically, but I found the characters so irritating that I wanted to see them and indeed, every person involved in making this piece of dying dies in the more horrible possible ways. <br /> <br /> I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from your poor 100 minutes. Do not do it.
