The mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat blade film. Why did I watch movies like this when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one to punish myself by looking at a terrible movie after another. I do not know, I think I need a hobby during adolescence. A teenage defeat (rainbow harvest) looks for consolation in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the horrible power this ancient mirror has and uses it to take revenge against those who have wronged her. Movies like these, the energy giver has an ugly side effect. This changes her inside and out, whether she likes it or not. A disaster of a film that, for some reason, was restored on DD. a few years ago. I do not know why. He should have left it on the shelf and gathered dust. People love this enemy film for a reason. If you want, I'd like to know why. Until then I do not like this movie and I have no reason to ever see it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
