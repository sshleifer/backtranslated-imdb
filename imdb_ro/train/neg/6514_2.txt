The film tries to be a mockumentary - shot in documentary form, but with many parts obviously described - but fails to give the public any character to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film is about finding a real love in Los Angeles, but it's nothing but an uninteresting look at an amateur director who is trying to make his first "big movie."
