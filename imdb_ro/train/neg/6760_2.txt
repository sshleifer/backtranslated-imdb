Renowned writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as editor of the magazine in Baltimore, Maryland. However, interruptions, delusions and rejections threaten to counteract their efforts. He would also like to rekindle the love with an old grandmother, a significantly erroneous perspective, as it turns out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of Edgar Allen Poe's last mysterious days. Redfield uses a lot of black and white photos, color and trick to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) is doing well, relatively speaking. It is not enough.
