Oddly, almost all commentators are very positive about this movie. Is it because it's since 1975 and does Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive them from time to time very poor ways of acting and childhood storytelling? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is because some people become sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, the filmmakers do not assume that the audience read the book). Or is it because I am subconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors are trying to behave like their French counterparts?
