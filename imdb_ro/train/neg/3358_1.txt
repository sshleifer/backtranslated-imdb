Hunting. A remake, of course. The original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that improved over time. Compared to this remake of 1999, it's a classic. There is no evolution of the characters here, just cartoons (bitch, authoritarian brain, "We'll get out of here," colleague, a witch so sensitive). But seeing how the special effect benches were "the star", I think the characters you can empathize are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. They cheered cherubs, elastic doors, irritating the dead children who can not speak clearly ... and a healthy idiotic ending that makes it most generous to give you a new age-old butterfly and rainbow age. I take my oral Skittles, thank you. Bruce Dern, you liked the Cowboys. Stop.
