It makes me sad to film a movie with a lot of favorite actors, locations and genres, that is, Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and the political thriller, but "The Sentinel" really hits a bit. It's as if he had a great idea in front of him, signed a proper distribution and made some great pictures of the city and then made a vacation, leaving the rest of the crew to improvise the rest. And I'd like to come up with another gentle interpretation from Basinger (not only that I feel it's one of Hollywood's worst actors, but it's still more than a decade later that she was the only one and certainly only a bad actor in the movie, to win an Oscar for "LA Confidential"). But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer on 24, plays Jack again. I miss the old days of "Time To Kill" or "Some Good People". Douglas definitely took a break to act and called on this phone. Plot: Someone, a Traitor of the Secret Service, wants the president to die and Douglas is (accidentally) framed. Will anyone believe it? In fact, no spoiler here: how soon they came with that half subplot, it ends before you know that. And why did somebody (s) want the dead president? Is this still to be revealed? Too many plot holes, too many doors open and never closed and too predictable The "Sentinel" is. If you only see a movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but whoever is familiar with these types of movies or even saw an episode of "The Law and Order" that you will know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinema was good, and despite the fact that Sutherland again played Jack, he still managed to do it.
