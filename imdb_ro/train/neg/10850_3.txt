This movie has a few things going to really bats on it. Having Dani Filth as the lead actor will automatically make some people like this movie. Of course, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack of this movie long before watching it. Dani Filth is a very well-known character and makes an edge. The independent movie shooting style is great for the scary factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. To have a low budget, the special effects were not bad either. The ways people died were very creative and nightmare. Now, on the contrary. There is very little talk throughout this film, making it very little in terms of character development. It's hard to worry about the life of clear, static characters. When he spoke a little, the F bomb was abundant, appearing in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems that a presiding boy writes this and thinks it's cold to include the whole language. The story, what I could do from it, was pretty good, though many parts are left tangled and the lack of conversation leaves someone who often asks what is happening. Finally, Cradle of Fear is like a porn for those who love sex and violence, but like a porn that tries to shoot a story, it does not work well. Hire it, though, if you are a morbid person looking for your blood and appetite.
