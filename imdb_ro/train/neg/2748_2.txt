this movie gets only a second star because I work in the city center and liked to see it was destroyed. the effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and yet absolutely horrible, makes a massive waste of money. I hired her, so I will not complain much about what I paid, but it's been a while that I will never come back again. plot holes abound. terror that acts everywhere. I do not recommend to give up time to watch this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to look at it, run away. I can not stress how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell came the second dragon? why did not it appear earlier? how did they have rocket launchers on the dinosaurs 500 years ago?
