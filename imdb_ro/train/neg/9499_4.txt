I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing of substance was discussed. It seemed to have cheated ideas and offered nothing new. The movie did not have a miracle or a love story or something that really would have led to science. Most scientists have appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes odd. A woman said that her prizes do not matter much, only children who were helped. She said that after a 10-minute scene in which she explained all her awards. Playing "humble scientist" is not it? "I have dances in my head," another said. I do not see how something explains us. It did not cover the significant effects of science on our culture. The science policy has just been reached. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad blow for a 10-14 year old woman. Besides, I felt it was boring and unrealized. 4/10
