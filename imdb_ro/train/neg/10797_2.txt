It was a nice guy playing Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was hit by his rims were corny, these lines were bad a stupid child crying over bad actin bad father, bad casting, special bad effects coming next? this movie sucks Prolly did not make $ 20 he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a wine cellar like a damp food stamp ... Yeah, you got it, a bad rhyming dick who can not play, in a stupid film with horrible special effects. Oh, and he fucks like hell. I will not even continue. Let's just say it belongs to the category "so bad, weird." Watch her with your friends and laugh good. But do not expect anything spectacular.
