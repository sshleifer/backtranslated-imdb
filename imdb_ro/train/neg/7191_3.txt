She saw her yesterday night at Midnight Slam at the Montreal Film Festival. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly overwhelmed by IMDb fans. The act was just regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot is not considered considerably: the film refers to those college degrees and to the games they play, making joking calls (7/5/5). In addition, you can anticipate the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like joking calls and a slash with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice throughout the movie, you might like it. If not, this movie is not worth it.
