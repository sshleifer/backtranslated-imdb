Just too many incidents of violence. The movie goes from one scene to another, and in almost every violence it bursts. Now I'm not one who is shocked by violence. , and for me a movie without a fight has something missing. But, please, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we are again." There are some signs of a story between violent scenes, but two-thirds of the way through the movie that we stopped completely and could not wait for the end. If this is the best filmmakers they can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable life, such as shoes or mail delivery.
