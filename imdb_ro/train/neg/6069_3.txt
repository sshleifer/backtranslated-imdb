Never slow down to wondering how you can get an excellent actor and make him lose in a movie like this one. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is just as similar to the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but he can not resist when the actors make the same skein in more than one movie. I think it's getting old, and that's the case here. There is nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story was told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his belief looks in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than fun. However, because De Niro is in this movie, this makes a draw if you are a fan) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro at the highest level, see "Midnight Escape", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land," or even go back and check out "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II." Do not waste your time with this move. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
