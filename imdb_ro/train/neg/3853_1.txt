I think Jason Lee has a huge potential, but it was a WRONG vehicle in which he tried to burst like a star. The story is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I think for relief, because, retrospectively, there were quite lame jokes. I got frightened of Fletch's future and I was convinced that the movie was wrong, not Lee. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend you watch the movie photos on this site to find out what the situation is, instead of this movie. Save your time. 1 star.
