How did this movie become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to start why this movie sucks too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the action of some characters. The movie was too bright, she should have done something with lighting, for example. making the environment darker. Creating dead characters made this film look like a horror film from 1970. This is 2006! People are not scared of other people wearing hard makeup. Most horror scenes are taken from other horror films in Hollywood or Asia. Ripta≈£i you! That's why they do not watch movies with tagalog. The only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from the Ring and improvise the fact that instead of a girl who comes out of the TV now comes from the window next to the door? No matter how you put it, it's still stopped. If you want a great horror movie, watch the best horror film of 50 on this site.
