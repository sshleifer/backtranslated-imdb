This movie is very bad. Maybe it's rough, but it is. It really is. Poor scripture, every vampire clich√© in the book is used and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... namely Dracula. There have been some truly brilliant films about Dracula / vampires in the past, but this does not even reach the "terrible" slot. Take a selection of people who seem to have left the teen-slasher moved, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a tonic full of religious / surreal dreams ... and you get a confused disorder of a movie - Dracula 2000. I I really can not find good things to say about this movie, as if it were not bad enough that it was done first, it seems that they made Johnny Lee Miller have an English accent ... is the problem with which I hear you cry ... Well, he is English, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. Everything could also tell you the money (if you're thinking of buying it) or rent it, watch it and find out why it's as scary as the Tellytubbii. PS Although La La is pretty scary!
