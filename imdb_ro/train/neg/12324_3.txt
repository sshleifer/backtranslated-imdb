It was a breach of that garbage that we must pursue in host Bob Saget in half an hour before that. Dave Coulier just thought it was funny and almost the same show America's Funniest Home Videos, unless the hosts have a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen would have needed money, and Coulier had to go to the junk bin for his jokes. It was enough torture because they saw him mimicking Popeye and that other cartoons started going to Full House. That guy who played all practical jokes on everyone deserves to be at the end of receipt of notice of degree A. Coulier must have needed money to get them on Alannis Morisette while met.
