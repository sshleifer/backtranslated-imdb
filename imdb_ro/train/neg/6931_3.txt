A rich stupid guy around 1800 wants to visit a mental asylum nearby to see how a famous doctor cares about his patients. Despite an initial hostile response, he is soon enthusiastically invited and gave a good doctor's tour. And, as the doctor shows him, he speaks, speaks and speaks! And as he speaks, the servants run from here and there, doing nothing particularly productive. While there are some actions here and there (and some of them quite disturbing), it's amazing how loud and cerebral is everything - lifeless and energy that is weird for a horror hit. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses as one gets tiring. The longer your tour continues, the worse it becomes until you eventually realize that the detainees have taken over the hospital and tortured the guards. Again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places - especially when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony takes place or people are just wandering about the set. Only when the asylum workers are in a cell of detention, starving, the movie has a real impact. Considering this plot, it's hard to imagine that it's boring, but the people who made this inexpensive movie have it! Now with the same plot and action and direction, this film was an exciting and valuable film. You know, now that I think about it, it was the plot of one of the episodes in the original Star Trek TV show! You know, the one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe," and Kirk and Spock are detained by this madman and his crazy followers. A final note: The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene so it is warned - it's not for children. In fact, given how unimportant the film is, it's not for anyone! However, with the version included in "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", printing is so incredibly bad that it's hard to see all of this meat because printing is so dark.
