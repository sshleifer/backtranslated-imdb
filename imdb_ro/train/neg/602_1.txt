Another example of the total loss of UK lottery money. Just as this commercial movie has demonstrated. The Cinematographic Council, which funded this miserable garbage, should be blocked on one of London's London Underground stations because it allowed this clich√©d, a discrete specimen to commit to filming, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror films the director saw and felt good to mimic, especially Deathline. Among his many sins is the obvious failure to make the main character sympathetic from the distance to the last minute. It's a little too late then! Of course, all those directors of development at the UK Film Council could have noticed this at the scenario scene. Add to this terrible action and the ridiculous look of the creature and get a prime example of how not to be scared.
