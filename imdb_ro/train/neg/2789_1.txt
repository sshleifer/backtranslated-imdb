Savage Island (2003) is a lame film. It's more like a home movie shot with minimal illumination and an angry adventure. Not only the story and the script have been miserable. I do not know why this movie was made. I've seen a lot of movies in my time and those I really like are movies that make me angry. That made my blood boil. The situations were harmless at best. If I made such a movie, it would have been a short one. Indeed, because those wooden "idjits" would not have been in the picture. Do not be fooled by D.V.D. I am a supervisor passionate about a bad movie theater. But this movie is virtually undiscovered. I'm not bothering that the movies are shot on D.V. but if you do that, you will make the movie a pleasant, not a tired of horror horror films (sans Wrong Turn). I do not have to recommend this disk loss. If you encounter this in the rental shop, go through. Movies that make you angry really become automatic 1.
