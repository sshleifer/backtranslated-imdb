Alexandra Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. Not only was he a remake of a classic horror film, but he was pretty good. So, almost a year later, we are treated to continue this remake. While the original writer Wes Craven has returned as producer and co-scriptwriter, this film fails to rise to the original level and remake. A group of military trainees stops in the desert to check out some scientists and finds they are different from the mutant family in the first film (at least those who remain plus new ones). There is a lot of gore to be here. What bothers me about this film is the total lack of characterization. The visitor does not give birth to what happens to any of these people because we did not get into them. Even the mutants have been the last time this time, nothing. Gore for the sake of the gore is useless. There must be a reason for this to happen to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is the last time with rape scenes in movies? Here we have another without a real reason. We hope this is a set of hills that will not be visited anymore.
