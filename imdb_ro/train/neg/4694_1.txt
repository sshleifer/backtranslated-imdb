I was interested in the Big Rig title and description during my visit to the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get rid of chairs as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is made up of several "big rig" drivers who wanted to deliver goods to the United States. The characters are wonderful people, but the filmmakers have not dig deep into their complexity as humans. Instead, the story darkens as much as the maps in the movie are meant to guide, but I never do it. Most of all, we lose. We, the audience, do not go anywhere and, as in the direction of the story, we get somewhere but without direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where we are? How did we get here? The story is blurred, and the directors' intention to "humanize" a group of people whom they regard as "passed away" and "invisible" meets unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here is in the perspective of directors instead of truck drivers. The directors bring their naive assumptions about truckers and then edit the film to confirm these assumptions. Overall, the story has no tension, the movie is too long (it should have been a sketch of 15 minutes), the big question about "So what" is never answered, and the whole movie is a single piece of visible propaganda nothing no longer "illuminates" (as the directors say) the outside world about the great riggers.
