Nick Stahl's name, young cast and attractive coverage of VHS made me buy and watch this move, waiting to see a teen slash movie. What the hell! The screenplay scenario with clich√©s, dialogues and shows are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrifying? summing up, a total loss of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points. The movie begins with six characters, indeed three couples, together as a group of friends, but really very ugly, who seems to be enemies, playing a huge and meaningless game called "taboo", and each of them writing yes or no taboo problems. That is: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and their relationships. Then there is an ellipse a year later, and the same group is gathered together in a New Year party, insulting each other in a very sordid manner. But the plot and the overturning are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable that it does not deserve any extra line in my review. Just one tip: do not waste time or money on this trash, you will surely regret it. My vote is one (terrible). Title (Brazil): "Taboo" Jogando Com a Assassino "(" Taboo "Playing with the Killer")
