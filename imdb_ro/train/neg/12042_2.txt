Confessing that you had fantasies about Brad Pitt is an admission quite difficult for a heterosexual to do. But what can I tell you? Maybe that famous extra thing about which everyone talks and makes a star star. Cross the barrier. It attracts you to a sensuously and emotionally unknown territory. Brando had beaten him, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean, of course, and Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts, and recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has redefined the concept. He is the only reason to get out, get into the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and enter a theater to see "Troy". If you liked Jupiter's Darling style epics, you can enjoy it. But if not, go the same way, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
