I like to keep my short and simple comments, but this adds up a lot. You can not beat the first two of several reasons, including Chris Columbus's directorial talent. This movie had a terrible direction covered by a more terrible action. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. Difficult to stay and watch. The story was a total joke about a secret chip and the Russian terrorists in a thorough attempt to recover it. Horrible, rent one of the original trailers and enjoy! <br /> <br /> The movie was not set during Christmas as the original. Home Alone has been transformed from an excellent family comedy movie to a joke without any moral or plot!
