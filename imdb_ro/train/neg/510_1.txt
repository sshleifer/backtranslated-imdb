This is certainly one of the most serious films ever made and launched by a major studio in Hollywood. The plot is simply bad. The dialogue is written in clich√©s; you can make a lot of sentences in the script for this reason. The act is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron's. "Choreography" is stupid and totally non-erotic. He can only pity the reviewer who has seen Yvonne dance for 23 years as sex; it's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing at some Hollywood turkeys, it's for you. I bought the colorful VHS version, making the movie even worse. Yvonne of hard makeup, when colorful, she looks like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this movie. What kind of career launch.
