I got boring things here. His 5 minute pants are better than that. you know why? because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long this is. <br /> <br /> The plot is about ... eh .. the last half hour is okay the rest is boring and not funny = (I had my hopes up, the trailer made it look funny but the rhythm of this movie is pretty slow and unfortunately it's not funny A simple boring klaymen that fits each other and tries to make us laugh .. it does not work Maybe next time knox re-cutting this movie and adding more scenes good would do a lot of healing, but so far not good.
