Some have praised Atlantis: The Lost Empire as an Adventure Adventure for Adults. I do not believe that - at least not for adult thinking. This script suggests a start as a live action movie that has hit someone like the type of nonsense you can not sell to adults anymore. The "crack" of several older adventure films has been done long before (I think Dirty Dozen), but -Atlantis - is one of the worst movies for this reason. Characters are weak. Even the background that every member hits seems the best and the weirdest. A MD MD, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted to be sons, if we have not seen these before, we've seen mixes and matches earlier. The story of how a partner, Vinny, played by Don Novello (Father Guido Sarducci), has gone from flower shops to completely unconvincing demolitions. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a university student obsessed with Atlantis by Michael J. Fox, has any depth for him. Atlantis's quest for Atlantis continues with that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger giddily Milo dangling on a knee as his grandfather puts his headphones on his head. And while the characters were thinner, the best part about Atlantis was the voice talent. Commander Rourke is not losing anything to James Garner's voice. Although Rourke is a pretty military guy, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into character simply by delivering it. Garner's voice performance is the culmination. I'm sorry to say that the King of Leonard Nimoy's death is no more than mandatory. In addition, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also remarkable for one or two funny, funny lines - but I loved Father Guido Sarducci anyway. was the computer animation. The background animation, that is. Animation of the character does nothing unless it makes the characters already full and full. Besides landscapes, buildings and vehicles, he is not too impressed. The land was the worst. Some say they were hackneyed or tortured. I'm not sure about that. Any useful plot can be made with something new, with the right treatment. Shakespeare often started out from a story and a known plot and was famous just to put on a new layer of paint. So treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis obviously lacks that. I can not begin to enter all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot roll up like the thread and the ending makes no sense. To add to this, the script and animation are carved with annoying disturbance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERE ** At the very beginning, when Milo reveals that Runetic or Celtic symbols have been misinterpreted and the "Coast of Ireland" should read "The Coast of Iceland "we're starting to have problems. Scenario writers should know that the British take Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the Latin Latin Hibernia. But, more than that, he must know about the Vikings conspiracy to call Iceland's more ecological Iceland and the most impressive Greenlandic island. By making it the subject of a transliterated "wrong letter", the writers have condemned the need for a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Because this is a long time after Atlantis had to sink into a submarine cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had, it made the inscription much less reliable. The Shepherd's Journal could not be written before Atlantis sinking, or knew nothing about the cave or crystal lying "in the king's eye." Perhaps it was written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had made, as none of Leviathan had come to. How could he know more about something afterwards? And why would he write in Atlantis? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral journey can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral journey do not have to write in Atlantis. So it has to be automatic writing. Since no one can read Atlantis, it must be the spirits of crystal messages glowing to the surface. This would have made more sense. But it could also have been explained in the film: Milo was able to find the shepherd that this power called him all his life - he appeared in dreams, etc. This was to be explored in the movie. Atlanteans should simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects initially Indo-Europeans to converse in Europe, more than Romans would understand that their "c" or their day became French "ch" (pronounced as "sh" no less!) <Br / > <br /> The current Atlanteans lived before cataclysm - when they seemed to be able to read, but now they are unable to read what they used to or operate with similar machines. Mass illiteracy highlights a crucial flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. It looks like he's suspended in the air until Milo can save her. Even if life seems to be not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels, and maybe it's a combination of endless Atlantic school systems and a lack of good fiction that has made Atlantis fall illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be excused because she can not read or operate cars if she is so young when Cataclysm of Stupidity has been put in - But NEVER ** HARD ** qualifies her father for Deification !! Kashakim's madman almost wiped his people out of existence. He killed a bunch of cataclysm, stagnated progress (he was not killed here, but he watched a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if they had not been cooked in lava because Robots were not there to protect them. A pinch of blue electric power would have shattered Kashakim's resemblance when Kida tried to join his father's image in the GREAT kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Even if Milo was the only one to read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a throat book and find a page on a crystal - which he knew was a crystal and not some stylized astrologers or the "sun diagram". If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about that, he still does not explain how Rourke suffered from reading Milo as part of the book. Ripping his page - which was the ear of the dog in Rourke's hand, though Milo did not find any sign of a broken page in the book apparently - was just there to warn the viewer that "something was wrong." Unless the word "crystal" had stopped alarms in Milo's head for someone to try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just a rough preface. <br /> <br /> The "double-cross" of the crew was not a change of character. I learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie were going with Rourke from the beginning. However, "change of heart" decreases. It was a change and it had to be better motivated. It's hard to do with characters who have not been given anything from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Little as the lava flows over the dome instead of filling the rest of the area we see from the sequence. It is liquid; it will not flow over the dome until it has filled all the lower areas. End STINKS! - and it makes no sense but to calm political correctness. With the restoration of his power, Atlantis is no longer a weak power that needs wandering. Robot giant guards and blue lightning circles suggest they are less afraid of us than they could. Technology is superior to ours, and certainly in the early twentieth century. Eventually, Milo must teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their culture a little quiet, punished alone, not to send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS END ** Probably the Lost World plot and the end-of-century setting should give me a clue that this is more of a tribute to the pulp. The failures I find with the movie agree with this idea. But I am on a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes just because many Dime novels have them as well. And pulp stories are part of the "crap they can not sell to adults anyway," anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp has to grow. Raiders of the Ark Lost have not lost their pulp and have avoided so much harm. 4 out of 10 - the movie is nice, but when I think about the plot, it's getting less and less.
