Time Corridors. The movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated suicide mode. Some use guns, ropes or gas, but do you want to destroy your brain? Do not wait any longer! The corridors of time are probably one of the greatest possible mistakes: the Christian Clavier's thinking is capable of acting and bringing you fun. I do not miss the 45 francs, this poor cost me: sometimes, they have to reset their evaluation system, looking at absolute zero. This movie is worth 2/10, but only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also plays in Ronin. I think he'll hate him ...
