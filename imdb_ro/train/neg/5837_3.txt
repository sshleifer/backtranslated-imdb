I can not say I loved this movie very much. It has some fun moments, but it does not seem to be doing a job if it's a comedy or a drama. It does not really work like none. the light in tone is a drama, and the funny moments are few and far between. also does not make much sense. things seem to happen for no reason. and also is extremely convoluted. I feel like they did things while they just left. If they just took a little time explaining things, it could have been a better movie. It would be said that the end was anti climatic, but that would mean the rest of the movie was actually built on something, which did not happen. It's over, and that's it. I did not find it boring indeed, but, as I said, there's no point. I will give Winter Kills a reluctant and weak 3/10
