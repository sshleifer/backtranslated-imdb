I went to a viewing of this movie and while there were a few moments that made me laugh, I had some very important flaws. First of all, she presents herself as the humorous exploits of a divorce that tries to find love in LA. What turns into a depressing, narcissistic and unhappy story through the history of the film director's life and professional life. The banknotes clothe you very quickly and you suddenly wake up that you do not take care of the progress made by this man. It is ridiculous that the director presents himself as an extremely annoying and very wrong person and expects us to worry.
