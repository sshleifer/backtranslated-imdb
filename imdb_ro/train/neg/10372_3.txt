I liked the commentator's comment much more than I did when I saw him at a secondary theater in the early 1980s. I was impressed with the concern to create such fashionable costumes after Tenniel's drawings. But for me, the distribution was largely scattered, their personalities were swallowed by the masks, while the direction we considered to be unusually static, and the photo is cloudy. The rating at that time was a moment, which means "it's not worth it to stay even once". However, I would also jump to a chance to have a second look.
