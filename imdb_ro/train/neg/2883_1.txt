This movie is so terrible. So bad I can bear nothing but a few words. Avoid this movie at any cost, it's terrible. Nothing in the details of the offenses is properly replied. A lot of pictures of the slaughterhouse. Odd edits and edits. There is no continuity in the plot. The actress is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without considering the accuracy of the content. Camera work is not sometimes focused and always agitated. Looks like he was shot on the video. In fact, now that they have captured Dennis Rader in prison, I'd like to put the guys who made this awful movie in jail. Seriously, you do not even think about it. It would give me a negative star if I could.
