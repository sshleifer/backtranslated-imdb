SPLIT SECOND could have been a good movie. A story of a "road fury" murder, has a very young Clive Owen who offers quite good performance; BUT ... but ... Unfortunately, directors have subtracted their own film with the idiotic work of the cameras and really terrible editing. The camera jumps all over the creature in an unsuccessful attempt (to suppose) to reflect Owen's stress in business, family and traffic. What it actually does is give the viewer a headache. Since manufacturers did not take care of making a good film, just to impress each other with their idiotic photo, you should not waste your time in this travesty.
