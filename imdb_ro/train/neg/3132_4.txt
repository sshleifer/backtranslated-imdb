I have not seen such a fabulous rating on IMDb, but I went to see him anyway, because I'm a great fan of Bible-related materials. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much Indiana Jones movie, but also shows that Casper Van Dien did not see these Jones movies (but should). I think he tried everything better, but the script was bad. The music tried to be Jones. A great job, but for such a movie it seemed like too much work, as if the video did not deserve all the extraordinary music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script brought everything down. "Jokes" are old school, somewhere for 20 years; they just brought me a cynical smile on my face. There are really bad room angels, SFX looks homeless and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I like such stories), but things just did not come out. Maybe he should have put it on the paper when it was still fresh in his head. When I saw (in the first few minutes) that the movie would be one of those low-budget films, I hoped that at least "I hear" a good story, but sometimes the films just disappoint.
