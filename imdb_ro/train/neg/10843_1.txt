This may have been done for the hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen over the years. The best thing about all the DVDs would be the case! I am surprised that people have made time to do something so waste and yet to spend money, too, I'm glad I just rented. I suppose the true fans of this movie should probably be sadic and gothic to handle it without taking any CGI or other effects for this, I hope Alex Chandon taught a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a movie better in the future, that is, if he is still working. Note for buyers this is extremely disappointing, do not buy it !!!!!
