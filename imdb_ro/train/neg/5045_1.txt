The angles of the claustrophobic camera that does not help the movie: For a long time, it only faces photos where you get the feeling that the bottom half of the movie is missing (the screen is interrupted) because it looks like there are important actions on, but you can not see them . There is already too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artistic visuals. <br /> <br /> I love the arts and the unconventional work of the room. I can handle deep and slow movies. But he strives too much to be artistic and fails in my painful opinion. Nothing to attach to any of the characters, because they are not worked out well enough. To produce more characters, it takes more than just a few minutes for long girls, at least with this set of scenario + director + actors. I wonder if some of the not good actions are due to the script and the director or the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from Le You's written and directed movies for sure in the future. <br /> <br /> What annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history and someone who spent time in Shanghai.
