I can not believe I lost 80 minutes of my life watching this dreadful movie, hoping it would be better all the way, but the boy was wrong. The plot was great, the act was extremely poor and the effects were terrible. Not even the two beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However, I can not lie, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable, such as when the Asian boy says "I lost my virginity to the babysitter, so f **** stereotypes" do not waste time with this crash if u are not ready or want to have a good laugh .. maybe this way you can watch this to break this movie with some colleagues
