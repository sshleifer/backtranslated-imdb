This film lacks ... everything: story, action, surprise, ingenuity and soul. Fifteen minutes later, I looked at the screen, saying, "How can all these boys meet and feel like friends (even without a girl)?" Another fifteen minutes, I'm asking for as much Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad movie rises quietly, it's a bad head, candy for the eye is a pleasant consolation. But it was not too much! Cheated on all fronts!
