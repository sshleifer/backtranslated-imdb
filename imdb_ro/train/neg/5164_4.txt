The base ground in this movie is not bad. A lady makes her big and returns to the alma mater to be adored. But despite the good action of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. The guilt I put either on Joan Crawford or the director, or both, because her performance is just terrible. Instead of being a real person, he does a wonderful impersonation of a rafters caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares in space and has an expression "naked, I am SOOOO amazed." After just a few minutes, it became annoying. Now, of course, it's not the only Crawford movie she does not like for her performance, as she did more than a part of her - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - they certainly were better.
