In all low budget history. this movie must be one of the worst. True, there are some humorous parts of the movie, but in general, it was just terrible. I just can not understand what person did not manage to run a bunch of garbage. I mean, he has to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that deserves while in this movie is the closing of a muscle trying to bite a man's finger. It was pretty funny.
