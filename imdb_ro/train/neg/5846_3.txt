Yes, this is one of THOSE movies, so terrible, so insipid, so daring that you can not stop laughing. I have seen comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this film. The other comments give the idea pretty good. The characters are so unpleasant that you cheer up the rats, the effects are so badly made that you wonder what class elementary school art was responsible, the actor - the actor - talking about tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks. <br /> <But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why did not we get to see the rat to the end, I am rather surprised. Often, the "big one" is not displayed until the end, because the budget is limited and the good effects send so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end of the film, because movie producers were ashamed that the best thing they had was a guy running around him dressed like a wood with a dentistry from the third world. > The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After finding that the rats could not stand strong (migraines due to illness?), The main dude threw a fire alarm to send the rats to a frenzy. If you ever want to see a pair of rat waltz, while blood drips off your head like a geyser, this movie is for you. Indeed, you have to rent it and see it. But not for more than 99, OK?
