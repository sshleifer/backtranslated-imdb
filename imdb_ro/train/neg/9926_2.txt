I just watched the 30th edition of the Blazing Sets, one of my favorite moments! The TV pilot for Black Bart has gone mad. The intrigue was nonexistent, and the act was not good. Obviously, it was an attempt to take advantage of the success of Blazing Saddles and TV shows that managed to take off large films, but it would never work. Considering that for so many years, television will not even play the noise when filming the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought it could put a show on the TV with the word "N" thrown around it. On the other hand, I liked to see many familiar faces! There have been quite a few actors / actresses I have recognized from other performances over the years. I had to write all the names and make some searches. It was fun. I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
