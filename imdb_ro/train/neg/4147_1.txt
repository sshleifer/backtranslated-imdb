I'm a happy fan of terrible movies, anything cheesy and even ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to Rent Rent, and found Vampiri vs. Zombie. The name is too fun, you know that nobody in the world could get something like this, just be bad. And boy, he's stupid. After watching this terrible movie, I was literally speechless. My friend and I put him out without saying a word for a few minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words: "... dude ... What?" Yeah, I'm an enthusiastic person. It's a fast street review. There is none, not always, in the "WTF" mode. The characters; No development, forgetful. The music; Worse than porn. vampires; Their vampires? Zombies; Their zombies? <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, so bad I want to see it again. So, do yourself a favor, look at it and get Depression.
