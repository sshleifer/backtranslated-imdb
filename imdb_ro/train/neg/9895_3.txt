If this book remained faithful to the book, then we can only assume that the author ignored history. Mark Anthony has never died of the injuries he has suffered in the battle as described. He died through the death of a coward by suicide, and even then he asked the slave to do it for him. The slave chose to commit suicide instead. In the real story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the slave's great bravery and decided to copy it. But even in Mark Anthony's death he was a drunk failing and failed at his own suicide attempt. He cried out for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She dragged her bed over the ropes, and Mark Anthony died a while later. If you want history not to watch this movie. If you want to have romantic fun, then you will probably enjoy it!
