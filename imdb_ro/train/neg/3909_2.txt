When I found out that there was a movie that had both my favorite actresses Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard fall after seeing this movie blades and I still have bruises. Jeremy Irons (an actor I still admire even after this disappointment), the plays were terrible. He treated his family as nonsense, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not approach or sympathize with any of the characters and I'm not bored at all, but sexual scenes were really useless or could have been healed. Wynona and Antonio's characters could have been developed much more and their story could have been more passionate. And what was the character of Meryl and his "mystical powers"? Why did not they get in this more? This movie had a lot of dead and the bottom line is that this is a really bad movie and there was a lot of lost talent here.
