If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that! If you have not done it and you want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie because it is in order in the worst case. So if you are really bored, go and rent it. If you want to know how it is, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is committed to working on a huge cruise ship with some models of Ms Universe and five other people. Adam does not like a passenger getting all the kids and trying to take the jokes jolly. BUT ONE TIME! Only gets worse! You will have to rent the movie to see how bad it really is.
