This is the kind of thing that only now blooms on film eggs. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush module will make you aware that Real Men do not follow anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It would have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to say - here. The motive of the voyeur room was nothing new. Did we all forget "Thief of Bicycle" at De Sica? Or everything from Hitchcock? So, all that we receive is the extensive metaphor of the minor as Truffaut, who spends his free time "screwing his eyes" to films that destroy school discipline, is accused of plagiarism (many small thefts), and eventually escapes by the social limits to make your own film. I'm sorry ... he was there, done too many times for that to matter.
