Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depends on her. Who do the filmmakers think they are? THE ABSOLUTE MULD, THE MOST UNREALISTIC that I have seen as long as I remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to enroll you on IMDb and make sure that the rating of this movie "drops". Omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a chicken, so while she's gone, I'll really make the rhythm around my room for hours asking frantically "What did I do?" .. Jesus Heather, get over it and grow up ... and I'd like to share the same feeling for the idiot producers ... and while I'm at it, instead of this film it's a pathetic excuse for a story, maybe it would have been better to focus the plot on a mentally unstable person. .. just like the so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know that for the first time I had homosexual sex, when I left the next morning, I jumped in the sky in the middle of the streets ... honestly b * tch, get a grip ... What a jok! and please keep in mind that there are many many other flaws and horribly stupid aspects to this bump blow, but I am so sick to think even more about it. the bottom line, if you are a smart person, you will hate this movie and, if you are not a smart person, then you will love ... it is just as simple.
