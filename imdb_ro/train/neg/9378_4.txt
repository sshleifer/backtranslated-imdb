This is another production from North East Florida, shot mainly in and near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was quite surprised that the company managed to take over the main street on Fernandina Beach, as long as it was necessary to make street scenes. The movie is cute and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but it's over. Eileen Brennan overlays even more. Good for small children, or for those who like puff in high doses. A 4 in the Miller-Movies formula.
