No redeeming feature, this movie is garbage. His banknotes do not start to be funny. Baby humor is pathetic, and attempts to appeal to adults just add a sticky thrust into the whole miserable pack. Meeting with my children made me feel uncomfortable about what might come next. I did not like the movie at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed having a new DVD, neither her nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing her again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King etc. receive frequent requests for replies.
