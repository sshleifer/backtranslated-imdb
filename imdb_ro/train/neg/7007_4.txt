This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is a sentimental mushroom. I suppose the production values ​​are good, decent photography, discreet direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I have not cared much for him, and this film validates this perception. No wonder he never had any kind of career outside his Star Wars movies. I will say "Buh-pa, Mark" when it sinks into deservedly obscure shade. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts totally stole the show. She showed the charm, beauty and chips that act in one interpretation. I remember seeing her recently in "Texasville" and she took note of her beauty. It's interesting to see it ten years earlier. Anyway, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie screaming at the hills.
