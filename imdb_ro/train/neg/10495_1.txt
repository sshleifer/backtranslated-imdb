I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I would not have the nerves to go just 5 meters away from a croc. But everything in this movie is bad. Furting jokes, people who eat, and skit about the president all make the film one of the worst of all time. It's a very bad movie that you have to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so minor that you will find laughter because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. I'm surprised Croc Hunter did not ask the crocodile to eat it after seeing it.
