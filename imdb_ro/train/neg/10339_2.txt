How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG in the corner beside a cathode ray tube with a large screen and a fireplace fireplace? No, he would have given back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered Camels on the couch or on the floor of his office or at the top of a flop building in downtown LA wiping the dry red crust and the oil on his face like that. Spillane wrote a trash paper, sure, but how do you do it worse? Give him a pleasant pleasure producer a blank check because he thinks any silly movie Noir will be sold at the box office, add some hot tomatoes and even screw the story of a writer like that!
