This movie started off well, I felt like watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Much to quickly start questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and did not find answers for what they were doing. All the acting was superb, but only a few scenes had short moments in which they were really funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this film to casting agents. Watch the first scenarios and then find something better, otherwise you will be completely lost in this mess. I found this in a trash in a video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the refinement of this movie, I feel like a good price.
