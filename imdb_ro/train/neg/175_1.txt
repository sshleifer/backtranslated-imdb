I watched the lake booth this afternoon on the US. Considering that this movie was made for television is interesting enough to pursue the sequel. So I signed up for tonight's broadcast and I was extremely disappointed. I knew I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be puzzled by DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable if these juxtaposed digital photos were not coming from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be linked to these photos, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE LAST LONG A SPOILER !!!!) Opening in the Lake Cabin was acceptable, but the opening that ends in the continuous is ridiculous. I can only introduce you The return of the cabin return by the Lake that can be watched is if the movie was shown against nothing but infomercials at 4 am.
