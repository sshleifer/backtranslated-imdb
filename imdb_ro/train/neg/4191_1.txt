I have seen a horror movement in my time, all absurdly bad, but no one gets into the depths that this piece of garbage collides. This movie made me nervous and nervous when I watched him, trying to wrap my head around what was about this movie. Now, after seeing it, I understand - in a way - what's happening and why, but the movie itself is too confusing to be enjoyable when you watch it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of graceful violence, the only one that shows a wonderful understanding of its characters ("The highway belongs to me ... ME!") And enough nudity to distract us enough of the "plot", but still you let this film feel alone and take advantage of it as a puppy that is no longer wanted and is left in a box next to the road. Blech.
