To be honest, this movie is another of a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called "horror masters" are just terrible about their sub-par with their ridiculous story lines ... In addition to Ron Perlman, anyone else in this movie can not act to save his life ... the gunfire sounded like someone would play Bop-it under the boom mike or something like that and it seemed complete unrealistic ... overall, this movie is just as scary as Home Singer ... the only good masters are Burns of cigarettes, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night knowing they ruined the genre which some of them actually understood. .
