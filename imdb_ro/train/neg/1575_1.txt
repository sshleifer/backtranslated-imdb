This movie is so bad that it hurts. The car makes 30 mph when it should go 100 ... the change lever that is locked (in Park!), The assistant driving for almost 2 hours with the mobile phone on his shoulder ... can not any of the 2 morons I'm taking this phone? There's nothing credible about that crap. I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like that!
