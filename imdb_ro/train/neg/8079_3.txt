Another interesting movie and some great special effects that fall directly into the trash. Direction and boring performance (except the wonderful Annabel Schofield, who is more cute than a brunette and probably deserves better material and Charlton Heston), earns the rating of a true stinker. It's amazing to see Heston perform his performances and show how bad this movie is. He even plays in a sub-plot that only interested me to see how he was tied back to the main line of the movie. The way they came to solve the problem was that they did not. It just drops from the bottom. Do not waste time with this.
