The genre of volleyball is somewhat forgotten by most writers. Fortunately, the highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best ever volleyball movie (rated below than Side Out and better than, okay, umm). Nevertheless, do not let you decorate the cover of this movie. Kill Shot plays in the stars and comes Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using such high-tech gadgets as a less powerful computer than my Gameboy, Koji is able to help the FBI agents in pursuing a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short-haired Denise Richards, a gay black and an angry and angry girl, Koji carries this film on her own. Any fan of movies, such as The Matrix or Hackers, will definitely love Kill Shot.
