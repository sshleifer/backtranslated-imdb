This "film" tries to follow the kind of low pocket pocket movies that have proven to be very effective and successful. This does not work well. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "awards" this piece of garbage has been plastered on the cover ..... makes you wonder what these critics have done when they filed it. .. /> The words fail to describe how absolutely horrible this movie is. Really, it's BEST. I watched her in 20 minutes flat, almost continuously ahead. <br /> <br /> From garbage light to terrible direction, grained images at removable sound and, of course, let's not forget about ABYSMAL's action, it was a total and totally pathetic piece of so-called film production. Seriously, there are no ransom qualities - anyway. Save your money and watch a decent budget horror movement, there's a lot there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name just a few. Avoid this garbage at any cost. Do not waste money or time on this piece of garbage claiming to be a real movie. Take note of all the other comments! You have been warned!
