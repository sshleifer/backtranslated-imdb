It's really bad about a movie. My buddy rented it because, in fact, he's an idiot. But again, I must be an idiot too, because I looked at everything I wanted! The actors were on par with the high school dragons who think it's happening. The only place they will go to is back to the waiting tables at Luby. All I could imagine while watching this "jewel" was how it was made. I mean, a "screenwriter" actually believed that this premise was fresh, original and profitable. Then a madman with money believed in the script so much that he decided to sell some money with the misconception of birth that he would return to it. Actors were distributed, locations researched, makeup artists engaged, fresh computer animators from the Al Collins Graphic Design School, and this turd began to form. things I hated about this movement, but the only thing I was most crazy about was the overworking of music. Every minute of this movie was scored. There was only one break in music. And sometimes it was mixed more than dialogue, not that you missed a vital point of plot or something else. Once it's over, we decided to look at Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel, then going to a BMW 740il. You could not get two opposite films in terms of quality.
