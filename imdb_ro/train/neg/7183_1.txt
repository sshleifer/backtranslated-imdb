This is the most serious adaptation of a classic story we've ever seen. They unnecessarily modernize and some points are actually just sick. The songs rarely move along the story. Apparently they are thrown at random. Marley's flying scene is useless and ridiculous. It's not just one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's certainly the worst music I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's probably considered just a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. Just because the original story was classic does not mean there is a cheap adaptation.
