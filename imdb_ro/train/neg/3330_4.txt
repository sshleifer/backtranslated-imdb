This film presents o.k. score and poor performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. Start-and-end credits show together with most actors and "special effects" that this is a low-budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in another mad scientist, in horror / comedy or in low budget films. It is not special for any nude scene lover or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are not at all enthusiastic. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one-line summary.
