Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that every joke must be followed by an insult to people in the crowd who do not laugh. If there is someone who is unsafe, he is a comedian who will not be silent from his audience. Then again, perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he does not lose his free horse speech. If you want to be funny, make a joke, it does not explain all the reasons why you save the American way with your failed attempts to generate laughter. Hmm ... actually .... The worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he replaces some ethnic jabs for legitimate humor. Avoid this as the plague.
