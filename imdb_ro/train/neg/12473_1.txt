This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, all about him is weak and incoherent. The act is absurd, the costumes even crummy and the story is nonexistent. This sword and the adventure film of poverty was meant to capture some of the successes that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" liked but did not give us any reason to follow them. The character of the lead is warm and boring, he can not even fight the sword and the sword is from the sixteenth century. All sequences of action are so lethal and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the orbiting music dating whenever a horse rides. You do not even bother with these crap.
