This is truly a new low in entertainment. Even if there are more bad movies. In the genre of Gangster / Drug scene it's hard to have a compelling story (these films do not mean that Sebastian's motives could not be more (then this movie is not.) Of course Tristan is retired from his family, but why was again - what is the agreement with his father once again that he must ask permission to come to his age - an interesting picture, though to ask for the lack and need of rebellious behavior of children in the upper family. Even if there is the potential to judge by returning to chance, it's not already down and out, why does it happen again? So there are some interesting questions brought here for a drama solid social criticism (but again, this film is not because of focusing on "cold" production techniques and special effects and characters a moment to reflect and often forcing the story along in which they want to be and do not pay attention to letting the story of breathing and evolve naturally.) It wants to be a drama for not glorifying the abuse of substance and violence (it would be politically incorrect these days, right?) , but, on the other hand, is nothing but a cinematic action movie (as many as there) actors and Vinnie Jones, who manages not to completely destroy what is left of his reputation by doing what always do it. So, all in all ... just ... I can not recommend it. br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
