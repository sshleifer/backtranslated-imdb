This is one of those films that is more interesting to follow from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I make my assessments according to how much I enjoyed or am entertained by the film, so I gave it 4. If I had appreciated it as an academic film, however, it would get 10. <br /> <It is filmed in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound and reality effect. It is meant to transmit dissociated memory and mind fragmentation and is interesting in these respects. However, the film has a lot of disgusting elements because we did not find everything that we entertained. In general, they are just disturbing. It also has very interesting pictures and some interesting concepts, but some character relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. Overall, this movie will either appeal to you or it will not be. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it was not a good watch and I probably will not return to it the second time. 4/10 if you look for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
