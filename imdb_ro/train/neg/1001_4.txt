I hired this on DVD and I feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious in DVD comments. It's not a bad movie, but it's one of those movies that desperately wants to be a profound comment on human nature, not realizing that her story is basically a genre. In addition, it is quite simplistic about the issue in many ways, and character behavior is often confident. I would say a movie that would take something if you do not have too much movie / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comic stripes). Otherwise, his point of view was made before and with more art. And that comes to the big problem, that it does not have much cinematic interest in addition to this point. He concludes a pretty bland film that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and convincing and that it will not really pay.
