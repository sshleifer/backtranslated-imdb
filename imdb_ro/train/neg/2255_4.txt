Was this bad movie? Yes. Did this movie deepen? Not. Character development? Not. Frequent questions? Not. It was simply a movie about a very fictional Springer show. Shows the length that some will go to take cups on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is ... well ... GORGEOUS! This movie was not so much a "breakthrough" movie, but rather it was destined for life in a trailer park (we live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everybody sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by the boys, and all the boys take it on the Ford '66 stairs (exaggerated, of course, but that's the image everyone sees when you say "the trailer park") . Some people over-analyze films (case-in-point: weird Star Trek). I watch movies exclusively for entertainment value; not to point out that the girl wears a different shirt in a different scene (read "Goofs" about Connie's shirt, maybe it would have been better?) Of course, but it was funny.
