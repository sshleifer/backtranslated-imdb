Well, how was it to be the promotional "Lordi Motion Picture" promoter? I mean, I realized that when the dinosaur costume appeared, and until the lead singer appeared, I felt "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for me ... even though I hate that song. The "dark flower" refers to a young Austrian young woman who is being snatched from the hospital by her protective father when they and the other people in that lift are momentarily caught ... When they get to their floor it's a a big surprise to find that there is no one else around. The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to pursue them for no apparent reason ... They go through the hallways and stairs, meeting all the members of the heavy metal band in their extraordinary shock - Costumes not surprisingly, except for the stupid act, the lack of gore / nudity and the extremely shameful promotional mark, reminding me very much of KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park. Yeah, do you remember that lob? I wish I did not ... I'd recommend you avoid all these Ghost House movies as a mushroom and do not listen to Lordi since I'm a GWO band!
