Many people say this show is for children only. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I first looked at this show. It was disgusting for me. I talked to other kids about this and, of course, about other shows and I know what? This was the disguise measure, whenever we wanted to accentuate something dissatisfaction (whether on television or anything else), I said "Uh, like the Power Rangers" and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before I visited this site I could not imagine that there are actually MMPR fans. It was so strange I decided to follow him again and try to understand why he likes it. I did not like this view. But I realized: maybe I do not have enough imagination? May. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate me more than 1 star.
