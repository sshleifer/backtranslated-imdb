A doctor who is trying to complete a transplant medical dream is secretly experimenting the hospital corpses with a different success. His final final comes when he loves his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he saves him from a burning vehicle. I was looking for cheese, and with this premise I thought I found it. He has everything that hunts bad movie hunters - breast and brain surgery, surgeons who go with bright white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always like to see the wheels of the car passengers), clarinet stripe music and one of the most long death scenes in film history. But, unfortunately, these bad moments-which-are-good can not go beyond the too-bad-pussy. Jan in my panic bothered me, her monologues droning in a hoarse whisper, somewhat less than the bad laugh and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian coffee and 2 DD batteries. I could not even have had fun with Dr. Bill's Bill. Usually such a bacon makes these films to be seen in my opinion, in this case I'm bored with it. The best part of the film, in my opinion, was the 1960s version of "body shopping" I even thought about at the same time. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on it - there are better movies out there to entertain your sense of sick humor.
