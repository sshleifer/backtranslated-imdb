The producers made a great mistake to chase Mark Lester, who could not play or sing in the lead role. Besides the very bad actor, all of Lester's songs had to be called by a girl. I do not know why they threw it at all, because there were so many boys who could have played the infinitely better role and made their own songs. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who only needed to be 16. The current West End version is much better than the movie in any way. Ross McCormack is the best Dodgy Artful of all time and is certainly much better than Jack Wild ever was. Clearly, the award for this old music Oscar was awarded after the tumultuous events of 1968.
