"Cavemen" has exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically, here's the show: Cavemen are an alternative race, they face prejudices, etc. Probably the most stupid idea ever created; almost is worthy of prison for writers. A show included the stone fish entering a club, trying to raise girls, and then nothing else happened. It was a reminiscence to listen to a 22-minute dialogue with Andy Rooney, followed by the death of roasting knives through cat cannibals. For those who did not see this show, here's an example of dialogue: "You're sure you're fine when you're out with a caveman." "Yes, it's good, I've had 10 thousand!" Hilar ... Probably the best writing I've ever seen. 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup, tackling difficult social problems ... Sounds like a night of entertainment. I also like how bad the ideas are that they are being recruited to make a sitcom from auto insurance ads. I wonder if they will make the next Gecko so I can have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I'd even say it's worse than Viva Laughlin. At least "Viva Laughlin" was destroyed by something that was somewhat inspired. Expressions like this make me hope that there's a comet out there somewhere on Earth. <br /> <br /> Unratable sincer ...)
