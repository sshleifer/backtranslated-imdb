The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: you see a real chaos on the stage, a producer at the edge of a nervous breakdown, the chill was director (Mickey Rourke), star temper, etc. You have seen everything before, but it is well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time, the movie repeats: the same ten minutes several times. No climax, no dramatic evolution, no good action, not even bad action, just goes further and further. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his feminist career in a scene where reality and fiction come together. In total, it means 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
