I really want that when you make a comedy, people try to make it funny. This is a movie you can spend, but nothing is special. Once you've seen it, you'll say it's okay. It was not boring to look, but he did not give the public laughing laughs. Entertainment should mean you get something more than o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie" but instead failed. I gave 1 out of 10.
