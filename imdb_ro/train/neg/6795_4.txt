Comeback starts looking promising, with a brutal death scene of a murderer-wearing mask. The mask itself is pretty cool and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990 Granny. Since then, the film has been mostly boring. We have several deaths, which are good again, but they are not enough. The reason why deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and it would have worked well if it had not been so boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this if you are not a tough collector - it is not enough to make even an average shot.
