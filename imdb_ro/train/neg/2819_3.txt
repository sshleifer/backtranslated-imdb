Marchet De Sade, Egypt, the old Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and nudity, killing and chaos ... on paper The night terrors of Tobe Hopper sound like it should have been at least a fun fun, . Is not. It's a smaller, incoherent plot that does not bring fun. In essence, there is no plot beyond some vague things about a cult following the work of De Sade, who, for some unclear reason, feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That's pretty much ... I think it has something to do with Gnostics, but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the film is a disturbing misery as the heroine is exposed to various strange, dream sequences and erotic encounters, interwoven with Englund's scenes as De Sade imprisoned in the nineteenth century, chewing the landscape. It seems that the producers are trying to do something serious, but no matter what their claims, they are buried in the heads of noise, evil acting, despairing and falsified headless heads. There are not many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always lead actress Zoe Trilling, while not very talented, appealing to various stages of film stripping, but watching Night Terror is a chore. At least I came to see the film from which the film "When You're So Criminal as I Was" appeared in the guide for Australian film ratings that was on the front of many VHS cassettes in the nineties.
