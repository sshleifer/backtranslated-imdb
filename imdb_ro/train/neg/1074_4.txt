I should not have started this movie and stopped after 3/4. I missed the really messy end. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been a lot better. It had a pleasant atmosphere, a top casting and director, good locations. But a story story baaaaaad, a stupid scenario. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - it was better than the scenario. The plot was bad - led by characters acting in unreal and unlikely ways. No one behaves so out of the Hollywood scriptures.
