Ulises is a literary teacher who arrives in a coastal city. There he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. They will start a torrid story that ends in Ulises' tragic death at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city, and lives in a tranquil silence surrounded by money. One day, Ulises' appearance will make her passion rise and act without thinking of consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors play a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film is sexual acts, which, being still well-filmed, are quite tedious because we want to see more stories of the story. It's just a bad movie of Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, with no arguments and bad characters everywhere.
