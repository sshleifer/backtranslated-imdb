Oh, what bad, bad, bad movie! Cowritten and Sylvester Stallone, which should have been enough to include too many scenes of mountaineering, vertigo, fall and scandal and a blizzard. There are two plots, both blades. One involves an unsuccessful traumatic rescue, and the other involves bad people who destroy a prey plane and kill many harmless people whenever possible. John Lithgow is usually trustworthy, perhaps depressed by the terrible horrificity of the product, cuts to shock and calls those for whom he does not care "Bostid!" in a vague approximation of the English accent. Janine Turner, who was full of light and enigmatic when playing Maggie on the Nordic Exposure, is scattered by a climber and rescue pilot. Stallone is strident and his head on the move. There are no empty lines in this. No life line.
