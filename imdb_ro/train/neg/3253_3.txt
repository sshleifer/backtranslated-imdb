I even saw China O'Brien II before I ever see China O'Brien original. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more fun! Even funny = better. If you are a fan of bad movies like me, this is a wonderful material. If, however, you are looking for any significant plot, acting or film talent, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in fast-forward stuttering. Bad lover. See him for a laugh, see him for mindless entertainment, but no matter what you do, watch him for free on TV.
