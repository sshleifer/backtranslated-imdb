Generally, I do not like Sydney Pollack movies ("The Firm" is somewhat an exception) and I was never a fan Robert Redford. Still, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" must be good because of the number of comments he has received. Although widescreen shooting is pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow makes a beautiful job as a professional sinister criminal, I found the whole business extremely disappointing. The film unquestionably releases the paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the muddled plot that does not seem to make any sense. The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings that I have ever seen the hanging spectator in the air. And what can be said about that absurd story between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch several Hitchcock movies five times in succession than staying back through this piece of waste.
