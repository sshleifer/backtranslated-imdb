After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck suffers an accelerated transformation into a human-bee creature. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, precisely because of rabies or anti-rabies drugs, considering that John is responsible for more dirty crimes. "The People Bat" by Jerry Jameson is a hell of a horrible movie. The scenario is dead and there is no gore or nudity. so boringly you will scratch your head in total mistrust after you suffer through it. Even the design of a man-boy creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmotivable. Avoid this dirty as the epidemic.2 out of 10.
