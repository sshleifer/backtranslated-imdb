A film about a bunch of filmmakers wanting to make a documentary about a new type of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including some vicious animals or monsters, I thought this could be my kind of movie ... it was not! This should be more an orientation of how not to do this! She has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene going after the main characters * rolling *, the legs are obviously waving in the air! Look ridiculous! Okay, but for a laugh. If it was just because of the lack of talent among the actors, the embarrassing and silly dialogues and the hilarious crocodile at least deserve a laugh, but it gets worse: I think people watching this movie noticed how poor it was, so, though, until the old idea of ​​"sex sells" ... In total, I totally refer, for no reason, to one of the main actresses who show her breasts to the beast. And somewhere from the beginning there is a kind of "makeup" meaningless. This is the last ingredient that makes the film for me. It's incredible how people spend time making such garbage! If you are looking for a real time loss: watch this movie!
