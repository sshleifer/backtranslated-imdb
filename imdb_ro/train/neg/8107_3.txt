This movie is pretty boring. There are fragments of naked meat around a blade attempt to keep the watcher awake, but they fail. The best thing about the film is Lena Olin - she does a mastery of her handling but Day-Lewis destroys most of her lines. Kaufman had no idea how to film this. The inconsistencies that arise between domestic problems of household / marriage and political crises are very appropriate. Character attitudes change without explanation all the time. Pretty dissociated.
