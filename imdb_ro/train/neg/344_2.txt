Allow me to be very clear about this movie. I have not watched this film because of the plot, I'm watching it for horrific sex scenes. That being said, this movie is so terrible that I am turning away from the pure joy of seeing a gruesome body in Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and tightening my eyes for the disaster of a plot. Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie had already made me realize ... you see a woman painting something on the shore of the lake in pure happiness and serenity, then a beautiful girl and wondering if she might paint beside her. When they have finished, they show each other what they have done ... and the woman has painted a vine when it comes to the lake. What kind of screw driver would make this kind of mistake? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill his teenage boyfriend, hit her with the squirrel's pole, then swims, and no city police had ever suspected her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DOES NOT HAPPEN A HAND? HIN PRINTS OF CLOTHING ARE ALL OWN PERSONS! After that, it becomes the worst, whenever Mandy is around, there is the "refreshing" sound effect played, which sounds like a cat in the right shape. It is also a great pity that Rosanna Arquette has in this film. I'm sorry she needs to stay in this super-low budget-soft porn-no brainer. The same goes for JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to play in this film. In total, 2/10.
