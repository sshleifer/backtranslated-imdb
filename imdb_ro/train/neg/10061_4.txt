"Frankenstein's Curse" fits faithfully into Mary Shelley's story for a title, which would not be so bad if the changes were not good. The tragedy of the creature that destroys Frankenstein's family was completely excised and replaced with ... nothing. The heart and moral center of the story disappeared. It does not help Frankenstein to be a convincing, odd murderer; deserves everything he receives. The land is basically a list of superficial control of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even in its own terms, this is a garbage: a gentle, confident film showing a knee-shaped creature with a bowl cutter. Because it is Hammer's first horror movie, directed by Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in horror history is sure. But it's shit.
