I love a good love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented the "Love Story," I prayed that the end would come as quickly and painless as possible and the opposite of Ali McGraw's character. <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated the mess in me in the first 15 minutes. When we find out she was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss to the poor Oliver, or if someone watching this movie would take care of it. If she did not die, her personality would probably push Oliver over the edge and then land them in the courtyard of the divorce. People love this movie, but it is one of the worst in the 1970s.
