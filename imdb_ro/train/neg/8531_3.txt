In this forgotten game, The Norma Shearer for 40 years plays a flirting socialist, girlish in Monte Carlo, caught in a confusion between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film on the boring screenplay, talky or director George Cukor, who never seems to be interested in improving his comic movie status. Mostly, however, it is the fault of Shearer, who desperately wanted to keep his "young" pieces as long as he could escape them. Unfortunately, this makes her "card lover" a bizarre monster of the vanity of an elderly woman.
