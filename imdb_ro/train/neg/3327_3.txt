Two sisters, their perverted brother and their cousin have trouble with the car. Then it happens to Dr. Hackenstein's house, which needs the parts of the body of three nude young women to use in an experiment to bring their dead lover back to life. He tells them he'll help them get home in the morning, so I spend the night. Then the good doctor goes to work in this low-budget horror comedy. It seemed to me that this is easy, fun, nothing to actually get out of your way (I hit on it Netflix instant viewing and broadcasting on the xbox 360), but I better waited for it to be for a movie purchased by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but these are still some parts that made me smile. In addition, late, great Anne Ramsey has a small part and she has always been a follow-up treatment.
