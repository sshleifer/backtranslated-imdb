I'm a great fan of science fiction in the 1950s, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teen bopper science fiction film, the director counted too much on her to carry the film. It is clear that he was working without money because the entire film is loaded with a bloated dialogue that continues and continues forever. I've never seen so much time killing in a movie. Probably, there are less than 60 seconds of "blob movie" throughout the movie, and most of the rest are people engaged in a lot of poorly developed and lasting dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but the heavens ... how could the casting believe that someone in their right mind would think they were teenagers?
