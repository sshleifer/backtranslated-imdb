I went on expecting the movie to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but the fun of the nonsense that is going on in the simple sections was also funny. That said there were many things about The Singles Ward, which were completely annoying. The whole movie was badly called and made his mouth as he listens to their very irritating voices. This lack of professionalism has only been overcome by Mormon celebrity camouflages who have no business dealings. This film will do well among Mormon, especially in college communities where there is only one salon. However, the conclusion will not give hope to the poor who are unmarried. (Only the cute girls from Singles Ward get married, the fat ones, the ugly ones do not, but all the ugly people do) Finally, we realize that the whole movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
