this movie is not good. The first was almost sucked, but it had that unreal ending to make it worthwhile to forget. It has nothing. It's zero scared, zero tension or suspense. This is not really a horror movie. does not show anything. there's no gore to talk about it. it could be almost a television, except for a bit of nudity and a little bit of violence. the act is not very good, nor do I start dialogue.as for the surprise that ends, surprise, there is not one. I suppose it could have been worse, though I do not see how. but again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I think it's a good Though it felt much more. it seems that this is the cut version of the movie. I found it at a very cheap price, but it's still not worth it. If you want a smoother graphic version, check the Anchor Bay edition. However, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unfortunate Campers gets a big deal of 1/10 from me. If you look at this movie, you will probably be a bored and unfortunate camper. If you're a true fan, you can choose Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (with the survival kit) with three discs containing the first three unlisted films and special features
