The title above is used to present the genre to his audience. The genre is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with leaving his mother to start his new job. While driving, we realize that it is not so close because the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital garden, she sees the body of a patient's death. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. Two cops come to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital, because all roads are interrupted due to unfavorable weather conditions. All their communication to the outside world is interrupted. There is no way out! In these few days, there will be more dirty crimes. Now everyone is suspecting each other. In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive aspects of the movie, of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when he leads to the hospital and his first moments in the hospital. Actions are fine. Some of them are trying too much to be mysterious and frightening. I think the final shock should have spread to the movie. What I'm saying is that it was a good twist, but instead of looking like a parody in the end, we should have realized that it comes when we see what's going on. The director had to explain it completely, which I think did not work well. Also, the most dangerous patient in the film should be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found out she's only 21 years old. This made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I will not give up this movie *.
