This film reminds me of many anti-drug movies in the 1950s and 60s, because it was made by people who obviously never experienced the social evil they warned us. Tom Hanks and his friends play a role role, but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you're just swept away in a bad fit, showing that Hanks fell for the lady in the group. quite funny but wrong. I wonder how many poor children have destroyed D & D stuff and were told that using their imagination was the way to destruction. Being a film, in particular, a specialized school, a bad action (though Hanks shows some of his talents) and relationship talks, and no one seems to have fun. It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultery, which is more serious, apparently, and asks you to let go down and do what everyone does. In spite of my 2 vote, this is worth seeing because of its unique genre, scary movies, which I personally find quite funny.
