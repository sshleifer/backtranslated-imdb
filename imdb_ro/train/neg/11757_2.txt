Hey Arnold! is a slow and boring film. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) buys all the low-priced buildings at low prices to build a gigantic mall, commercial complex and office buildings. This plot returns to many children's films from the 1960s. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is not very interesting, so his idea that the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps recall something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is around the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with Helga, whose father hopes to become richly satisfied with Shenk's shopping center. Children have to move to the city on buses, so the exciting tracking of a bus is not just silly but it highlights how this movie is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, cartoon cartoon drawings are usually very fun, and he has enough humor to appeal to adults. TV cartoons are usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold's movie, is about five times as sedentary, and a good way to put anyone, including the kids to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake until the predictable end and totally boring. If you want to send your children into a total non-offensive movie, that's all. I have the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90-minute film, the producers started with a 30-minute cartoon script and tried to extend it in 90 minutes. This Mall Story could have been covered with cartoons. We hope Arnold will bet a better writer if there ever is a sequel.
