I'm gay, another Lifetime movie, but again it's not even the worst movie in the world but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it is quite obvious who is responsible for what it is and, in general, quite predictable. Worse, some of the flashbacks have become confused and the spectator is left to wonder, "Okay, how much should I care?" One thing I liked is that the movie will show you that it's never as simple as "good guys are good and bad guys are bad," and sometimes it's bad against evil, rather than good against evil. Hadley did not do what she did from the sense of justice, she did because she felt she was entitled to a job as a family and to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia, it's simply that a victim is not always a good person. Some of them even "came," even though "it" was a painful and horrible death. "The burning bed" is an extraordinary example, but the difference is that the upset man in the "Burning House" has got exactly what it deserves. But Alicia has come in. "Some will say that he did, but others disagree, and the law in general is not. As for acting, it is a mixed bag Some do a good job, such as Mia, but others have just been indifferent to their roles - they were mostly wood or simply not convincing - the music was pretty cool, although some of the scenes are beautiful and steamy, especially if you like girl / girl action. "The film is not shot at all, but because of its bright weaknesses, the strengths are in the background, unfortunately.I heard rumors about a sequel, but given the years, I doubt that" It will happen . But I would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as bad, convincing and horrible, as people say, then I do not think she will think, "Yes, I woke up from a coma!" Hadley was responsible? Oh, good! and I want the taxes to drop! "Under no circumstances Hadley would have been in prison for a long time, even if no crime has ever happened. Anyway, worth checking at least once!
