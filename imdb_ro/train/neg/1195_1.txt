This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. Frankly, I wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to get the pain. I recommend that instead of seeing this movie, scalding yourself in acid, then you will know at least a fraction of the pain without all the scars. I had such big expectations when reading the back of the DVD, and when he first added that Jesus was watching them, I was so excited ... then by the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! Monkeys could have done a better job of editing this garbage. At least he would have dropped faeces and would have gone madly out of the garbage. It would have been better not to have seen any horror. It was not the fact that I did not make jokes, it's not only that they were not funny, but they were repeated twenty times. Apparently, something is not funny if you do not see it a million times. I do not see this in any way. People appreciated "Manos the Hands of Fate" as the worst film in the world. I've seen that and I agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is just the second worst. "Fatty Drives the Bus" is much worse. This deserves all kinds of harsh language, but I can not write here, so imagine that I swear a lot.
