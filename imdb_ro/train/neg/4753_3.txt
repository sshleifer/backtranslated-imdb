Director F.W. Murnau remained wisely with the silent film environment he knew so well to cover this story of native island life in the southern seas. Documentary style works well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful, and the daily activities of insulators are interesting to watch. The film, however, loses momentum, but when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two condemned lovers. The story never gets so interesting, despite being treated by Murnau. He won the Academy Award for Best Cinema, although the prize should have been the best scenario. You can not make credit for DP to get you in such a beautiful location.
