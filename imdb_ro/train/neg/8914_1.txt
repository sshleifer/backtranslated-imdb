I had to stop seeing this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for the demanding filmmakers) twenty minutes because it was quite mediocre and boring to inspire tangles, not to mention that soon we were close to tears over $ 3.99 we lost at Blockbuster. The act of Joanna Pacula and her gloriously accented gentle accent are terrifying enough to get someone to teeth her teeth. I knew two hours of it would be two hours too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are sung by unforgettable actors, with few talents. While we are on the theme of talent, Breuer's supreme assistant seems to have been taken out of a local acting group. Obviously, he did not learn his job. Actually, it's very terrible. All the public scenes looked in the scene, and those who strolled mechanically on the best Sundays. Stopping this movie was more satisfactory than starting it. Do not rent this terrible movie. You will be sorry to have spent your money.
