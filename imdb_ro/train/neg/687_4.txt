I'm a great fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very happy support actor) was in this movie ... So, why did not I particularly like it! Well, despite a good distribution, it is one of the poorest written and cliché "Pictures" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how hard it was writing. I knew the movie would be boring when, from time to time, at the beginning of the movie, I woke up anticipating exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! And that's not because I'm kind of a "film scientist", but because almost no imagination or effort has gone into it. In fact, it looked almost like the movie was just a long string of clichés, all together! Also, it seemed a bit irritating to me that Fred pressed Carole so badly throughout the movie and yet, true to the convention, he finally came to him. Uggh! There is more suspense in a Lassie movie ("Will people bring Timmy back or look for the rope from the break?"). Despite the very, very tired and cluttered script, there were some positive about the movie. It was pretty cool for Fred to look like a rusty luxury at the end of the movie - he was quite credible and did not seem to have eaten, shaved or slept in the days. Also, Charles Butterworth's "prattle" offered some humorous moments. But all this was not enough to make this film look different from a "B" movie. It's a shame ... it could have been a lot better.
