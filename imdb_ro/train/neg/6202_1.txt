I watched the whole movie until the shameful end, even though I felt so upset at what I saw. I felt the director screaming for attention, and the only way he could have done that was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I lived in the UK, I've come to love this country, but this film describes the young British in the worst possible way. There is nothing to say, but avoid, it will make you upset and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.
