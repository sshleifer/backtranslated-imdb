The 1980s were not very good at a major star, Charles Bronson. Starting with "Death Wish II" in 1982 and ending with this truly horrifying film in '89, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to try to get each other up in progressive thickness. "D.W. II" did not leave too much imagination about the rape and suicide of the Bronson character's daughter (a rape and assassination of his maid was also shown in disgusting detail). "10 at midnight" was a kind of heavy movie that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeems. Other films such as "The Evil that Men Do" and the rest of the "Death Wish" films from this period covered the line between big camp and high barf, with their serious representations of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) gave the blow to show a tired, aged Bronson, destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but mastery (and terrible scenes) movies that were usually destroyed, which little energy would have generated them. "Kinjite," the last of these movies, is pretty well done, but really takes cake in cinematic misfortune. In this film, Bronson: sodomizes a perverse john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes incredible xenophobic remarks among other things I have forgotten. It also describes the rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, it was out of the screen, though well involved). What did people think when they made this film? What was Bronson's thought when he decided to destroy his career with these horrific movies? For someone interested in his best movies, check out most of the films he made in the 1960s and 1970s, such as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once Upon Time in the West "," The Red Sun "," Great Escape "," Magnificent Seven "," The Rider in the Rain ", etc., etc.
