It was a terrible movie. Practically, Jane March was a North Korean Korean spy spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible for US forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, but she considers her to be Korean even though she looks whiter (I think the actress is a 1/4 or 1/8 from Southeast Asia, not at all Korean), and the teenage boy of the household begins to hate her and sleep with her. The way in which Korea and the US Army are illustrated are completely insane. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who never spent a day in Korea before this film, and had no intention of presenting a real perspective on Korea's life either for Koreans or for US GIs, their fantasies pathetic of the Asiafile, not taking into account how incredibly the movie made. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that this is a total garbage. Finally, North Korean spy honhyol is killed in an obvious way to "pay for her sins." Very bad movie with a television set for television.
