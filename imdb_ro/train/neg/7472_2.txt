This show seemed to be good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like the police series, but somewhere in production this program was great. <br /> <br /> First of all, writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but she meant, bad and bad boss. The offenses are uninteresting and gentle, and just the blade all the way. As I said above, I hate it ... In total, it was a great disappointment and really very bad ...
