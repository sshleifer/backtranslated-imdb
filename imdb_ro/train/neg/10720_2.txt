I saw this movie last week and it's stupid and mindless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are frightened and can not escape from an aged old man. They throw their torches and sink instead of trying to remove it or, spirit, burn it. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham from Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster, alias Miss Canfield from "Let Beaver" who is unhappy with marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast follows one another in the graves and awaits the cries to react and go to help. The Egyptian woman does not look bad, but does not give too much to the movie. Where is the mummy? Really just a unlearned curse. This does not have a torch on Universal Mummy movies in the smallest. Check out this movie if you need sleep, because it will dose you off.
