I was endowed with this movie because it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women, portrayed by one who fell in love with a younger man. Intriguing. NOT! I hurry to add. These women are all drawn into the extreme caricature, not very supportive of each other and conspiring and trying to bring each other down. Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could not do anything wrong in my book before seeing this, but here they are given a grim scenario and they are told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball that do not work well when women are all well-known professionals in a very small city. <br /> <br /> Smart women spend a lot of time messing up the lack of men / sex / lust in their lives. I felt that much more could have been done of her, given a decent scenario and more tension, a lesbian sub-plot did not get anywhere, and women who smoked / drunk (all three in the 1940s) were very unrealistic - - screw the baby, give him a cigarette! Correct. As I said, a shame of waste. 4 out of 10.
