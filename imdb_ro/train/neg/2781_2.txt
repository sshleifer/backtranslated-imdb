This is a film that attempts a rethink of Thai history, established in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with many Thai films I watched and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors who talk about the foolishness of Thai arts and martial arts. Well, there's nothing of that. This movie is shot entirely in English, full of Anglo actors, and has such terrible production values ​​that it laughs badly ... but not funny! Who can blame this garbage for? The actor, the dialogue and most of the sets were very bad. Some battle scenes seemed to be choreographed by the local high school theater club. The special effects were also the most bad, but a few were just the cheap patch screens on the screen that offered a great deal of cheese effect. He has an epic-style outdoor battle scene, where several thousand extras go over a field in the suit, but when we see the two armies collide in battle - HA! What a joke! The film presents some beauties. What a shame they did not show less skin. At least that would have been something for boys to appreciate. Not disturb.
