Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece." Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only by them, the producers of this film have tried to show Jeffry Dahmer's human side. Are you kidding me? Man has given a new meaning to the term "licked" well! And with all the jams and flash before I had trouble tracking the story. All the performance of Jeremy Renner was not too bad. You can catch him in "S.W.A.T." in which a former ex-cop is playing. Anyway, I would appreciate this as 1/10. He received only 1 due to Renner's performance. There are plenty of books and television documentaries that make a much better job of covering up Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
