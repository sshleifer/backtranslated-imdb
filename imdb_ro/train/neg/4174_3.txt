Whoo-boy, that was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. Granted, he was on Sci Fi, and I do not look too much at Sci Fi, but the man talks about a thin thin plot and two characters in size to the maximum. The characters were stereotypical and overwhelmed, the plot and the settlement were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more fun, the gore was useless, the special effects were horrible, and the end? Well, the only thing unpredictable about the end was when, suddenly, the tomboy becomes lesbian and begins to do it with the female vampire, which, by the way, is not really so determined given that it appears for about three seconds, where you're closer to "What the hell?" then "Man, it's hot." If this ever occurs in recharges, stop, do not see it.
