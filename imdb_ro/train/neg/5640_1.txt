I am a great fan of Willem Dafoe and I really wanted this movie (I had to get a DVD movie from Region 5)! But it's really one of the worst we've seen in quite a while. The actor (except Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (although he is not credited as a director), and do not have writing or mentoring talents. (Stick to act Willem, Giada get out of business, PLEASE!) Absolutely nothing is happening. Except for a series of completely unconvincing, entirely without credible motivation, the acts of these two people (who have just met) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I would not care less the expression NEVER is changing. And sexual scenes are really tricks. I went back to one of them twice. Yuck! They're certainly not erotic, and yet I'm the only time the movie does not make you sleep. Then he's busy rejecting you. Just terrible.
