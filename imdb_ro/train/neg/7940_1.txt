Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man with no moral qualities. He just wanted to be successful in a society where all people, politicians, business people, journalists and women are corrupt. The only king is MONEY. The Maupassant hero, Charles Forestier, is growing even bigger in society because of his seduction. He is in love with all the women who could help them in his action to climb the stage of society. At the end of the novel, he married his eldest daily daughter in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune even more, he will become a member of Parliament and later a minister. "Unnecessary" women are out of sight, but he always keeps in touch with beautiful and useful women. The image of "BEL AMI's PRIVATE BUSINESS" is a story about MORALITY. It's all, but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did they put "BEL AMI" in the title?
