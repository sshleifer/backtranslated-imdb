I think this would be a wonderful film for a true believer in the organized Christian Dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of Church and State and Good Scientology Good, it is a terrible joke! There are some well-known actors who needed work or needed to share their personal beliefs with the other heathen. I was distracted by this movie in the same way that I was distracted by "Reefer Madness". This film attempted to teach drug education through scared tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles to the threat of hell and misery for other good people who do not share their interpretations about our world. /> I was laughing at laughter and, at the same time, I was scared to figure out how many people think our society should return to the ancient times of the nineteenth century!
