"Major Payne" is a movie about a great man who makes life a living hell for his little group of boys in the navy. This movie does not have much to offer, but it offers some hilarious moments worth a watch. Do not expect this to be a memorable movie. Just wait to laugh through the film and to the detriment of others. The confrontation between Major Payne and the boy was hilarious, and that's all I can remember about the movie, except the boys who want to revenge Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie and it's probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
