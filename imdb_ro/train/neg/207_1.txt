This film is a 90-minute Ramones concert with short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is this anyway? If you are not a major Ramones fan, DO NOT repeat NOT you waste your time as I did. This is absolutely indescribable from the beginning to the end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like it in this movie. There is no plot to be found in this movie. As far as adolescent comedies are concerned, remove the bottom of the barrel with it.
