Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no leadership, except for a low-budget movie. It really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has much more presence on the screen and unfortunately he is not really the main character. Most of the time on the screen goes to Rooker faced with brick. Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5) plays his daughter and she's cute and funny, but she's written as not very intelligent and one of her bad mistakes becomes one of the main characters killed. Comedies Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just looking at what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliar on Mafia Godfather and it's hard to say whether or not the movie is a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems to be in every extremely low-motion video of the direct-to-video movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this movie made her feel like a spoof. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to say in some points. There is, of course, very little action Yakuza. <br /> <br /> The Thugs and Goons cast is threatening and well discarded. Some of these films have Thugs that look as if they were working at the local comics store or as boys at Piggly-Wiggly. Generally, this movie is very uneven. At some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then, on other points, it works like a good action movie. Then it ends. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie would miss a Zero in my humble opinion.
