Anyone who thinks this movie was not appreciated for his comic genre must smoke with the two stoners in the film. This movie is not under-rated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, because the last two movies are well written and funny. The Reunion Class is none of these things. The sad thing is that it had such potential (good distribution, good story lines), but good jokes are few and far away. Scenes that should have been fun were more annoying than funny. Types of stoner, vampire, blind face ... NO FUNNY. The only funny character was Delores (who sold his soul to the devil). The National Lampoon has made some very good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. I expected more of John Hughes.
