(Some spoilers possible) <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Dreamworks thought when they decided to shoot $ 80 million down on this extremely tired animation and animated blades. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (especially families) to see them in full swing. Well, it seemed to work for the opening weekend, made $ 26 million, approximately and made $ 38.1 million. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think audiences who came over the weekend saw the same thing that I did when I saw and spread the word. This is a major blade movie, besides animation anything else, especially the script seems to be done by a three year old. The film is about 80 minutes. long, but feels like a three-hour epic. A few points for me are, and the irritating narrative is one of them and it is so obviously written. At some point, he gets rid of some captors, and even if you see that the horse is clearly scared, it discovers the story (the tale of talented Matt Damon) to eliminate any misconceptions (which will only happen in the simplest mentalities.) < Another is Bryan Adams's constant pop, I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but he's trying to believe the audience could do 8-9 of my songs during a short film, I certainly could not. Eventually and here is a spoiler, a horse is shot by a member of the ordeal, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a river, Spirit (the center of the movie) trying to save it, but both overcome a cascade which must have at least a drop of 50 feet, later in the film near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. I know this is a movie for children, but even that small amount of realism is unacceptable. To summarize, this is really a live blade, I'm not saying kids will not enjoy it, but whoever will check their watches is waiting to end. Definitely on my Top 10 list the worst this year. - ** from 4 stars. <br /> <br />
