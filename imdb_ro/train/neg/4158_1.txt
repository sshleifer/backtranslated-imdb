This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can say honestly that I have never seen a movie worse than this one! <br /> <br /> And I never think of it! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror movies 'B.' As you can imagine .... I've been exposed to some of the worst movie industry has to offer. I want to say c'mon ... what a true horror fan would not be intrigued by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies "Screenshots of the" strigoi "who fought each other with the" nerd "danced in my head. I thought about myself ..." That's what I'm going to do <br /> <br /> This movie title it is very deceptive to say at least. There were no vampires fighting the zombies. In fact, there is no plot !!!! If you ask me what this movie means, I can honestly say I have no idea! There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no sense! At the end of this disaster ... I woke up bad for the poor souls who have invested money in this project because they have no commercial sense!
