At least the set under 10 years of age will remain interested. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Micut, a good couple to do, came to bring a younger younger brother from their orphanage to their son George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They are back home with their new-born new brother ... a double-dressed mouse called Stuart (expressed by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to find the feeling of belonging, even if he is in a super-dimensional world containing the Snowbell pet cat of his new family (expressed by Nathan Lane). Stuart is involved in the experience of family loyalty and general friendship. George will eventually accept his new brother when the dracer dressed with Stuart saves the embarrassment of a boat model. Also in the cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And his voices: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
