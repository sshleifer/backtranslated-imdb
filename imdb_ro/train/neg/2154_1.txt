Let me confess. I found this used video and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in underwear on the jacket. But there was another story inside. In addition to the fact that the film was basically a parody of special "invisible-human" effects (very visible strings and other such elements), the script did not miss a chance - in fact it was out of the way - in insulting everyone - real and imagined WASP and gay races. Each insult that targets a person in the script was either homophobic, racist, or both. Start your nerves hurrying along with shocking sound, room-style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat a surprise. But once you get there, you do not care at all. Too bad, it could be a pretty good movie.
