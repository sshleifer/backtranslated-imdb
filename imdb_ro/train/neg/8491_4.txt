Despite some original occasional touches, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the background for Victorian interiors, with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this movie fails and eventually disappoints. Newcomer Francesca Faridany seems to be talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character who, until the mid-movie, is just looking at a monitor that follows a story from Lady Ada, an autobiography. "Conceiving Ada" shortens when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera belongs to facial expressions, manners, even making them appear translucent or instantly invisible, appearing in scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" rendering of it. A direct biopic of Ada Lovelace would be, but unfortunately, this film makes a crisis of both Lady Ada's life and a modern computer scientist (and her boyfriend, cute, over the course of her life).
