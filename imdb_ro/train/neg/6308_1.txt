The complete mark for the film's content, as a British, did not know there was segregation in the US Navy during the Second World War. A very courageous attempt to bring this to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction is non-existent, the act is wood, and the script is just one scroll after another. I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat down and I cracked from the very beginning to the very poor in a way that this was put together. It could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad problem of the problem is how it was put together. It is regrettable that a true story like this one, which could have changed people's attitude, was scattered by a low-budget, beloved film. I just hope that in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and will be right.
