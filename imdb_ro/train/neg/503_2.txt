After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to overturn the bottom of the drum with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I did not find NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. The story is simple. A mysterious number invites more actresses to his castle for a small holiday. After some sexual sex, the girls are beheaded one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herring in this place than on the local fish market Friday. The rhythm is terrible. The story is stupid, and the scenes on the skin are not that wonderful.
