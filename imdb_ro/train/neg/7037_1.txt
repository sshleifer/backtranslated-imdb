This is really a terrible movie and a 2 hour loss of your life. It is both gentle and offensive, with nudity and many and many violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. Also, the plot is the best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard that this movie should be fun, but it is not. I never laughed when I looked at her, I did not even smile. The producers of this film tried to combine a comedy film with action film and failed in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some bad movies are fun because they are so bad, but it's not one of them.
