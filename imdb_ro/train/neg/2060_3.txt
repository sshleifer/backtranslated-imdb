A repressed housewife (Angie Dickinson, whose double body betrays / terrifies her with extreme delight in her delicacy) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to get away. This results in a murder that soon involves a first class prostitute (Nancy Allen, obviously in the wrong business if she can bring home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you look at De Palma (excuse me, "pay homage"), Hitchcock, watch the "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill", while being loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the weirdest thrillers I have had the discontent of sitting. The terrain is absurd and tired. It has a series of surprisingly effective scams and serious crime sequences, which should be enjoyable to horror fans, as long as they can cross the stupid line of the story, which must have been dated back to 1980.
