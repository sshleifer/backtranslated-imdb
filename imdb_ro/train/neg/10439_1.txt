I would like to think like a fairly open guy and I need a lot (!) To not like a movie, but this is undoubtedly one of the most succinct and crappiest movies I have ever seen! > <br /> I have no idea what's wrong with those who gave him such a good rating here (imdb is usually quite reliable when it comes to rating) ... The only thing I can imagine is that people voted under one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While they were injured / murdered 2. They received heavy money for votes 3. Under arms <br /> <br /> I can not believe I lost a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this a pathetic excuse for a movie.
