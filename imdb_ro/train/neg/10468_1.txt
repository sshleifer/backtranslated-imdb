I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a terrible movie. The script, the direction and the role were just as bad. The story was bad and bad. The director could have made a smart and challenging movie, but he did not. I slipped into my chair for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where did the movie focus? Where was there something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was done strangely and a waste of money. You do not see this movie.
