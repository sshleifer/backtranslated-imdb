waste of my life ... the director should be embarrassed. why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. when he died at the end, he made me laugh. I had to change the channel several times throughout the movie, because I was embarrassed by looking at such a bad action. we hope the guy who played Heath will not work again. In addition, I hope the director will never make another film and that his salary has been taken back for this bullshit. {.02 out of 10}
