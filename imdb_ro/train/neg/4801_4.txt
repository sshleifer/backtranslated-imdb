I really liked this movie. It has a pleasant atmosphere in prison, conspiracy theories, a blood-thirsty zombie, a perfect touch of 80 minutes and it's a directorial effort of actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad guess (a guy) of a bad guy . It reminds me of some Italian horror films (loved ones). But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmare / frightening moment there. It goes further and further, and then (logically) it must end. More bold suspicions and visions and his destiny as a classical cult would have been sealed.
