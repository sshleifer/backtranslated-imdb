I do not know who took the idea that orcs are going around killing people and defeating and destroying things for revenge, but my god is absurd. Orcas is definitely not the cold-blooded killer this film makes them ... stupid. Orcas is extremely smart, does not misunderstand me, but I doubt he knows and understands a concept, such as revenge. So I have to say that everything that came out of this movie was fun how absurd it was. So I was at least amused by her. Personally, I would recommend you go and see Jaws if you want to see a Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you are like me and you want to laugh at something so far from realism, then I would say you go further. : D
