Freeway Killer, he is a madman who shoots people on the highway while shouting a bunch of mystical singing on a car phone. Police think she's a random murderer, but Sunny, the blond heroine played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects a pattern. So did the former cop, played by James Russo, and united his forces and bodies in search of the bastard who disappeared with their husbands. Also in the role of Richard Belzer, this movie has special moments, especially if you like car games, but it's not a good movie, check it out if you're really bored and you've already seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown, otherwise stay away from the highway.
