This is a superficial, naive and rather unfortunate depressing look at an incredibly wild relationship between Brooks' psychotic editor and Harold, his valet friend. The two of them have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is unable to do anything, in addition to looking pretty good at this stage of his career; but also because Brooks's character is neither interesting nor pleasant. There are 15 minutes static, crowded at the beginning, where Brooks, after breaking up with Harold, shot his apartment in a depressed, drugged-unbearable state. Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker "You're so beautiful," it's just not enough material for a feature film. Nothing happens at the outskirts of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to shine a bright white light on the business and, in a way, to deconstruct it; but if you will make the writing and the action have to be much better than what is here.
