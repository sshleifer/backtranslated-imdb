My friends and I left after 15 minutes and I was not the first. After that, we tried to get our money back. Theater theater management would not allow this, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time he worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: The former child. As you can say, it was not a memorable night. Probably one of the worst movie nights. Almost the second must be when I saw a double header of Lord and Heist Destruction. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please do not see the Order.
