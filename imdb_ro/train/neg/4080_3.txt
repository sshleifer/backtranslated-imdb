This seems to be one of those movies we think we would like, but we did not. They seem to be trying too hard to be "artistes." All flash, no content. It has some pretty scenes, and any one of them is nice to look at, but tighten them together and it becomes a difficult task just to sit on it. I hired this because of the shining comments on the video box and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found a bit picky and sometimes boring.
