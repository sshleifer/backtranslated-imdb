I hired him to see Vanesa Talor again. He can act, but he has no chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is a photograph of the mountain scenery crane. It has to come from a stock archive because the movie is shot directly on the video tape. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ look professional. There is a really raw animated statue, but there are no other remarkable effects. This movie is bad, but not funny like that. Players would prefer not to mention their CVs.
