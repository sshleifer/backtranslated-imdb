Filmfour will have to do much better than this little bite of a movie if they get the right reputation for themselves. This movie is set in Glasgow (although only a movie some secondary characters have something that comes close to a Scottish accent). The premise, about people living nowhere, who all meet in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning, having jobs at night, could make a truly entertaining culinary movie full of strange views. Instead, we have a group of self-obsessed saddlers and a plot that has been done so much that I'm surprised that it was not forbidden. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y sleeps with Z. Oh, you know. A total loss of time. Painful Dialogue - sounds like something that a 16-year-old group would have written for a GCSE drama project. The feminine character was completely useless - it was just written as a symbolic woman, with the hope that women would be tortured to see it. If you're a kind of grown-up boy who laughs at beer advertising, and you can usually find packed wandering that shouts on Saturday night in unclear urban centers, then you'll enjoy this movie and you'll find it "a laff right" . Everyone, run, do not get away from this bad evil a little. And a question, when the group left the "boring" town on the seashore (Saltcoats accidentally, although they changed their name on the film), to go back to Glasgow, why they did it through Forton's LANCASTER highway services which is it in England?
