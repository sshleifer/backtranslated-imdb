Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as read in other reviews, this movie has no plot, no character development, they probably had some sort of scenario, but it's hard to say on the the real end result. <br /> <The film's edition was really nonexistent, it tends to jump from scene to stage without any connection or anything else to help the spectator determine what's going on. is simply a small budget zombie movie that has not been thought of at all, has a bad role, bad dialogue, everything bad. The only thing that saves this movie from 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think it has to be where they spent the money they had to try to justify this. If you are not (like me) dedicated to finding and tracking all zombie shooting, you can not forget this. Period.
