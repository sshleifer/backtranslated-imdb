I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are standing and seeing this garbage? Okay, my dad and mom love lol, but I assure you I'm good from the room before it lights up. It's so depressing and disturbing, but the worst thing is that the action can not support all detective programs, like this because the detectives are so wood and heart. What happened to detective programs with true mystery ??? I mean who wants to know what happened to the fictional characters that we do not know about that he died over 20 years ago ??? I want the BBC to put more comedy on bbc1 now, for the dickie vicar has finished, there's more room for that bullshit.
