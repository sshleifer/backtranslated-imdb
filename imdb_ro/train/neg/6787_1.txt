I'm sorry to report that I've seen this movie several times. When she bombed at the box office, she was repeated overnight for a month on HBO. And I have always looked at it, because television is generally so bad - or it was at that moment. I do not forget, so it could be wonderful now - as Samuel L Jackson says about swine: "He could taste sweet potato pie but I will never know because I will not eat the dirty mess." See. Dudley interprets Arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came out immediately after Bryan's life, so you can guess where the inspiration came for it. The few funny bits are trying too long until you close your eyes and swallow your teeth. There is a scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both being dragged and dehydrated, dead of thirst. Then they meet like old knowledge that did not know each other very well, promise to have lunch. It could be funny. But the scene I remember most clearly is a meeting with the pharaoh in which the pharaoh is a black street kid made in King King Tut. He probably read the lines because at some point before the release, they were overtaken by the Hollywood equivalent of the black street lane, expressed by a Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno-wannabe). Or could it be Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They've managed to turn the dull boring scene into a very racist, very unpleasant and very long piece, a legendary thing that will not wash, no matter how much you try, so leave it there for someone else to cope. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my review. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY WHEN YOU DO!) Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a pack of six packages of Corona. Now that they have remodeled Poseiden Adventure, this one is probably great on the remake list. Maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.
