Another weak entry in season three, "Is there no true beauty"? however, has at least one key element of the plot, which is very different and, as Spock said, fascinating. The main character is a stranger who has to be transported in a black box because his appearance is so terrible that he makes people crazy. It's too bad that the episode can not live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think it was a mistake to "show" the stranger because his real vision is not even approaching the closeness of such a discouraging discovery; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic wake screen used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something like that. In any case, the appearance of Kollos can be at least tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock has a special viewfinder. (For a long time, I thought the alien's name was "Carlos", which we found humorous, but we did a digression.) Spock is needed in mind merged with Kollos at a time, so that the alien can drive Enterprise back safely. This is fulfilled, but when Spock / Kollos returns to the end of his mind, through the blank, Spock forgets his viewfinder. Uh oh. He becomes mad, but eventually recovers with the assistant of Kollos, a blind woman with psychic powers. This could have been a very bizarre, excellent episode, but he is badly miserable and is still meeting as a seriously executed event of the last season of the series.
