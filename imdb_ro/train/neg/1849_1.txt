I was interested in seeing the movement thinking it might be a tough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrifying direction (the sequences do not flow), even if the director could say it is which is because it looks very uninspired and immature) editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs, and the stock was low budget video. I would say it was not as simple as a digital mini-video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to set a movie with what the directory has, such as editing, etc. But it is obvious that he just does not care. There is just as much effort as a ham sandwich in this movie. It could be done better, but that would mean extra work.
