Dane tries to make mistakes and ends with all kinds of cries and cries, giving water to himself and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, make yourself together and make us laugh. I did not really understand his comparison with rock stars and comics. Just because they're both on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really alive when he was alive. He had some good jokes, such as the Burger King joke, in which people shout at the unit. I also liked Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane had not been so mentally, it would be more funny and a higher rating could be given, as great as eight.
