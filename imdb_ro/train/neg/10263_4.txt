Yeah, The Southern Star has a pretty forgettable title song sung by that hard-line crotonier Matt Monro. There is plenty to set the tone for this swollen and rather boring, amazing miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple looking for a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) watching an ostrich, a bunch of wild movies and a blurry and boring photo by Raoul Coutard, and you'll end up with an extremely inexplicable story through Senegal's jungles.
