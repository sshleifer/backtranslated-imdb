I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I liked. However, this boy seemed to last forever. It's one of those movies that enjoys the sad placement of the PG-13 while it's not suitable for the baby. Banknotes are not just jokes, but also jokes, they are brutal, cursed, and many actions cross the borders not just for a bad taste but also for legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been chopped to get the PG-13 rating ... too bad ... could have done a bigger splash like an R-rated movie if the fun was left inside (overestimation? Probably.) does not recommend this movie. It's a waste of time ... and I'm a film lover and I'm just about to give a shot. At 45 minutes in, the movie felt it should have twisted ... and the boy was ready for it. The end is weird, but it does not save the rest of this trap / hiking traps. 1/2 star (glad I saw it as a freebie ... it would have been bad to pay hard earned gains for this club)
