Beginning with its long-lasting shooting of seemingly endless rows of workers in the assembly line in a Chinese factory, Crafted Landscapes are trying to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. His eager narration implies that industrial development in China and elsewhere is unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. There may be a connection between the current Asian attempts of industrialization and wealth, and past experiences of famine and terror are never mentioned. At the same time, there is an effort to present Edward Burtynsky's photos about industrial waste are somehow "beautiful". Much of the movie is a slide show of these images. They are well produced, the size of the museum and apparently appeared in several exhibitions. For me, however, they show that almost any photo can be made to appear beautiful if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photos and the spoken message of the movie remains unclear. I do not mean there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries are rushing to industrialize. The landscaping factories, however, offer only a strange and bitter hope. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it is of some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American left (and Canadian).
