If you are not twelve, this movie is not worth it. It's obviously a low budget movie with actors B and a genre like fantasy, which sometimes requires intense CGI activity that is not good. I knew it would be bad when we rented it. I like to laugh at the bad movies. I did not know how bad it was. It's cute until after 2 o'clock, then it really starts burning. Battle layers go between normal struggles that obey the laws of physics and the struggle against the wires. There is no real explanation for transitions. She has a plot, but again, it's obvious a child's movie. It seems that there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are transmitted, such as Sesame Street or something like that. It's bearable. But much better if you are, let's say, new.
