This movie had so many promises. I was very excited about this movie. Eventually, it was ridiculous the best, painful in the worst case. The acting styles really did really, flat (angels, wife and daughter) over-animated (Casper's character). I felt that dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the public instead of real people who were trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene about the "bug". It's pretty much an insult to the public's ability to figure it out. In defending that scene, however, he had the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to different locations abroad. Too bad they did not use it. I did not feel like I was transported to exotic locations. Anyone could introduce images of the Colosseum in Rome. However, to put an end to a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the charts displayed on the decoding computers. It is my opinion (and that's what it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor were much smaller and the ACTION factor would have increased, this movie would have been good.
