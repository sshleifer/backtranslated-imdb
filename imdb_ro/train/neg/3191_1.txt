There are terrible movies and there are movies that are so terrifying that they are considered forgotten widely and undiscovered. Also, a lot of violence and bad stuff (not just the briceag stuff, you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with so bad content? Why, "final justice" of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of that film, and he was riffed by Joel and Bots on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now this time, with Mike taking Joel on the satellite of love (but with the same robots), that trio made fun of MST3K's second film, Joe Don Baker, "Final Justice." Of course, much of the rude things I mentioned have been removed for television release, but still, I want to see this episode (and "Mitchell") because what Joe Don "hates" the most? Why, none other than "The Mystery 3000 Science Theater!" <br /> <br /> If you have a Big Lots nearby, check if the tape shop is smooth! LOL That's what happened to another user!
