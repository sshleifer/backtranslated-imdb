This film is a twisted nonsense of a Japanese film about a dysfunctional family ending with a strange violent guest who just sits back and looks the worst of the four family members. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sexual drugs and violence stretched to such a limit. I am surprised to have passed the censors. In general, I think it will only appeal to those who should not be encouraging, rather than any underlying supposed message going out for the rest of us to consider. A film that has inflamed the worst element of society and is deep in the wound anyway ... A disappointment from a man who made sublime Dead or Alive and Audition.
