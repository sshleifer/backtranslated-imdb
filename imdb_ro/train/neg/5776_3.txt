bad action, southern accents, inconsistent cinema, horrible scenario ... We are waiting for this movie at a recent film festival and it was so discouraged after seeing it. It contains a talent quote / unquote name, but it does not deliver. Of course, the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is said. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered
