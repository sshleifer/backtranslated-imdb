Before we started this film for television, we had relatively low expectations. That's because it was done after the final episode of the show was broadcast and many of the series' original disappeared. There are no Presidents Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the second episode of the series, all the usual, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, left the B-5 permanently. Now for this film, they have returned Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack, and Captain and Doctor make a brief and irrelevant appearance. But the movie is about a soul mistress (Martin Sheen) who is headed to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a warehouse hidden by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of scary things with mumbo-jumbo take place, but honestly it was pretty stupid and useless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but I honestly felt it was a case of "it was done there - and it did much better in the past." <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, more for the convenience of the comic, was more interesting because an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command were not sure what to do and when they tried to press them to close, they were slammed with a lawsuit. This was fluffy, but he offered some laughs - something else that was not really plotting. By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing The Hunter - with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly, during the episode, he fell out of character. This should have been seen and corrected. So the final verdict is only for the hard-hard B-5 nuts (like me). Others see that they might assume the sucking series - which is a great injustice. This is an excellent example of a show that does not know when to give up.
