In Japan in the seventeenth century, a samurai lived that would set the standard for centuries. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey all over the world to buy 5,000 bites from the king of Spain. While at sea a violent storm swallows precious gold that intends to buy weapons and almost takes its life. Mayeda has to struggle with every chance of surviving and assuring the fate of her Japanese lover. Shoeda Mayeda is an epic action adventure set in several million dollars on three continents. In the role of Sho Kiss, Davies (Trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (Seven Samurai, The Throne of the Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a masterpiece of the film. The Osaka winning stunt team bought Bob Ivy's screen brings battle / action sequences such as the opening battle against the Oriental Army, the attack on the Mayeda ship wearing the invaluable jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. An excellent musical score of the well-known composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi has not even been nominated for Oscar for this film dealing with emotional conflicts such as the death of the Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after glory, all treated very well. Highly recommended kinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Note: All of the above are opposed to the movie in question.
