This movie is garbage. An imbecile intellectual cares to do whatever is best to support the superiority of the aristocrat to the working class. Nothing but a catharsis of self-satisfaction. Disgusting. If such a movie is set in the US, it will certainly be a big joke. And simply because it comes out of the "other side", a masterpiece is made, a wonderful fun for Western brainwashed and / or brainwashing (maybe George W.). A typical cold war sequelae, anyway a joke. I would say that if this - as it is expressed in this film - is what the Soviet intellectuals had thought about those years, then perhaps they deserve all the misfortunes that they claim to have passed. BUT NO! because, like many others, I read and watched the true masterpieces made by true Soviet intellectuals. For example, something relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both the book by Gavriil Troyepolsky and Stanislav Rostotsky's - is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true pride and real dignity, one of the best in the Soviet era.
