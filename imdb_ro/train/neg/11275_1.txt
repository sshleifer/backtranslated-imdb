This is a truly "LOCK STOCK" clone with a stellar cast and a terrible scenario. I have no idea why so many top British actors have subscribed to this junk, they must have been bribed. A storyless match goes on forever and forever, and if I had not paid good money for that, I would have stopped it in 10 minutes. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, that honesty goes to the truly pathetic treasure of a "GUMMO" movie (I feel like the so-called "director" for the movie lost time and half of my life), but this garbage is almost right there with him. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Such things remind Hollywood that they do not have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
