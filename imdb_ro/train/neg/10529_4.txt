Dir-Walter Lang): The musical disappointment at a point of character development, in my opinion, from this famous play by Rodgers and Hammerstein. There are some good songs and a decent comic portrait, sometimes Siam's king by Yul Brynner - but the film does not really do a good job of presenting the situation and settings. I can only blame the scenario and possibly some who behave why we do not fully understand their character and their situations. I know it would be a little too much to ask for a music for the joy of singing and dancing, but even this part did not leave me too much. The basic story is about an English woman who comes to Siam to teach children about last generation European things. We learn later that the king is actually the greatest student. There is a forbidden story banned between King's new wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latino as an Arab - come!) And a former boyfriend that causes some complications, but it was not really very fascinating. Deborah Kerr, as the main female character Annie - is OK, but not so convincing. The King learns a few things because of his presence and then the film fades as he does. This is indeed a tiny story with some songs and dances, but not so much of an experience for a viewer indeed.
