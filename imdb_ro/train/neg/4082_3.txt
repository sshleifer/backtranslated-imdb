This movie was painful just to look ... not in the dramatic good way that makes you entertain emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I did quite as much as the last sentence until I am shower), but in an absolutely boring for two hours. Now, you can all think I'm just an ignorant reviewer who has no respect for Shakespeare or the "artistic movie" ... well, you would have been wrong in both cases. I like Shakespeare's works, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I watched a lot of "arthouse" movies such as Eraserhead surreal and well done and 8Â½ of Fellini. .. but that was just over two hours of Shakespeare lost in translation, a lot of nudity WAY (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenarios ... but not every other movie filming! NEVER FOR STORY!) And, in principle, just a big shot. We had great expectations for this movie in the sense that it is said to be "very artistic" and that it was an adaptation to Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was just an extreme defeat. I gave him only three films because of Sir John Gielgud's current presence (which far surpassed all the names in this movie) and the combination of cinema / scene because he did a lot of scenes that look like moving paintings ... however, a lot of this movie would have been better than just a painting with a scrolling text below. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli had received the director's seat, it would have been a lot better. But this is the opinion of a member of the audience, many others can enjoy this much more than I do. That being said, if you can not find it at any nearby video store (it's not currently on DVD), do not try to go too far from the path to find it ... it's not really worth it.
