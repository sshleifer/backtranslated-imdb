This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks he can both write and direct his own film. Do it, you can not. Because there is no one here to tell you when you break big holes in the plot, you have meaningless transitions, a strange and awesome dialogue, and you can turn a fairly cold Korean legend into a pile of turbid celluloid steam. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie as a popcorn shot, I even did it; I like a lot of horrible movies. But once I was forced to wonder what the hell happened and why, sir, why? more than a few times, I really can not take it anymore. I would also like somebody to explain how LA became Mordor for the last scene.
