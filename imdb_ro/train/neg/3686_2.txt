I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this is a good movie. It was the weirdest thriller I ever did that I saw. We have the "bad guy" who wants to force the good guy (or the girls in this case) to do something or cope with the consequences. The "good girl" of this film has to use its intelligence and abilities to defeat the "bad guy" and save the day and the loved ones. Using charisma, courage and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (a beautiful name) at an airport. A coincidence leads to another and soon it seems that fate brings these two together. By sharing beverages, sitting next to each other, seemingly going in any way ... Is there any more of this oddity? Could these two mentions be the same for each other? "Fate" has a reason for their weird and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it seems, unfortunately yes. Jackson must help Lisa assassinate the director of internal security by moving him from one room to another so his men can launch an attack on him. If she does not do that, her dad is dead. Although we never know the exact reasons and who really is behind this madness, Jackson explains more about how this will happen and why it is in Lisa's interest to help him. Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plan with her intelligence and in this process stabbed him in the throat, making him travel on the chairs and hitting him with a hockey stick on the field. Oh, and before that, he leads him wildly through Miami airport where he goes through the security post and steals a car he uses later to run over the man who was ordered to kill her dad. <br /> <br /> First of all, it seems strange to me that a man like Jackson who can take his hands on high tech weapons needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not a bomb slip in the building? Would not this make it safer for him and his team by leaving any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson explain everything they'll do to somebody they threaten? Is not it easier to stop the same people? <br /> <br /> Actors have done everything they can, considering the movie they have given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are however actors to take care of. I also think that Jayma Mays (who played the pleasant "Cynthia") will be a person we'll see more. It's too bad that everyone is left with this. 2 out of 10
