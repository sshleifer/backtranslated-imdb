If the only sex you ever had is with a farm animal, then the tagging line for this movie is probably still misleading. This is by far one of the most boring movies I've ever had to try and watch lately. I found the DVD that was around my friend's house and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. I can not say details without destroying the movie because there are only about 5 movie details. Try to imagine that someone is making a movie about things on c-span, only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate about c-span. I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I was not able to say exactly what it was after I took my eyes off and threw them to Richard Gere.
