Yes, the subject is a straight quote from the film and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to die with this useless effort. All flashes, etc. meaningless after the first 20 minutes is just a bad movie. If you're epileptic, you'd have died at least five times. Of course, all of David Lynch's fans will pick up a banner for this type of turkey to be "the best movie ever made" because it makes no sense and when it does not make sense it must be art and art the movie is always good. Right? I say WRONG. This kind of artificial art is just a pathetic way to try to show that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins, as an excellent actor, should stay in action.
