After I grew up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from Gilley, I can tell you this movie is wrong. Most texans do not live as the film looks like. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are fun and strengthens the stereotypical image that all Texans consume beer, "diligent," "rednecks". Terrible accents of Texas are what she kills for me. True, there is a certain type of Texas for most Texan accents, but these people overcome it. You can not make anyone in New Jersey and Ohio make Texas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta should have stayed in the disco dance or in the '50s. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl than she is like a texan.
