There may be something poetically right to see dentists suffer. Suffer them in this terrible movie, really terrible, but they cause the audience to suffer from the non-dental variety. If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming children, old children, sick children, a lot of long and meaningful looks, a wife with a dead man and a worried husband: it's here for you. The boring, long-standing one stands out as one of those examples that shouts: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes it is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with pretty good songs. Save your money or, if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
