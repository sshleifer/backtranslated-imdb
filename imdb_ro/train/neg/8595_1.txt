Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors who can certainly stand up to any challenge that has been put to them. Unfortunately, "Watching the Detectives (2007)" offers just one to both the actors and the audience: do not fall asleep during a bored, very predictable and unimaginable story. "Watching the Detectives (2007)" is trying very hard to be fun, but the comedy is forced, extremely stupid and embarrassing to the point of ridicule. After a third of the film, nothing that could capture even the most wanted audience, such as director's friends and relatives, is even suggested, not to mention. . I'm pretty sure all those who liked it falsified it or they had to fake it like Neil's ex girlfriend when they showed him an old B & W movie he does not care less about . "Watching the Detectives (2007)" is not close to Category B, falls somewhere between Q & R, like "Questions?" and - repress questions! The Director knows what he's doing! Well, if his purpose was to take the viewer to death, he did a really good job! "Watching the Detectives (2007)" was a total waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur Please do not let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
