This movie is one of my favorites. It's not good at all, but it's great to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and can not act properly (for example, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help with the answers"). Any struggle is more or less surreal. Make sure you watch for Brock, the type of white guy that attacks the main characters. He has only two lines, but he's one of the best in the movie!
