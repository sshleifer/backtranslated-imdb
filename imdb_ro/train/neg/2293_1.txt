If this series should be an improvement on Batman - The Animated Series, I, for one, think it has failed terribly. The character's drawing is stupid ... (Catwoman, for example, it looks terrible ...) But what really annoyed me was that it made Batman look like a kind of stutter that can not care for himself battle without the help of the two, even the third opponent. I mean, it's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be Batman's allies besides Robin, but still ... making Batman say he needs help from them ... What, he can not cope with a few hits? In BTAS, he could face a dozen adversaries without problems ... aging? Come on ... And one more thing: I really do not think Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to fight soon without the hard training years. One is irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible) and two, it's not what happened in the comic strip if we have to remain faithful to them. Batman - The animated series has made history, with animation, stories and characters ... That was a Batman legend. The New Adventures series turned the legend into another Batman hit.
