WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Appearance Report: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mixed with a few scratches (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after they went to visit a theater burning in their absence! Undoubtedly, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... Leo McCarey's comedy set the narrative frame for the masterpiece of William Seiter, SONS OF THE DESERT (1934), with L & H playing casualties, forced to say a monstrous lie that returns spectacularly. Much of this is very funny, especially the scene where Stan is teased by Deslys, leading to a violent push and push game. However, some of the fun is underlined by Oakland and Flowers, playing their completely straight roles, which adds an inconvenience to the "henpecked" husband scenario. Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
