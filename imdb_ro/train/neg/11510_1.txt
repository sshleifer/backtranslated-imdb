It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me look at her. There is nothing positive to say about this movie. There have been many years of thinking that Madonna might act, but it can not. It has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he is only mediated. An embarrassment. <br /> <br />
