Okay, I wrote a stupid review b / c movie is terrible. As we wait for another review (for Derrida) mine to appear, I decided to look at the old reviews of this terrible movie. Look at all the positive reviews. Everyone, say ALL, coming from collaborators, did not rate another movie than this one. Crimminy! and wait until you return to the Rosebud magazine [sic]. Check out Rosebud's other revised reviews and brilliant recommendations. Oh, shoot it, it happens to be for the other films of the two writers and directors. Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you could not get out of a bad scenario. You do not have jobs for yourself! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK ALL POSITIVE RECEIVES FOR A LOTTERY MOVIE!
