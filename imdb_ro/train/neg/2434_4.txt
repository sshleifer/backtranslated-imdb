Realistic film, sure, except that the characters do not seem to be scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not seem to do it. That's why I do not like performance in this movie. Tom Berenger plays a soldier again. Without good emotions, realistic sequences. Not always shot, that's a great thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter sequence, because only one terrorist kills almost all of the navy ... Give it ** and half of *****
