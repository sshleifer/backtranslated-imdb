I have nothing to say, but it was terrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading misery. And if some actors do not want people to question their sexuality, then they should probably refrain from doing more of these movies. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think about what had happened was cut from the movie. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Revenge to think about the process of thinking and voyeurism that continued in the minds of the directors. As I said before a degrading mess. It's not really funny. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and it's not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
