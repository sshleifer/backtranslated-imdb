Spanish production very implausible, incredible and incoherent about ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The movie opens with a woman who has one of her cats killed by a young girl. Then she begs her boyfriend to take her somewhere on vacation. He calls his work and asks for his vacation time and says he'll pay for it. How relevant this interpretation is that someone guesses at the end of the movie because the guy, a harassing photographer, spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of Spanish horror films, seems to take her top bikini to take a picture , to ask her at lunch and then on her mission to Witches Mountain - for reasons we never ask for. Before she leaves, Patty must stop at the house and hear echoes in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with these two stops at an inn, going down the mountain, and finally realizing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has a certain atmosphere, some of the character actors are really good (especially the deaf and the old man), leaderships are at least adequate, and the climax - though it does not make any sense - is literally well- ) with white brass witches and long black hair. It just does not make any sense, and that's a big detractor for me. I could watch the movie ten times and still do not know much more than I did after the first view. This is a major problem. Mount Witches is a curious movie on the long line of European, cheap and atmospheric horror films that covered that decade. If you can get more of it than me, better power for you.
