Be warned! <br /> <br /> This is silly that other shit will not even make him in the company because he's under it! Okay, he got out of the way, let me say something more substantial. I have seen Ashes of Time a long time ago thinking that it is a fresh take over of the material that is based on the very wowed wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of director Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite the fact that WKW failed to adapt the novel on screen according to a lot of Wuxia fans; most of them are just dripping water drops, sweat beads, running legs, etc. I could not stay in most movies. I was doing it a lot sooner when I wanted to give Mr, After hearing more praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his last film, 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express, because it's the most accessible movie. So bad! I was just p.o. that I was deceived to waste my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional commentators mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a big modern city, bla, bla, bla. Everything is fine if the director has a point of view with something to say about why these things happen and tell them. But no, he only shows what he is. Faye Wong's actor is very typical of Hong Kong's style: stingy expression, deer in the expression of the wide-eyed eye, trying to be cute and girlandy to act; the rest of the song is just as uninspired. I think the word "Auteur" is a euphemism for a director who is trying something new and different, which should be applauded, but not one that has not yet mastered the art of cinematic stories, which is Mr. Wong in the last 17 years!
