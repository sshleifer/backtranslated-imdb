*** SPOILER ALERT *** I like Tim Roth, indeed, and he does all he can with an incredible role. I can see how it is a movie that might look good as a scenario, but it's complicated, unlikely and ultimately stupid. I saw the false death ending coming a mile away. Rene Z. tries hard with a subscribed part, like Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name they can not remember (who is not Chris Penn) is a big sweat actor. See if you are not smart enough to distinguish between such a smart film that you can not follow it, and so confused that you can not understand it. See if you like cheese room work that makes you hurt. See if you like to watch Tim Roth with a slim scenario. See if it comes late for free. Otherwise, rent the usual suspects.
