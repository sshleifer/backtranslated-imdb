This movie is like Conan Barabar, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere under all this despondency, but the filmmakers do not do a good job, showing it, which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill offers solid performance in the lead role, just like the bastard - who, unfortunately, has not appeared in anything else. And battle scenes are not too bad - I like the way Deathstalker allows his sword to "drink" the blood of his victims - and there is plenty of nudity and sex to temper the overall level of machismo. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
