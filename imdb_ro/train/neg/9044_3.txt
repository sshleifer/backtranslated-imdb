I really wanted to like this movie, but so much is stolen / borrowed from another job - part of the loan is painful. The review from the New York Times highlighted that their weighing turtle reminds awfully of Warner Brothers' famous cartoon ("Hello, my baby, greet my dear, greet ragtime gal ..."). But I challenge anyone to follow the animated feature of the Fox / Blue Sky Robot (2005) and not to find ridiculous resemblance in: story - A young inventor grows and a single innovative corporation distributes all the wonderful inventions. <br /> <br /> - A robust Robinson robot has a Robot-like design and both films use a retro-futuristic look. All this seems to be in sharp contradiction with Disney's unpleasant quote at the end, which means that the company has been a constant innovation that never looks back (which contradicts their entire catalog of 90s movies that were pretty many clones of each, with some minor attempts at story and ethnicity). Film makers do not seem to be able to let the story speak alone, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we do not have the time attention for nothing less. The bastard is very well designed and brilliantly animated, and it's a pleasure to look. Much of the rest of the movie seems to be thrown together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid 90's. The movie opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that Disney has never had much interest in innovation or in good stories - they seem to think that simply doing something on the big screen is a sufficient proof of their virtue.
