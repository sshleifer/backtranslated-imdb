I have to admit that there are a few matching movies that I read before seeing the film adaptation. Ninety-eighty-four happen to be one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and interesting of prophecy. But the movie was just sucked. It's slightly the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason why we did not stop after the first 5 minutes was that watching the movie was half a task in two parts for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to get a proper atmosphere. The act was nothing above average, and given that there was not much to do, it was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston was unable to pull more than one syllable at a time. Puzzling, disturbing and visually inappropriate, the film completely canibalized the book. Wait a minute ... Is not that British?
