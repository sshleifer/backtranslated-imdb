I saw the movie at a theater. As soon as I handed my money to him, he told me two words I never heard in a theater before or after: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I should have let her go to the money and go home. But no, crazy, I went in and watched the movie. This movie did not make anyone in the theater laugh. Not once. Not even inadvertently! Especially, I stood there in a sharp silence. Every ten minutes, someone would shout "This SUCKS movie!" The audience would enthusiastically applaud, then stood there in a sharp silence, bored for another ten minutes.
