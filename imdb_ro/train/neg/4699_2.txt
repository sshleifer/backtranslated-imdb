wow, the Naked Brothers group. What should I say? I think I can say this show is just crazy. number one: they have no talent, probably they can not even play the instruments. Number 2: In terms of advertising, they said they were famous, but no one ever heard of them until there was a fiery show. Look, I really do not hate that bad, I'd give it like 4 out of 10, but what bothers me is how everyone says she has such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes profound lyrics. Deep in the ass! he talks about heavy fighters with inner feelings. wow, I could read what she says on the walls of a bath and it would be deeper than that. And they did not make themselves known, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children to be too, so they did a bad show. I feel like it will be canceled soon.
