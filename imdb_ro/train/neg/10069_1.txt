This is a terrible movie. Yes, the girls are beautiful, but not very good. Pleasure with a cowboy engaging in an Indian girl would be interesting if sex did not stay in the way. Well, maybe it would be interesting, but not because it was so bad and it only acted partially. I can only imagine the amazing ears of dance on a big screen, probably smarter than when they did it on television. (I will not even refer to the two-legged knife struggle between two women who are bound together and spend everything in the chest. Never read about it in the old West) This is a film that requires a liberal use of fast forward. /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not go to such movies and they do not tend to be very good, the plot that takes a back seat for the breasts. Nude original cuties as they are called were originally nude movies or movies where there was no touch, but as the adult industry began to grow film makers either tried to be smart or tried to exploit something else , to put butts in the chairs. The smart ones were very few, leaving only hacks with limited talent. The comedies have often broken off with the humor approaching the first class, infantile, but harmlessly fun. Something rarely could be said about any other kind of cross dressed like a nudge. Ramrodder looks good and has some beautiful pieces, but he did not do either western film or sex. > <br /> I do not have to look at it again. Perhaps no one interested, the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for killing a school teacher not long after the filming shot. Obviously, such things will ruin some people's lives.
