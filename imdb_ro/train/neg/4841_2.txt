REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I am really amazed to see the shining comments here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is a big, pathetic, granular clich√©. I would have laughed aloud and much, but it was a meeting with a former military. I could not hide the other's answer, BOREDOM. Yeah, I think my date, a good old boy's payline, I liked. It's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work ... Okay for the others. But Ralph, come on. It was a painful pain from Ralph. I vote 2 just because Ralph watched SO STUNNING. But I have to go, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I will look at the end of the business to heal and recover now .... C1
