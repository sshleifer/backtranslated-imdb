I read in the newspapers that W.Snipes was broken, so it's no wonder he will be taking part in low-budget projects such as The Contractor. He is just the next star of action to join a growing club: the action stars of the 1990s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays the lead role in a cheap action movie shot in Bulgaria (we should think that the location is London, as if a full mother could buy it) The story is one of 1,000 other movies: The boy is again engaged by the government to do a dirty job - after the government wants to get rid of him - the good man walks away after killing the bad guys (it was a spoiler, is not it!) Star of the film: the little girl Bennett) is better than anyone else in cast! A star is for her plus a star for eye candy Lena Headey, it makes 2 stars. Only for the fans of the hard snip! All Others: Avoid!
