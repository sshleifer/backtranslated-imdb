The effect obtained in this story about a psychiatrist involved in contenders is so manners that I have to assume that this was the intended intention. The sets are artificial and at no time did I feel like watching a movie. It seemed that the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to each other. While the film has early film elements (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that it almost has to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. Since the presentation had no appeal to me, I expected at least an interesting story. Usually, I'm pretty slow about the storyline story, but you could see what came here in the first fifteen minutes. By the time I realized this was really ridiculous, "Gee, I forgot 80,000 dollars." For an experienced psychiatrist in terms of gambling addiction to behave so badly, it is beyond belief. If, at any stage, he behaves like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen aside. This wood production left me cold.
