It's a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "mysterious island." Editing the sound is pretty bad. You have heard the dialogue on the set and you hear the voices recorded on a recording cabinet at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors in Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and who read this comment will be amazed with a W capital. This film is full of flaws. You will hear the director's voice by giving directions and directions to the actress. "OK now stand." As for the other characters. There is the guy who speaks to the mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The stranger type speaks with a deep voice. When he gets married or eating when he struggles, you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work to shout aloud! Creatures are good, but animation is offensive. Very strange. A kind of animation by Karl Zeman in the CALENDAR AT THE FIRST TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Music is good music. The bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or THE PLANET OF THE DINOSAIR look like an epic Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that the MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoe budget line? You have to watch aspiring filmmakers.
