The film was to be presented here in Bangkok with all the fanfare, and even in the theater, it failed miserably. Apparently the writer's story does not have water. Something was definitely lacking. In my opinion, people must have a reason to look at it apart from the historical history of the past. The accuracy of history is not what we are looking for in entertainment. The film has no substance. The only way to make this film was in a way to make changes where it's a legend instead of a story. And a legend will have certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It's called the central theme. The movie does not succeed The answer, why should I look anyway? At least some legendary Legendary Elephant Flying, Mind King or Eccentric King, such as "The King and I" would have been great, something would have added a lot to the film appeal. I think there was no recourse but a simple vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> Once you receive the call, then the story is the next thing we focus on. In terms of marketing, we call it "we need to see". When you hear the title of the movie, people would say, "Oh, I have to see, where is Kingmaker's appeal? Why do not you reopen the title and say," How not to be king? "And make a black comedy of the old days Siamese , in the "Dr. Strangelove. "That would have been much more exciting." The similar narrative experiences of the king's weaknesses from the first people will make the movie very funny. "Most of today's films have" to see " such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have familiar characters, other movies such as the Island have had an appeal in themselves when advertising asks, "Still think there is an island?" < <br /> <br /> Or, for the movie, Repeated "How Not to Be King" might ask the question: "So you still want to be king?"
