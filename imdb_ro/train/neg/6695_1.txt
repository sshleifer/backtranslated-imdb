I had something for this Kari chicken for a while, and as far as she looked into this movie, no complaints. But after I caught it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: This is the only thing in the movie that is not under standards. The scenario is horrible, the act is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw in another comment someone commenting on how big the sex scenes ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so bad, you can turn it into a softcore porn, but instead I'll see some white whites that keep me from seeing Wuhrer's body and scenes that give me nothing else than a trickle. He should have behaved cinematically, so the film would not be a complete loss of time, but not. With such a terrible scenario, they should have capitalized on Wuhrer's appearance, because this is the only pro of the film. 2/10, just because it looked so hot.
