I found that the rhythm was glacial, and the original story breathed much in relation to the content. My wife slept for the most part of her and I did not try to wake her up because I felt there was nothing missing. When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then get caught, it's unclear how they could hide all the incoming and breaking tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the study is blocked, preventing servants from entering. The thing that puzzled me was at the very end when there was a brilliance in the face of broken status. I have no idea what this should represent.
