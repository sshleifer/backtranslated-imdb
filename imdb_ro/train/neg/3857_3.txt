We hoped the film would be fun as well as other genres. However, it was blades and I did not find much laughter. Look at HBO, maybe, or if you have a free waste disposal and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying for him to see him. The land is simple and simple and could have been fun, maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee may be hilarious, and he does some laughs here and there, but the movie crashes. You just do not go see this. The direction is unclear, but for what it is, the direction is not so important. I think its main disadvantage is that it's not very funny. See something else, do not waste your time here.
