I really like the cast, but the story is pretty slow. Danny Glover is doing a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have much place in the story as if he could have. I thought the first scene was a little over the grim top compared to how the story unfolded. I would look again, though. I rated it at 5 (I want to give it a score of 5.5)
