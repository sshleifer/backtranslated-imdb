This bomb is just an "explosion" after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. Indeed, pyrotechnics at the extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give 1 in 10. I would have made a zero, but this option was not allowed. I'm sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we need money. And I still refused to Tim Burton's farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to recognize that he was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this movie is not even a boy. I wish I could say "give me the money". You can bet if I can. But this is the problem with premium services, the variety of subscription.
