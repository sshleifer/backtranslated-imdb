This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have to disagree with another commentator, who said the special effects are fine. I found them pretty bad: it was just not realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted the story. Perhaps this distraction is the reason I did not fully understand the story. Archeologists are looking for the "set". It does not bother to say what set or what is so special about it. It's also not clear why she is looking for her in California, while the intro of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. If you are filming a movie in the desert, make the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - shows that he was shot inside a studio instead of a desert. The level of action has been constant throughout the movie, without rats and downs, without climax. It made the film look short, and it certainly is a pro for this movie.
