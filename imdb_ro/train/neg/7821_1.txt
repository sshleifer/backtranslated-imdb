Did movie makers even preview this before launching it? The Scripture jumps from place to place without giving much explanation. The top does not specify whether it is prequel or not. It starts with the beginnings of Superman on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but does not warn the spectator. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential homeowner, a stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The end is ridiculous. The superman who finished in a hospital just made me want to kill him. I'm seriously expected for an SNL outline where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results are in - in the case of the baby, Superman, you are the father." To summarize - OK by acting on this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but the HORRIBLE script. The film is basically undiscovered.
