The line of stories has been reloaded several times; "a breath of life in the retirement home". Several pieces, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news stories have fallen endlessly, but they are still an excellent platform for character studies. If Gideon was crafted more enthusiastically, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring, and the story is absolutely flooded by the clich√© (even Gideon's subtitling and summary of "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh at its inefficiency). The most indifferent thing is the final straw for this poor film, but the rest is gentle enough to make the actors almost irrelevant.
