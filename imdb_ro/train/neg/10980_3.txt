A truly frightening movie. It feels like it was done in the early 90s by a right person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, aspiring people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvation for sad, lonely, mad gays. Wow! Who knew? Supportive characters are caricatures of homosexual stereotypes (effeminate buffoon, bitter queen, lonely queen, beagle, etc.), and the main characters are milquetoast middle-class and midbrow, of little interest. <br /> <br /> As for the romantic and ideological battles of the main couple, we do not have much to say: we have seen it before and we have done much better.
