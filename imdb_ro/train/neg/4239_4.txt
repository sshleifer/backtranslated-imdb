This was a better movie than the average, I thought, because it was on the cable. I expected something similar to the raw melodrama and special bad effects seen in classic genres such as Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. The cast was well-liked ... I especially liked Ron Livingston, SWAT Commander, hard pressed. It's good to see him repeating the same material he was so fortunate about in Band of Brothers. Producers and designers have done their homework because all the scenes and shots were the same as they did that day in 1997. So if you have the chance to see this movie and I'm sure that since FX has taken it all over 50 times. .. take 2 hours and enjoy it.
