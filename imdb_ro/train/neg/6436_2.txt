I'm a good person, so I gave a movie 2 instead of 1. It was undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen for a long time. It was not a very small plot and the more interesting areas that have been reached, that is, what Jesus really wanted to know, were taken into consideration and instead we were given a high dose of sadistic punishment applied to heroine ours (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both her character and the public. The act was barely there, and the direction was uninspired. And if I saw another drop of water or a dove flying to the camera, I probably started screaming louder than Patricia.
