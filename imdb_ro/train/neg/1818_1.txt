Connie Hoffman is very cute and is sometimes attractive to topless. That is, folks. The only reason why you even think about what to see or not this movie. These 70-year-olds are sometimes fun due to their dating (pants, big hair, Zapata mustaches, etc.). This thing is not. The scenario is bad, the act is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a senior romantic romantic man is particularly bad. <br /> <br /> The title, suggesting a sexual comedy, is mistakenly misleading. I sincerely recommend this to avoid, like plague.
