If you've ever watched Dukes of Hazard, you know you do not have to worry about drugs or brutal or brutal behaviors seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know is no longer the case! This movie was HORRIBLE! The main characters that make drugs and think it is fun and cool is certainly not what they call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and turned it into garbage. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now looks and acts as if in the corner of the street, paying for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before I left, at 15 minutes in the movie I was ready to go. I thought it was supposed to improve, but instead worsened in a little while. I would never want to see this movie. She pulled a good show and left only horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, because it's not just a waste of money but a 2-hour loss of your life you will never come back!
