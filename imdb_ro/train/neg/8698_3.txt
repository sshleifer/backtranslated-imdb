Okay, I remember seeing the first one and the boy choked. After I saw him, I laughed and said, "Oh, boy, just a B movie with a low budget. I will never see a part in it." Then about 1 1/2 years later, two came. She blew even more. But I just laughed again and said, "I can not see a third part of it at all." Then about 1/2 a year, the third part came out. I was bad enough to rent him and boy, I just broke him after I saw him. God, I did not realize how much I can suck movies these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
