I am surprised that someone involved in producing this series would actually accept responsibility. The script is so unfortunate that it must have been written by someone who failed the admission exam of the Canadian Writers' Union (and that says something!). Remove the binoculars if you want, but there is nothing to look like a joke. Ronnie Corbett should have separated himself from the garbage. The rest of the cast is so deprived of any ability of acting or comedy. I am amazed that it took the past of the first episode - the correction, following auditions. All I can say to those who are amused about this is that it has to be very easy to have fun. And it is obvious that production costs must have been â‚¤ 100 per episode. And only if someone thinks I comment as a stranger who is not familiar with English humor, I have to add that I'm really English.
