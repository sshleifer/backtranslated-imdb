Extremely disappointing film based on James Michener's novel. What was even worse was Marlon Brando's performance. The drawing in the south was ridiculous. I woke up laughing when she spoke, calling as an elderly lady from the south, coming home to come back. Brando, so great in previous films, has been reduced here to a laughing background. Tyrone Power, in "Witness for the Prosecution," should have been nominated for Best Actor instead of Brando here. The film, which deals with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando faced stones throughout the movie. His move from these anti-professional relationships occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. Emotions and discussions have made it difficult to understand how they might be subject to such new views. Only Mr. knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki have received Oscars for their performance. Nothing about performance was as impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without describing anything on her part. Better performance in this movie was made by Miiko Taka, who played Brando's role well. She showed great excitement as the anti-American who found love with the Brando character. Her face was engraved by her misfortune because she lost her father and brother during the Second World War. She realized her dances did not come out of her life. the Jewish mother Yochobel of the "Ten Commandments" to the fancy mother of Brando's love interest at first. Her performance, along with that of Ricardo Montalban, was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction as to her interpretation.
