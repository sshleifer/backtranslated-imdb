!!!!! SPOILER POSIBIL !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that a story involving Archie Gray Owl - An Englishman featuring a red Indian - would have a massive amount of humor involved. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat a movie like this, in which a remarkable man is the bestial audience, is to treat him as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough is committing something similar to a murder, making GREY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he did an extremely bad movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the necessary charisma for the title role and romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by Wood as Annie Gaupeau) lacks any type of chemistry screen. But to be fair about their distribution did not help with the script that fails to portray Archie as naughty chappy is to trick everyone to believe he's a native american. Producers and writer have made the major mistake of having the film center around the twist plot by Archie being an Englishman - That's exactly why I wrote "the possible spoiler" did not actually reveal until late in the movie that the character the title is English, but it is obvious that everyone who saw this movie knew that before, therefore, absolutely no surprise makes the girls involved. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the landscape is wonderful and has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major ecologist of the 20th century, if the truth is told. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of Soylent VERDE (and possibly the two towers, if you want to class it as having a green message) that in fact, accessible, there was an ecological film great. In fact, most organic movies suck and this includes GRAY OWL, a movie that undoubtedly had a serious problem finding a distributor
