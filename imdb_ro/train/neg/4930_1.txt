Bad actors, a terrible scenario, absolutely absolutely incredible - this movie had everything. After seeing such movies, you wonder why the manufacturers have not bothered at all. This movie has absolutely nothing to say, all the methods used to create a scarecrow have been used repeatedly in previous horror films. A total loss of time.
