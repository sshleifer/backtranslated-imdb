Run away from this movie. Even through B movie standards, this film is terrible. It is also insidious in its theme. The main theme is that people who reject society and who have no respect for anything, are wonderful and deserve admiration. People who treat others with respect are defeated. Guncrazy is a film that speaks for those uprooted much better than this movie, you see in return. The normal child would not do what Trent does. State masters do not work as they do in this movie, etc. Seeing this movie, you realize why writers use the golden cliche. Miya is a totally disobedient prostitute who, yes, had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the public can not identify with her. Usually there is something for which a movie may be recommended, in which case there is none. It's such a ridiculous film that insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The actor is suited to the B standards, and the direction is nothing new or exciting.
