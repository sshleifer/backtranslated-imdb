Whether you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching this depends on how horror movies like you. If you like so much, God is terrible, hysterical, beware. Jigsaw is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead") and I say this as a low-budget horror / gore fan and seeing a good to compare it. I will not even get into the specifics of what makes this movie bad as it is, the only good thing is that it's so terrible that it's one of the funniest things I've seen over the years. If you can find this to rent cheap, it is definitely worth watching if you were involved in doing so - ashamed of you. : o) IMDb needs to introduce a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie, it's worth a lot.
