Poor Will will roll into the tomb if he could make this horror-TV adaptation of his classical piece. It is obvious that very little money has been spent. A stage stage, a podium, and some randomly placed columns pass as a set. The film was titled unprecedented in English, and English voice actors occasionally mumbled their lines. All production had an incredibly dark and disturbing feeling. And where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this ill-treatment treatment the treatment that just deserved. To be or not to be? I want this movie to have never been first.
