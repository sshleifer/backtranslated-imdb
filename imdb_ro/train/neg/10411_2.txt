It's funny. I've seen a bunch of Fassbinder movies and I've found that some are extremely creative and exciting, while others are repulsive and indulgent, like this movie. For me it varies from sea to shit - without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the "sophisticated", but I can not believe that a lot of appeal is a pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get many negative reviews for this), she made too many movies too fast and was too lenient. His homosexual films (like this one) tend to be very bad - made easily, sometimes quite dull (such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes even rough (like this film). Could his message of accepting a person's confusion of a person be treated better than to show him to snap him or to see that cows are slaughtered in a great way? It shows a certain sensitivity to the subject and makes your characters more humane and more sympathetic - then maybe I would like to watch movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honest at the point after watching this movie that I do not bother with other Fassbinder movies - the evil seems to be outside - weighing the good.
