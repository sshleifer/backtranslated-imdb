Dolph Lundgren plays the role of a temple that comes to New York when a key that unlocks the antichrist is found by an archaeologist, of course the demon is just a few miles behind Dolph and is not killed as easily as it shifts from body to body. (Like Fallen Without Suspension) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely undiscovered. I admit I'm a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I'm trying to watch them every time I'm on TV. I caught The Minion and I was disappointed by the boy. This movie is absolutely terrible. With so poorly organized and poorly edited sequences, you can barely make a coherent sense in the battlefield. The worst of all is Lundgren's infallible infusion as a tough priest (!), All of which makes it worse that the film is such a cut of Fallen (which was good) and the end of the days (which was bad, but better than that) This is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. It has nothing to recommend. It's terrible and it's the lowest point in Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, the Last Warrior and the Masters of the Universe. 1/2 * From 4 (Awful)
