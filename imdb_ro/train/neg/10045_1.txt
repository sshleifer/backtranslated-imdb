Everyone said that Tashan would be a great movie with great pleasure, but that's not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya has made a serious mistake as actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable in the whole movie. Her boyfriend look does not work well. Even the movie, the story of the movie does not make any sense. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino in India is Vijay, but Quetin is not at all. Talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid film. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar was also a victim of this film because it's all Saif. Style and Phomorola are not very good in this movie, I was disappointed
