It's just Robert De Niro's movie, which I really hate. It's a bad movie with horrible action (of course, not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to make his mafia films as always like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also liked the De Palma Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma at two different times, Greetings and Wedding. I also know that the Wedding Party was OK (I did not look at the Greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is very bad and unpleasant. There is no scene where I can smile even once. The movie lost the chance to be a funny style, even a little, in a "Be Black Baby" scene, and I also do not like the scene where a guy's sex organ appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! the worst. I hate.
