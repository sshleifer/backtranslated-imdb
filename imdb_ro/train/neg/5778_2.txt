Okay, so I was dying to see this movie. Stoked about "who's who" in the horror country in the movie ... well, my friend rented this thing, brought it and we started looking at it. It should have been a comedy ... I did not even smirk up to 40 minutes. Is it related to the budget? In no case, in fact, there are films costing NEVER and they are amazing (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I could not help understanding the similarities (for example STEALING) with a low-budget, indie film ACRESS APOCALYPSE, read my review of this movie (DESTROYS this BTW movie) br /> This movie ... really had the potential. She had "the power of the stars," the stolen plot (allows the movie behind the scenes to make a movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, this is bothering me more and more about me ), ... it really would have been fun. A lot of jokes collapse. The actor is fine for what he is. But it was dragged, it was not funny, and the plot was completely stolen. I gave this two, because it was NOT SOON AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
