We found this film as an interesting study in effect and effect, but little more than that. The basic story follows the lives of a thousand people and how their actions (deliberately and otherwise) influence the lives of others. The premise of the film holds a great promise, but I feel she fails to fulfill her promise. Too much time is spent telling the public about the theory of chaos and too little time, in fact, showing it. As a result, I never felt a true sense of any character and I never made a good relationship with them emotionally. By the end of the movie, I had a "like" about everyone. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but in its condition it's just that
