I bought this DVD set, unseen view, and I wish I did not. The script needed a serious rewriting because it seems to be totally devoid of any sense and pales compared to the book. The light is horrible, very unpolished, but if I just could ignore it. The script does not focus enough on characters ... there is no introduction of different characters, making it difficult to distinguish who is who (especially on planes - no idea that dies when). <br /> <br /> For a long time, I felt that the key to a good movie is to get the audience to take care of the characters; if you do not have nothing. There was no focus on the characters - you never knew them - who they were, what they liked ... what made them do the things they did. The series is 5 hours long and is divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did all the time if they did not have the characters detailed - they put a lot of stuff in it ... I'll say at least a whole hour is happening by watching the ground and taking off in LOL planes (I mean we really need to see this all the time and again ???). It would have given me a much higher rating if it improved the knowledge of the characters.
