I hired this thought that it might be interesting and could have been an interesting story, except that it was said in such an uninteresting manner. Difficult to follow, strange editing, split story, mumble characters, a tremendous loss of boring time. I could not get into it and I did not care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save this movie. If you do not need a cure for insomnia, I'll ignore it. 3/10, and that's generous.
