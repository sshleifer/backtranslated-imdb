Do not spend your money or time on this pitiful piece of cinema under the guise of cinema. When every third word is dedicated to the wrong language and there is no real plot, as well as a distribution of some old actors that still give the same dated performances of the past and have not evolved in the career, they leave much to say. I was expecting something better from the winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision others may have about Puertorricani will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as the Maldeamores. A wrong word at a given moment in a movie can be used to emphasize a certain point of view, and it may be fun or sad depending on its context (see Elsa and Fred, for example), but it should not to get into the plot. The film is a total embarrassment and it was absolutely nothing fun or even cute with this movie.
