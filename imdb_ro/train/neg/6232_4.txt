"Raw Force" is like an ultra-sharp and perverted version of Love Boat, with additional battles of Kung Fu, demigod monks, trade with white slaves, energetic zombies and lots of quality shows. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 box-set". It has everything that exploitative fanatics are looking for, mixing in a completely incoherent and seemingly improvised script! Production values ​​are extremely low and technical issues are pathetic, but the amounts of violence and free sex can not be described. The film opens in a tropical sunny location called Warriors Island, where a shocking monk's band raises deaths for no apparent reason than to turn them into Kung Fu fighters. Monks also buy sexy slaves from a Hitler businessman, rather amazed, because the body of women provides them with the necessary powers to increase their zombie army. Tourists on a cruising ship, including three martial arts fighters, a female LA policeman and a bunch of daring but daring ladies, are attacked by Hitler's nuns for planning a trip to Warriors Island . Their rescue boat washed the island anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors to a zombie battle test. Okay, how does that sound like a crazy horror movie? It's not over yet, because "Raw Force" also has piranhas, wild boar orgy, Cameron Mitchell in another embarrassing role, and Camille Keaton's explosive ruler ("I spit on your grave"), a very insignificant aspect. There are a lot of bad gore accomplished, including ax and behead massacres, chocolate jokes and unpleasant romance. The garbage value of this film will literally leave you speechless. The backdrop of wicked monks remains, of course, inexplicable, and they are not even punished for their questionable hobbies. Maybe that's why the movie stops with "To Be Continued" instead of "The End". The continuation never came, if it is not so obscure IMDb does not even list it.
