If Deborah Messing had not already been expressed as "Grace," it could be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated frustrated spinster who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) that she reads in an article in Time magazine to travel to London for her sister's wedding in London. How new is this plot? It's neither fun nor romantic, Wedding Date sneaks over the story of deceptive sex by the bride and the best man, and pays for escorts to get off the film like Four Weddings without Hugh and certainly a business deadly for the na√Øve groom who does not know the bride's sexual history (Amy Adams). While Messing perfected the repressed princess, 30, a woman with a history of unsuccessful relationships, her neurotic and drunken mothers move into another faux beau is simply restoring her television series. If this woman is an actress, take a role that does not rehash what is already on time prime. A lot of drunken female ties, cricket visual jokes, and Mulroney in a towel (nice!) But the movie is a play with obvious happy ending. The following message is expected: divorce date.
