This movie was simply bad. Almost any movie in police movies is present and reckoned. A bad guy leaves? Check it out. Partner? Check it out. Wacky personality conflict with your partner? Check it out. Rookie with something to prove? Check it out. Rookie looks veteran grizzled. Check it out. The only thing he did not touch was an idiot shooting and retiring, but I think he saves those old chestnuts for Dooley's next exit. Add to the Battle of Gender with Girl Power along with the old tired old gags and trivial overdone material that Dooley's award car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for a very bad movie. Avoid this at any cost.
