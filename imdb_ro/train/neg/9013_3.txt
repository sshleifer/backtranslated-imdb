It's hard to praise him a lot. CGI for the dragon was well made, but it did not have a proper modeling for light and shade. Also, the same images are used without interruption by the dragon running through corridors that become slightly tiring. I was amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the action credits, wondering what a former Emperor of the novel Empire was doing in this movie! Just like "Whoopie Goldberg" must be a pseudonym, and maybe someone blames him to use one if he appears in this stinker. The story might be interesting, but the act is flat and the direction is tedious. If you have to watch this movie, go to your friend's house and be drunk while doing this - then it will be nice.
