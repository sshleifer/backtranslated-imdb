According to IMDb, as well as to all other sites that have a review; this "thing" does not have a director. Well, that would explain a lot! Just a bunch of people who gathered to shoot some perverted pornographic sequences and throw an ultra-thin story about devil sacrifices and women inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium. "Hardgore" is a prime example of total bleeding of 70 years, as is indeed done with a minimum of production and inspirational scriptic values. Horror films about satanic cults were extremely popular in the early 70s and pornography, why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac who engages in a mental asylum, and from the very first night she is drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Indeed, a lot of dildo-action. The friendly lesbian assistant tries to warn her, but she has her neck cut in the same night. Horror aspects are really poorly crafted, ranging from fearless Satan masks to virulent penis attacks. Photos and acting shows are almost gullible, but what do you expect from a movie containing images of sperm burning dildos and talking about male amputated reproductive organs? Lady Justna Lynn is a fairly good girl with a glamorous body, but most of her co-stars (men and women) are terrible and exaggerated hair balls.
