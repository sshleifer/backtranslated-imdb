I have seen four other Japanese horror movies and have not been impressive. However, I could feel that there is a sensitive scenario indicating the path. Not here, in any case. It's a detective trying to connect similar crimes that have happened. When he finds a suspect in the question, the suspect gets angry because he keeps a ghost. Then the ghost starts to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes more than half of the movie. Pretty bad? Oh no. The film keeps the perspective of switching to different characters that do not have much to do with the story. I have seen this in other films, where it shows another perspective. This is not the case here. Also, anything that happens on the screen, which is actually tolerable, ends quickly. For example, there are some scenes with a small instrumental score that accumulates and then cuts to another scene. I know this can be a dramatic effect. This is certainly not the intention here. It's just a bad editing. Finally, there is a "ghost" that shouts only in a way that is not frightening or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and it happens very much throughout the movie. All the spirits have been made before, in better ways, so that you can see them all coming. Then after one of them, the movie is over. At that moment, a wave of confusion went over the audience, as I could feel that we all felt that we were wasting our time. Someone made a sting and the laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put it, YOU.
