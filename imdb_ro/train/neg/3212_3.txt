I'm a great fan of the comic series, but this movie has fallen far below my expectations. I've been expecting Metal Heavy 2000 to feel a little like ..... in slow motion, a stupid dialogue, a lot of blood ..... but that was worse than anything I could have imagined . <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points stop pretty much there. Characters do not have the energy or spirit that caught my attention in the comic series. The film covers only a small part of the comic, and the portion used is slower and more boring than the later parts. The film focuses on insignificant events, instead of the more interesting plot of the comic book. With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Unfortunately, it was not so, so there is now another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will certainly collect dust for years until I throw it away.
