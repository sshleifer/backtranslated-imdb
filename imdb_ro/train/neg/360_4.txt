I read the book and I really liked it from the beginning to the end. However, when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. First of all, no disrespect for Deborah Raffin, but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. Also, Christopher Reeve's delay was also mistaken - the same reason. It will be, according to the book, about 30 years old. I would like to see a less exploration of his military life, his Red friend, of Elly's journey to see him as an important part of character story development. Miss Beasley was also mistaken while the book mentions she is a Plus Size lady. I know the movie did not have the budget of "Madison County Bridges", which I think was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me, this movie was a very poor, low-budget, miscast movie. As somebody mentioned, I want Miss Spenser to retire and write scenarios for her books as it should be. He knows his characters better than anyone, I hope he will also consider distribution. The film left me down!
