Updating the Bliss theme is just the latest in a queue of prolonged bad and medium comedies that appeal to the conservative cinema set. (To record this list, all the films that seem to try a miracle in Castle-esque include Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Oule, Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes, and The Nugget to be Crackerjack. ) Here, the shows never mesh, as John Howard does not even look like he is in the right film? though this was probably the intention, as Franklin plays the sleepy, conservative suburban against his more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old Virginians who live with their parents are becoming more and more rare on the screen, but this is not a reason to watch the movie. In fact, the only reasons could be (1) Howard bizarre? but quite fun? (2) The theme of the "suburban nightmare" that passed through Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Lake Placid, Travel Light, Teesh & Trude, of which they are very good / excellent. Enter your own risk! It can be one for people who play the word "penis." 4/10.
