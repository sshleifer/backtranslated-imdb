If I checked IMDb Before renting this DVD from Netflix, I would have had a few hours of my life back. I am sincerely suspicious when I see the director of a movie writing it too. In this case, according to the credits, the same type was "writer and director" - unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded her of her early comedy routines that saddled Judy-ism), which made me write these two stars rather than one. But these moments were few and far between ... and I almost did not see them, because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention the condemnation of violence. I admit that I came back to look at that part again to see if I lost something to help me figure out after seeing everything. No, although I recognized at least who the characters would prove to be important later. The "camera" technique has been used too much and, in essence, unnecessary. I woke up talking with the TV screen: "What ?!" or "For the good of the sake, put it with him!" Not recommended.
