Lies, my friends and I saw the movie based on the title alone. It's cute, though obviously in the plot and in its direction ... you know where the movie will unfold in the first five minutes. My main objection to the plot is that while it remains tolerant, it never explains many things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overweight mother, a stressed sister ... is a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of the sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused about the bottle scene ... it seemed quite random. Writing is a secondary concern ... the children were not bad actors, but their script has left much to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single special effect, bla, lame scripting and an obvious obvious plot.
