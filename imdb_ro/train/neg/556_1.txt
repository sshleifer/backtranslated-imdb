In my book, "Basic Instinct" was a perfect film. He had a remarkable action on the parts of Stone, Douglas, and the actors who had played him the smallest role. He had a great photo, music, and the most noir scenario ever. All this adds to a movie that is as good as ever! This sequel is exactly the opposite, can not do worse, badly acting and a blade script, combined with an inept direction, this is very bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that takes care of you is the relatively short expectation for the next scene, which is a true copy of the original. These children are so sorry that they make you laugh and laugh a lot, in spite of me, because it was like watching the demolition of a brilliant monument. The only good thing about this awful mess is the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the screenwriter have even included the "There is no smoking in this space" dialog on the interrogation scene and yes, she sends his lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this terrible movie that should never have happened! It has original damage, so it's bad. The only redemption value is the fact that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs. Stone offered the best money the surgeon can buy) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And what about the human body applies to filming. There should be a law: never make a perfect movie!
