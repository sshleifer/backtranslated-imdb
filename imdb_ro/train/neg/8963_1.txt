The crimes in this movie are not that bad, but surely the movie is. It's even worse than that. It does not even deserve the wear it can cause when you slide it into the DVD player. Even the wear on the shoulders does not wear it on the DVD store, not to mention the money and the time spent renting and watching. Horrible. It's beyond understanding how someone can say something positive about this movie. It was just a pure masochist trend of mine that made me stop forgetting, adding to it the group's pressure from my co-observers. The manuscript is awful, the direction is even worse and the act is simple, clever. I hope you do not see this as a destruction of your entertainment, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: do not waste your time tracking this trash!
