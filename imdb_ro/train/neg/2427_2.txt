Do not get me wrong, I like actions and revenge movements, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's last "The Mechanik," which is pretty good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and even could be a shooting genius and movie editing. But with "The Man on Fire" (and even more with "Domino"), Scott shows that rather than using his "genius" filming skills intelligently, he uses it tremendously to show and compensate the lack of substance that his materials do not offer. The "fireman" is almost two and a half hours when it should have been at least an hour less. The way Scott shot and edited this movie makes you wonder if he really wants the audience) to stay in his movie because his camera constantly moves and blinks is really an eye torture and makes you let his theater stop him in 5 minutes. MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes about PG-13 ratings, violence, and movies, I think it's suspicious, and that a $ 70 million movie is made up of a B movie screenplay with a fingering character, blows a guy's hand with a rifle, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who is NOT even dead! Give him the picture of why a studio will get a better script because of language or violence ... That's what he said ...
