The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies in the '90s. The second one was just as funny with the same comments and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how he could go on with the same story, considering that Kevin would have been 17 in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes a child as annoying and makes him sick. Is the child 6 years old and mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of burgers are these idiots? I do not want to go into detail if you want to see this movie unfortunately. But please, I would recommend not to be away from her. It's not worth your precious time. Go bend a piece of paper, do things, balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap! It is better to then look at "Home Alone 3"! 1/10
