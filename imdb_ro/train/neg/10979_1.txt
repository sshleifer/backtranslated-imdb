Words can not begin to describe how terrible this movie is. I wanted to be "so bad that it's good", but it's not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I could not even laugh at her. In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the culmination of the film. The only less charismatic person is director Brett Kelly, who, as a true affirmation of vanity, was cast into a man's head. Both of them looked like bastards, sister and brother. Gaul, Sherry Thurig, is a viewer. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and brilliant and can act. Although you can say he's back. All actors seem to hold on, especially the man who supports her, Mark. I saw less wood in a rain forest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep the actors not to go? Is that a director so bad? All the others have completely summed up the story - there is not one. The kids are kidnapped and Kelly takes steps to solve the crime. I know how he felt in poo, so I felt after watching his movie. Yeah, I tried to get my money out of the rental shop. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the director's friends (and if you look for them, you will see that the same friends were the ones who gave the positive signs of the film).
