There's a lot to be appreciated here: spectacular locations and flight sequences; antique suits, props and sets; and writing and acting competent. However, in order to enjoy a drama, we need at least one director who presents certain qualities that we may want or admire. In this bunch of snobbish, did we find a single character that is not at all enjoyable? a wretched man enrolled in a peripheral role as a victim helpless passerby. From the comments here, it is clear that we are completely out of the way, but we have not found that their behavior is badly amusing or entertaining. Even the dog is detestable. I dropped the towel after two of the six episodes, so I should reduce those observations properly, but what we could find about this mini-series did not give us any reason to expect the transformation or redemption of the characters.
