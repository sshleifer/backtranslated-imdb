This film is a prime example of squandering big resources in a movie. You will have future SNL and SCTV stars such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, basically making 70 minutes of gross, unassisted and racist jokes. The network concept of the undermining future society could have been really taken to some exciting extremes, but instead of going out of the gate, make a joke, juvenile proctological joke, and stay in that direction of humor in all sorts. much more subversive and duo groove Tube or later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Film. This film is intended only for those who want to see a time capsule of sketch comedy films.
