I got this at the video store because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like it, go to yourself") on the box ... it seemed like a call approval ... I was expecting something more like that with "Proof of Death" ... not real violence in this case, nor plot, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. Everything is there. Stunts, and rock. She goes back and forth. About a week in the life of an LA band performing a magical show at a level you might see in one of the smaller Strip casinos and a new Aussie stunt in the city that finds its feet ... They work, meet the girls, they happen. The end of the story. The band needed all of these things because they are sincere second level and have played a style that has already been dated in 1978. It has to be said that the stunts of the film are really spineting - that the Aussie is really something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for "art." I hang it there to see what a mad thing she would do next. Just want to find a better vehicle.
