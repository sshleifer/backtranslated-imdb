Once the big star action that fell off the face of the earth ends in a small town with a problem with drug traffickers and a cadet of a federal agent. Reuniting with some former co-stars to clean the city. <br /> <br /> Low key, often to the point of kindness, the "action" comedy mostly simply does not work. Part of the problem is the distribution of Chris Klien as a former action hero. it's not bad, but it's not really credible like a man who was considered to be a tough guy. As I said it's not bad, he's just a fool for what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is really not funny and sometimes seems artificial, and the direction that is pedestrian at the port of monotony. There is no life in the way things are set. It's like the director had a list of photos and went on that list. Makes a tireless movie. Still, the film occasionally comes back to life, like the one in the last show that ends the film. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie have slammed its powers. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend the movie. It is worth a shot if you are a fan of actors or you are a great fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
