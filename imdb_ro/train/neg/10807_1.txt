This film has successfully demonstrated what we all know, that professional basketball players aspire to everything outside of basketball. Especially rap and action. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie is. First of all, is it just me, or is the most ugly child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even if he has magical powers, sucks terribly to make music? Third, I read the Bible. In no way or form did he say that Jesus made the genius. Fourth, what was the problem with all the special effects? I assure you that any adolescent adolescent with a computer with acne can have better effects than this one. Fifth, why is it so bad? And what the hell is a djinn? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam must be thrown off a plane and on the Eiffel Tower as this film takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
