The film seemed to appeal to the new Pokemon Celeb. But the plot was not of course an interest in other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same humor corny and bad guys. The movie was of no use to do if you want to make the Pokemon famous. The movie should not be better associated with animes, such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and settings do not rise to the original anime. It's a shame to even talk about this movie. I bet the Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and will give up the Pokemon. Digimon is more an anime and does not fall anywhere near Pokemon. The second film is released at the end of 2002.
