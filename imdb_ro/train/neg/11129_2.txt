Watch the 1936 version. As personal annoying, I find Charles Boyer's voice, he is more like a match to pay cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharif tries, but not - too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp), besides being too old, does not show anything like Marie - nothing! She seems too sophisticated to even think of death because she loved this man in such a manner. The only actor in the entire film to convey the role he plays is Ava Gardner whose portrait of Empress Elizabeth is quite short on the screen (and queen's quest is more than a passing resemblance) as a historian, Empress Elisabeth was not involved long in Rudolf's life.
