All the naked women in the chest in the world could not stop me from hitting the stop button for a third of the way through this terrible garbage. With disturbing action, the script is just as terrible, plus the bad CGI FX to fit it; this film is an insult to the genre Vrcolac. It's supposed to be serious, which would be funny if this movie could even be at the level of being a bad joke. This is one of those movies where the people behind the room are obviously competent, but they are too lazy to do something even a decent quarter. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 of 10!
