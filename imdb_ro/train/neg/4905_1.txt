I'm usually disappointed with the movies on the network. Even films that attract big-name actors are usually ruined by television people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The scenario is weak and the action, especially Tracey Pollan's, is abominable. I struggled to see my kids' school games and I was treated to act better. Pollan behaves as if he is reading the script as he speaks. When he tries to express fear, anger or pain, he is extremely naked. Because of the overall quality of production, it has been hard for me to take it seriously. If you decide to courage yourself, you must be prepared for great disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romanticism will not make you feel warm and steady, and you will probably be as anxious as I wanted to see the end end up. "First of Death" tells a lot about this movie.
