I'm not a big fan of slash-like filming as a genre, but even by low-budget operating standards, it's really blades. Even on a level of nudity and gore, it is incredibly boring (there are some of the two, but everything is ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not even have been theatrically launched (though it might, after all, have the 9th Planetary Space Plan in the theaters). There is just a good line (and well supplied) throughout the film; I suppose they stole it somewhere. The actor is among the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had some competent actors, and the others tended to be weird, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of its actors could go as long as letters. Here, those who do not read their lines like the Indians in the cigarette shop sound like they taught it phonetically. And this film has only one distinction: manages to be badly underdeveloped for most of the movie, then upset with annoyance for the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have named her actress who plays the receptionist exception, she is never wood, not good, but certainly not wood.) Even the most serious blows the slasher are generally good for some Puritan meditations in connection with their grotesque offensive, but with this, there does not even seem to be anything to do a moral revolt. And you know what's funniest? They clearly expect to continue! It's so bad and boring that it gets fascinating in a weird way. I felt mostly annoyed by the film asking why someone would go to the trouble of doing so.
