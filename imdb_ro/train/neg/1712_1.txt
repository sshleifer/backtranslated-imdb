If Todd Sheets were to come and admit that this movie was meant to trick the genre of zombies, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie where every scene, line and even any hue was designed to be a parody. I may probably be able to eat alphabet soup, rearrange what's left of the letters and have a better script. Two scenes especially come to mind when I think about this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other father go, repeat travels on a zombie stairwell blockade. This is a small scale, and although it is cleared of oysters, nothing happens to it. When they get to the end, the ex-marin returns, says, "Lord, you're a horny bastard," and shoot just one. The other is in the military complex. The girl spoils a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around for about forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at a distance from one arm. Then, almost necessarily, he leaks out of the crowd and joins the other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. However, I like this movie as much as any comedy just because it's so funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets for having received so many people in his film and being urged to do so, but not for anything else.
