Big distribution. Great action. The unpredictable story line for the first half hour <br /> or so. I really wanted to know what would happen to each of these unrecognizable characters and that the way they seem to be disparate will be interconnected. But when the writers took off the glue to start connecting players, they misused a super glue and brought the film to a standstill. <br /> <br /> for the last two hours. I thought it would do better, but it just got worse. Do not believe the reviews. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think - Tom Cruise did ugly - why? The gorgeous barman wearing brace - why? I know it has to do with the plot, but without them, at least there would have been an attractive member to remember.
