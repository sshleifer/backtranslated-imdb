This movie was made for television, so with that in mind, I will not do it as hard as a feature film. The script is sub-par, but manages to be slightly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The act is largely over-top, but this is true for many smaller budget movies. The look of this movie I really hate, however, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places it will be 5-10 seconds if the movie is shot on video. You can say that there is lower contrast, colors are less vivid, and images are clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second of the film. I'm not sure if these scenes had to be shot later, and at that time they did not have the money to film on film (I guess that's why anyway), but it's disoriented and really does the film look than she had to look . Anyway, I've certainly seen worse movies, but I certainly would not say I liked this movie and I can not recommend someone to see it.
