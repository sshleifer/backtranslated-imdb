This fantastic fusion of the New Age movie and the bad movie movie could not "open" you, borrow one of the movie's favorite verbs, but it might leave you jaw and your belly laugh at you. Based on James Redfield's best-selling book, published in 1993, this kitsch hornbock follows the spiritual awakening of a professor of American history (Matthew Settle) who, on his trip to the deepest, darkest air something else more illegal. And what he discovers is a lazy Shangri La populated by smiling zombies that can be nuts or just a lot of medication, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a blooming panpipe and an occasional cry from a heavenly chorus. Although it is too much about energy, that quality is certainly missing from the motley piece, including Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly removed from the pantheon of the camp. For those who care, the plot involves the military, the terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni offered the inept direction, while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the song of a script. In short, the slightly worst movie seen in over 40 years of watching movies.
