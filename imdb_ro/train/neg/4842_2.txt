Who did the research for this movie? It is established in Baghdad in 2004, however, all soldiers carry ACUs and have all the Universal camouflage tools. Nobody ever wore those things in 04. I just saw this movie as they unfold abroad and can I say that the overwhelming feeling on the part of the public was the WTF? This movie made no sense, they had characters that came with no explanation, and people made ridiculous things that would NOT happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but obviously trying to present something realistic. She does not get miserable, but she tries. <br /> <br /> It is as if someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed them and swallowed, then shed a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I stayed everywhere. GI Joe was one that made you think about it. STAY AWAY!
