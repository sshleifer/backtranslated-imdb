I saw this movie at a "preview" and I must honestly admit that I do not like the movies with Meryl Streep very much. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the half-time break. I could not blame them, if it was not a true story, it was not absolutely necessary a second half of the painting. Even before the movie went on for about ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
