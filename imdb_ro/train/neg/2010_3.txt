Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to get the dog ... I can not believe I looked at everything. I think we anticipate optimistic that it will be better. Horrible speech of dissemination, pathetic action, and unlikely events. Like Toby's mother who clutches when she takes Col to climb up and back into a room with a 24-degree ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything around her body in still motion, which would be he could use it to climb. The little girl who played the last family's daughter was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was the second. The basic story has a good potential and a good script, and a director might be a serious creepy movie, but this version is unfortunately not the case. It scares me more when I open my bill every month.
