There seems to be little in the way of the middle ground where Watch On the Rhine is worried. One likes him very much, applauding his sincerity, his liberal point of view and his fine acting, or losing obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters, and general tendency. I fell a lot in the last category and found the film and the play - about the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - a crushing boredom, it is especially worth doing and even then intermittently. This author, Lillian Hellman, was on the angels' side is irrelevant. Her songs were written for people who shared their point of view, and she rarely explored ideas that have not already been supported by the author and the public, except to point out how horrible the "other side" is. Even when I find myself in a hundred percent agreement with what she has to say, as in Rin, I still can not stand as she says. Her characters are unreal and while her dialogue ear shows a certain facility for how people talk that they do not possess any real glow or originality. He had nothing to say. I totally agree with Mary McCarthy's late resignation, which was demonstrated a few years ago by Hellman's reputation. For those who think the theater is dead or in extreme and traveling for good times, I want a look at the Rhine Clock, just as bad as the angels in America, which only shows that the theater has one leg in the tomb now sixty years.
