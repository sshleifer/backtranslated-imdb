I wanted to register my men in white so I could look again. "What? Did you enjoy Theo?" again to see if he was just as retarded, stupid, and madly as unhappy as I remember him. Many people claimed it was made for children. Can I suggest that it was made by children? because the entire structure of the script has no discipline on the part of producers and writers and many of the pieces seem to have been included because they seemed a good idea at that time does not help, but I really started to feel sorry for them. Honestly, you can think that during the filming, the cast had to lie to their families to shoot a hard porn movie, so it was their embarrassment that they had to appear in something so subtle. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the act is every time BAYWATCH boy, Donna D'Ericco, has disappeared from the story, I patiently waited for it to reappear after a few seconds later I forgot it was in the movie. I understand ? A star from BAYWATCH appears and a few seconds later you will forget it's in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the white men's standard. He is fairly trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES (although DISMALS would be a better adjective for this film), although perhaps the movie deserves a credit because it never comes down to the toilet, but given that this is a children's movie (this did not stop ITV from broadcasting at 11 o'clock) then there should be no humor around it
