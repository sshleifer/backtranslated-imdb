I should have trusted my instinct better: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, I expected a similar masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is not in my humble opinion but a cheap attempt to make money for the success of his predecessor's cult, and from an artistic point of view he fails at all. It seems that a producer has gathered the remaining material of Koyaanisqatsi, hastily threw it, put everything in motion and received a pop entertainment artist under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurry up banal background music repeats incessantly. If Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with quick and slow smart changes, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of slow-moving pictures (if you see them on the VCR in quick preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me most, however, was the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not - and still can not - believe that these New Age drones, which could have been easily composed on an afternoon by any 14-year-old boy on a Casio computer, were from the same composer wonderful combination of emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget about commercialism! Look at Koyaanisqatsi again!
