This movie has a lot of great adult stars, but it fails to interest you in a way you should an adult film. Of all the stars you could not take your shots off any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream, like the middle-aged set, which is shameful. The actor is worse than Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are as interesting as listening to neighborly talk about their child in college, and the dialogue is the worst I've ever seen in a movie. Also, the plot was worse ten times. I would turn to the amateur route. The audio comment was useless because it is a blow to the skin, but even then it was bad. Unless you're your Jenna Jameson fan, there's not much here. 4/10
