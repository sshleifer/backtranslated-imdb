It is supposed to be a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in rural areas in the late 1970s, and the "Nightmare" is full of stereotypical southern stereotypes with full accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most South Americans, this hard work is just a thin film of "babe in jail" - especially in its original version. However, the action is generally superior to the average, and Chuck Connors in particular does a good job of making the viewers hate it - though it seems to be uncomfortable in several scenes. There is also a rhythm shift role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as lecherous guard, and Tina Louise (former Ginger of Gilligan Island) has made a rather credible prison guard. My degree: D. <br /> <br />
