I can always say when something will be a success. I see or hear, and get a good feeling. I did not have a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all excited about this movie and I am not surprised at being considered here as one of the worst 100 movies. In fact, I was right. The first thing that threw me was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebony (I'm black on the road), but for a movie it could have used a better title and for this time it uses a title that has no bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, I saw the role of actor, and all I could do was face up. I also think the theme of the dance film is outdated. At least "You were served" was better than that in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not scare me.
