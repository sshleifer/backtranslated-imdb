One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define "worst?" I'd rather have two eyeballs and be forced to dance on them than to ever see this offensive again. Somewhat, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie that offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay vendors, Las Vegas, homosexuals, FBI agents and the rest of humanity, with any information with an unpleasant, helpless farce that deserves to be abandoned. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the current Elvis songs rights to be used in a movie with a central premise that seems to be "The Only Good One Elvis Presley The Immortal Is Dead" is beyond me. The worst part of this misery - and that's what it is - is the mongol script: In 1958, Elvis's words and songs he would speak / interpret in the 1970s are quoted! The worst special effect? The Oscar would go to the tomb that decided that Elvis's tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognized tomb in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record on the top and is located in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, the biggest audience of this film would be Elvis fans. However, aggressive stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not the FBI credentials ... and I could go on), in fact, subverts HERE the conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid film. This is really a terrible, horrible movie.
