I read Chris_m_grant's commentary from the United States. He wrote: "A fantastic documentary from 1924. This geography of the twentieth century in Iraq today was strong." <br /> <br /> I thank Chris and the people who are interested in Nomads of Bakhtiari in Iran, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie "Grass, A Nation's battle for life". These traditions you have seen in the movie have lasted for centuries and will continue as long as life persists. I am from this region of Iran. I'm a Bakhtiari. Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Iraq as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and distinct countries. Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like getting an American for a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Shit
