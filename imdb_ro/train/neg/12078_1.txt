I literally fell asleep three times watching this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare and this takes a certain mentality to be interested or not. But this film goes beyond any barrier to long soliloquies and what not, which can prevent many not to take care of a story based on Shakespeare. The biggest obstacle to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often during the interaction of the character, it is almost difficult to distinguish between the lines who are who he is. Granted, I think this movie is called in English. Of course, they could have got vocal actors who could have added a bit more drama to these classical, literary lines. It would be difficult to evaluate this film more than 1, although it is likely to be based on age biases and what would seem to be a very low budget. However, it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
