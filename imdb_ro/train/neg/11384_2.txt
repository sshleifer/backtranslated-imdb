Ever since Europe began fighting World War II, by the end of the war, Hollywood (with significant implications from the government) made tons of films that were designed to try to make young people enrolled in the army, serviceman appear "cool". This is by far the sloppy, which means that a soldier's life is labor-free, you get the best food, and you go to stretch all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in the Second World War, but I think it was more than that. There is the best cat witch in a plot and a bunch of musical numbers that show some of the most important actions of the day. I think that by 1943, even the most naive of civilians knew there were more overseas than the noisy robberies portrayed in this film. While I'm sure it was supposed to be regarded as escapist entertainment, I can not think if the family and the loved ones who fought at war were amused or rejected by this trivialization of the sacrifice of their loved ones.
