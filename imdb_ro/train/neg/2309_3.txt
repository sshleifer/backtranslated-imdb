I have a great deal of tolerance for the weird ones, but honestly, some movies go on the road, beyond strange - so far, that I'm bad for the brain. This is such a movie. Trying to understand or even explain this is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs - it's incomprehensible. The movie starts with a very nice Japanese animation involving a cat. However, from blue, there are many tons of twisted and sometimes disturbing things - making me wonder if I lose something in translation. However, even so, why did we have to be treated to images of a magic trick that involves breaking a lady with intelligence, defecation, swelling, burning the animals on fire, etc. All this seemed random and quite terrible. Strange, and I do not know why, some see this as a genius work. I do not understand.
