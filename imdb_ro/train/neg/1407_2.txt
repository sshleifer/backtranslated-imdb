After life is a miracle, I did not expect too much. It's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as, for example, Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is two hours of madness, without a story. Underground's wild, unbridled humor seems to have degenerated here into a pathetic envy. It seems that Kusturica has been steadily going down since she started making affective comedies, beginning with Black Cat, White Cat, which she thought was great, but she already had disturbing signs of dementia. I liked the first movies so much, so it's particularly disappointing to see this. Let's hope its next one will be great.
