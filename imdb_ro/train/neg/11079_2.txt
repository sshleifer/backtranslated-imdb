Over the course of a few years, looking for decent half-lent movies for my children, I developed a sixth sense to see the really-direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit anyone over the age of eight). I gave up this ball and the kids spent half of the movie asking me "why did he say that?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes were inflamed from running every minute or so the characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random changes to the plot. And next time someone decides that he has absolutely no skill with a sword is simply "bringing realism" to a movie, please run them with a lump butter bite. "Prehysteria" was head and shoulders above. Ouch.
