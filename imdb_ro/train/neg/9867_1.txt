He saw a scenario this year before last year's awarding season, he did not really know why they kicked out after the vote was over, but, perhaps, for the exposure, at least, but the movie was a complicated mess . Of course, some parts were fun in some kind of black humor, but none of the characters seemed real to me. There was not one person to connect to, and I think he did not succeed for me. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive to Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... to see if it was not already drawn to the point of futility. The whole experience feels false, from enlightenment, from pouring to horrible visual effects (which is supposed to be intentional, I can say the same and others do not laugh at you). Anyway, I hope it's the best-selling DVD, I would not have wanted a project that a lot of people obviously made a lot of effort to become completely unnoticed. But it is in any case. That's boring.
