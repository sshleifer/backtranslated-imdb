David Lynch took brutal and crude from South Park presents a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about suburban middle class families. The father is a horrible monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular hole, of which the most terrible gutural noises are spoken, the son and mother are always terrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A series of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series. Lynch is not famous for his comedies (for example, on Air, aspects of Wild in Heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedies in general. However, there were some scenes in Dumbland, which made me laugh out loud. There are smart bits of animated cinema - where Lynch transmits numerous reactions to his characters through a syntactic arrangement of photographs, unlike face expressions (which never fluctuate in Dumbland). I think Lynch is really trying to give his audience a lively animation, even disturbing, animated here. Interestingly, he chose to follow the footsteps of the recent humor of ultra-humor (that is, most of Will Farrell's films) adding elements of vicious social criticism and classical violence to cartoons and brutal humor. While mixing does not work very well here, there is nothing if not Lynchian. It's worth seeing Lynch's fans.
