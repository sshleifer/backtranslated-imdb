The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This film is not Cabarnet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other commentators that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation, which we now enjoy in the sit-com and the dialogue is sprinkled and preached. But let's look at the outdated theme of the movie. With the passing of sixty years of history comes wisdom. From the Rin Clock, author Lillian Hellman was exposed as plagiarism at Bidenesque with her story about real life "Julia" in his book "Pentimento." Being one of the most courageous of a lot of Western-based Western apologists, it is obvious that her theme in play and film was to make the American act to save Stalin's bloody Soviet dictator and international communism at fascists, their military supremacy in Spain. As a commentator observed, this is not a pro-American piece and a movie because Lillian went to the grave, an American communist who does not like it. This film chronicles the usual stupidity of the intellectual elites that make up the American Left, as now the full longevist on the left, The Daily Kos and Michael Moore, bought in conspiracy theories and again helped and comfort those who destroy America.
