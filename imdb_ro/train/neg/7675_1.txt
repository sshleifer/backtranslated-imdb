Can we ever say there are films that have no redeeming aspect? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After helping the director of "House of the Dead", Uwe Boll, he dropped the less talented yet another adaptation to video games. It is not like that? For anyone who can not understand, here is for you in block capitals: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT DO FOR GOOD FILMS! Action here is, at best, under-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which had the scary moments), the film does not have an imminent doom atmosphere, no sense of danger or threat. Stimulation and plotting is confusing, and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The principal guilty is the director. Uwe Boll uses the room with the grace and skill of a monkey using a brush. Zombies, swoops and pans are joined in all the miserable adventure at unpredictable moments, leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy has ever been left next to a film first established must stand as one of the most modern modern cinemas. Avoid at all costs.
