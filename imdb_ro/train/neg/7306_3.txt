Really one of the boldest movies I've ever had. Never gave me time to write one of these things, but I felt compelled to see this affront in filming and feel somehow injured that I wasted my time on such a piece of turd to be honest. There have been so many parties that have fed me with their complete dizziness and lack of meaning (for example, when police forces have ever fired people with infectious diseases?) When hospitals would sell such people for lack of a cure? spying on his wife jumping out in the dress while carrying a gun as he rolled on the bed?). Also, the characterization - as we almost expected in such films - was terrible (for example, the way the blonde guy - I do not remember his frickin name and never give it a throw - turned completely against his girlfriend and fled to leave her) and I came to want everyone to meet with terrorists! The production was horrible and the cinema did not write anything about it.
