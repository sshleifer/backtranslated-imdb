I did not agree with any theology in the "Behind the Left" series, but still I found the books stuck and I read 8 out of 12. Undoubtedly good writing and interesting story. However, we did not have great expectations for the film. There was no way that the main Hollywood would have picked up a number of Christians and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently ... and I felt I was looking at a really long television show. It just did not feel like a movie; did not have the "experience" of the movie if someone knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of this, and the special effects with a low and low budget were another diminution for me. In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was miserable like Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of the NC was that it should have been this charming, dazzling, amazingly beautiful guy who spoke English with almost every accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken Pencil Pencil that looks like a Best Buy month employee and gave her a fake accent. So I lost a few stars for me right there. A movie is not convincing when the big villain does not sound or sound the way he should do. The act was fine, but he did not write anything at home. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I do not remember which one) - were true squirming chairs for me. And some of the rock rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes, as if Kirk Cameron was praying in the bathroom. In short, it was not a bad movie, but it just did not. Stick to the book, folks, it's a lot better.
