I gave a movie to 2, and though I think I was a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously. He was at AMC late at night and I'm glad I saw him freely. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. The special effects are about average for the time - not terrible, but not great. Of course, we know more about Mars now than we did then, but we really can not take this film into consideration. The main reason why I did not like this movie is because of the story. There were a few parts of this movie that I would have liked to have explored in more detail - the astronaut's damage / condition, the city of Mars, the lake creature, etc. Generally, the film is much like a long-lasting episode of the 1960s exterior version - complete with a cheesy finish.
