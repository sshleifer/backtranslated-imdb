I'm sure people watching this move outside Britian this movie will be an entertainment watch, but someone in the UK is painful in his mistakes. Right at the beginning of the movie Elijah Wood becomes a tube from the bank, which was destroyed. He tells his sister, who meets: "What happened here," and she answers: "Oh Tottenham were in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham are already in the city ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight with other fans, the last place on earth that they would do is the Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere in the world. There are other similar mistakes, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the role of a hooligan. He clearly decided that it is not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opt for a fake Dick Van Dyke style that made my ears blood. It was stressed that the rest of his band had spoken as you would expect the West Ham fans to expect. This error made him incredible in the role and really broke the movie.
