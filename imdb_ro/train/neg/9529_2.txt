This 1977 movie has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who appear in the home of a wealthy Socialist Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to find help finding a home they do not find. But the two have other plans in mind when they find that George's wife is out of town, they get to take control of the residence by linking George, killing a delivery boy, destroying the place one night. Bizarre and disturbing film, but the two get there just to reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. Most will either not like them right away, or get caught up in this absurd movie after about 30 minutes in it. However, some even consider this a classic worship. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
