This movement is just as bad as it will come. I was forced to give him a 2 for the landscape. There are many wonderful Southwest photos, including many of Monument Valley, one of the most stunning locations in the US. It is also starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, a scene with Kris and the girl was filmed in a place called John Ford.
