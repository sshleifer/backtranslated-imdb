An average quality of the TV film, the whole story of the religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good "is not just the president of" Psychos R Us ", I am also a client.) Who has the control over a biochemical virus the virus from "The Rock"). Too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank thieves and government agencies trying to stop him (led by Wolf Larson impressive , caretaker, with the support of Fred Dryer), "the wrong place at the wrong time," the feminine man (Erika Eleniak forever) and "lived as an old man, but he died as a last-minute male" (Brandon Karrer). Has the background story to give sympathy to religious fanaticism (wife and son killed in a police raid a few years ago). <br /> <br /> Practically, a decent movie a day. The preferred line, by Ron Perlman, after he finds the vial of virus hidden in the split of Erika Eleniak: "A woman and her mystery." It deserves a rent.
