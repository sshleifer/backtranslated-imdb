I have to say that in my childhood I am very proud of many films I have rented. The exception being Theodore Rex. Discuss the stupid film of all time in each actor's CV. Can you imagine what a Whoopie fired agent must have said to connect to this stupid "Hey Whoop, you've ever seen the dinosaur show, yes, they make a movie out of it and you can see Germany!" After that, the agent this must have referred a lot to Star Wars. This movie was so bad that I imagined that Whoopie must have bought each copy of this movie and destroy it. I just wish she had done the same thing in my memory, because my sister is still shit because I watch that movie. I mean, I even admit that I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but that's what I have in mind as the worst of me, my childhood and the greatest rental regret in my life, and that was 16 years ago. I'm 24 years old now if you want to do math. Whenever I think of my worst record list, I do not even remember, because as a child rape, I'm trying hard to suppress that it ever happened. Whoopie fucks you, just be glad that people just recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as the worst of you lucky.
