It was a popular movie, probably because of the humor in it, of the fast moving story, of an underdeveloped character that closes all the noises, etc. Funny thing is that you probably could not make a movie with this title if you replaced someone but "white" like anything else that would be considered racist by the PC police. However, Woody Harrleson, as a white guy who turns out to be as good, if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as his main counterpart Wesley Snipes. /> Snipes had a lot of funny lines, can get down, giving a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not mind many people - is the extreme profanation here and the weakness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really nice, cute people in this movie. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a profane
