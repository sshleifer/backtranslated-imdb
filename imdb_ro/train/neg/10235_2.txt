The only reason I give her a 2 is that the filmography is so stylized nowadays that it has at least something to comment on. This movie is asinin. It's like many other 21st century home feeds. The gore is free and simply outrageous. I did not care about any of the characters, but I cared that some Christians were disturbed to lose their nonsense: I was crying for the money I spent, but my date and I left wisely after 40 minutes and I went to a neighboring theater to watch the adventure and fun of "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably received much appreciation from me simply because I endured the worst "Captivity" time 40 minutes.
