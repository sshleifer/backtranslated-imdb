The "math" aspect of this is just a trick to try to set this TV show apart from millions of other police representatives. The only way to redeem this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have fallen (indefinitely) after the Nordic exposure if he enrolled in this chic. <br /> <br /> The greed of the mathematical aspect of the show is encapsulated in an episode that collaborates with Lou Diamond Phillips (who only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damn.) To catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses a theory of "bubbles." So he gives this long explanation that if we saw the suspect in A, B and C, then we can use the "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. He does everything on a board, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can not remember). Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he actually took three points and picked a point right in the middle and said, "Okay, mathematically, here's most likely to find the fugitive." At one point, another character shows "Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin in which the guy lived." Is this math? Do not connect them even to f ** k ** g-points! This show reminds me of the mathematics with which we work in the banking field, which had a mathematical analysis that it could have done to "support" the points that everybody else has already agreed upon either by less complex analysis or by basic common sense. > <br /> It just looks - When you're a hammer, it all looks like a nail. I can not wait until the NUMB3RS team is attached to OSAMA ... They'll use the calculation, they'll call a bomb in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama, and they will not even scratch the five kids they use as human shields ... hey ... all about numbers. <br /> <br /> The show is totally absurd.
