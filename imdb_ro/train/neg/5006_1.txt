Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only do not despair each other to the point of contempt but have little or no redemption qualities to make an audience feel or resist any character. There are so bad films that they are good (Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and I'm really stupid (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This movie is barely tolerable, even if you are a rival MSTie talented (eg, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I'm pretty talented in this regard (because my mind is working all the time), for those who are not so talented in the MSTie riff, possibly in * this movie * you just want to pull your head , painfully aware of the film "Taboo" robbing you about an hour and twenty minutes you will not come back. Even my MSTie talents were not really right for this waste of time. The most boring aspect of this film is that * someone * has lit up green and / or funded it ... I've been renting "taboo" only for the normal talent Amber Benson, who obviously must have been blackmailed to make this film . I have another less known movie of her in my rental queue, reviews that I'd better read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinth mansion for its interior location.
