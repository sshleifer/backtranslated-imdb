Millie is a sowing. He marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a baby. Then he catches him with deception and divorces him ... but lets him keep the child he pretends to love. At the time, in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to help for her husband and wife, but she leaves the guy amazingly easy ... without any support ... what a sack! Later, when he has a friend and life seems pretty good, it turns out he's also a cheap! Wow, she has a hard time choosing men. As a result of these bad relationships, Millie is changing. Now she's a wild girl - doing her best to distract her from her luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter, whom she left earlier in the movie, is now 17 and strange fashion has never changed. An old friend of Millie (yes, he is another evil man!) Turns now to be the daughter's friend, but he has perfect models on it. Millie promises that if he touches his face, he'll kill him. Take a wild idea what's going on! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a confusing and often bizarre misery - like "Madam X," but much, much less focused. So many times Millie's motives and actions seem to make no sense. And the movie seems to have little of everything that's been thrown into it - as long as it supports the idea that all people are pigs. Unusual, but not particularly good.
