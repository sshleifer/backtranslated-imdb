A good idea, badly implemented. While this could account for 99% of SciFi channel movies, it really applies here. I like movies that slowly reveal a good story and I like action movies and I like all the main actors, so it would be great. However, despite some good actions, this film fails because of Bill Platt's writing and bad director. Another review made a good point to know where you are heading to get there. This movie does not. It's put together so casually that you know the words "second version" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is a scene that is completely useless and could be removed without anyone observing it. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you can cut from one car scene to the other and you never miss the useless scene in the middle. This movie also had an unusual habit of explaining a few details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "parcel" from the front. They also had the habit of interrupting an early struggle, probably just because they could not afford it. There are also some bad bad scenarios where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle that conveniently involves placing "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what * is * that?). I'm a fan of Shiri Appleby, watching this movie because it's okay. She manages to get out of the character "Roswell" a few times and make a great chicken (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he has ever done since playing Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. Overall, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.
