OK, my girlfriend and I hired the DVD and about 30 minutes in the movie, I changed a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie even more important, I'm interested in finding out what ends up with the eyes and decided either I need drugs to keep us informed of the "plot", either to end the pain right there and then to see something else. I opted for the latter. I liked "But I'm a cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, I'm sorry! I prefer definitely "D.E.B.S" "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire".
