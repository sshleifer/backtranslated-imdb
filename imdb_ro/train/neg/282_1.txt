What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox degraded to the meandering shit. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my list "to see" weekly and not just thanks to Jessica Alba. Unfortunately, the powers at Fox have decided to "fine-tune" plotlines. In 3 episodes of opening the season, I totally missed as a spectator (I did not even see Jessica Alba!). I discovered that the new characters added in the second season were too ridiculous and amateur. The new lines of plot have stretched the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season's episodes, they even slept and dreamed Max - if the first season said he could not sleep from a biological point of view. The narrative's morale (the one Hollywood never receives): If it works, do not screw it up with it! <br /> <br />
