I went to see her in the hope of good old Alice Entertainment. After I realized I would not get that, I saw it for a pretty good movie (in terms of shooting, and yes .. it was). But besides having a good quality of the movie, considering that I had watched movies all day, there was nothing good about this movie. Killed 42.Why were Tweedle Dee and Mudler's Duma and Scully, Serisouly, Who Can Reach For Me? Who can answer something terrible about this movie for me. I agree with who said it was just a long joke inside the staff. it seemed to be. Weakness, Mr. Carroll. I'm sorry somebody did that with his wonderful stories.
