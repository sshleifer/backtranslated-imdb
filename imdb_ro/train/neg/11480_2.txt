I saw this with my girlfriend after he mocked me while recording channels. I think we both hoped for a happy happy Christmas movie, but we were extremely disappointed. the actor playing the soldier seems to have emotion, his face looks the same, whether he is cutting his Christmas tree, sees the girl who likes to be kissed by her boyfriend, or when she is happy surprised by the girl he loves, he's a terrible actor , and at no point, none of us does anything but laugh at him. Then is the blond blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count points and deceive her boyfriend, what catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more points. So it's basically a story about a guy without emotions or feelings that falls for a guy who counts points and cheats on her boyfriend is as predictable as hers and really a waste of time, you do not gain anything by pursuing it, other than strange laughs, because everything is so corny. I like when the father says he's just eating fried potatoes and not French, and everyone laughs, that's the hillbilly attitude that this movie is about, in addition, if my daddy girlfriend beat me around like he did, I would say something or not, but not our veteran army, no sir, he lets everyone boss him. The film is what would have been the first blood, if John Rambo burned as the biggest wimp in the world.
