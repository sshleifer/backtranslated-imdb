I have argued with me whether to rent this or not. I always fear to rent something that I have never heard of (I do not remember this in theaters). Big distribution ... that was the top of the scale. In 30 minutes, I almost stopped. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but unbelievable. It gets worse only afterwards. Writers of this film could do little research about future projects if they want to make their films even less. Or it could just try to write something a little credible. I give a 3 ... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and a 2 in order to get so many good actors to accept to make this movie, despite having to read the script. God, this movie sucks.
