As a poker enthusiast, I was looking forward to seeing this movie - especially since it had Scotty Nyugen in it. Basically, Scotty Nyugens short spots in this movie are all he's going to do. <Br /> <br /> The characters are inappropriate and annoying, the soundtrack is terrible, and the plot, well, there is no one. I honestly received a headache and woke up reading the number of bar code on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was Bored. In fact, Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not have wasted $ 16 buying Ebay. Take it from me - Avoid 7 2 offsuit! Terrible. :(
