I despise horror movies, which is not a secret. No plot, bad action and a gallon of blood are the traps of these mistakes of cinema, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations are actually driving this garbage. (This special garbage was released directly-video, as I remember.) As I mention every other film would be a big insult to the other film, I say this: All Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy movies, Chucky Movies more of Michael Myers' films can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! Rating: (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
