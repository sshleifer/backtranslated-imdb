I feel completely destroyed. Someone has to repay the $ 4.95 that I spent at Blockbuster to rent this house mess. It's not a musical, it's a total loss of my time and my evening. What I do not get is the reason it was first distributed ??? ... someone MUST make some heavy drugs the night they were made. I've seen better movies coming out of the movie school and I've been to the movie school, so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also just so very bad to view ... shot on DV ??? Nuff said. Songs are not songs, just a banter that sounds the same in each section. Want to see a good musical? DO NOT KNOW THIS MOVIE.
