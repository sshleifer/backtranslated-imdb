Every movie in the thirties is dated, but if you should only watch John Ford's movies, it would seem more dated than looking at others. Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always the heavy selling of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the exaggerated accent of the wickedness of a heavy one. Always the badly made, strange and obvious scriptures. There is no exception. It's just a weak device to give feelings. And the feeling is all that happens for that. What Ford does here does not make me appreciate Lincoln, makes me wonder how the states have ever been resolved by the perfect moron population here. Ford continued to make decent films. This is too dated to be anything but evil. She feels completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And no one in Illinois would say "S" or say "Shonuff!"
