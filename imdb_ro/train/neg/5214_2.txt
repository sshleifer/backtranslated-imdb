METAMORPHOSIS I work through the Chilling Classics 50 collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Launched in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of "Atom Age Vampire," which includes a scientist who strives to achieve similar results. Established in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror film. A university researcher is working to break the human genome to create a serum that prevents aging. Pressed by the administration to publish its work; and, produces some results (or the risk of losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first, thinking that he did not suffer adverse side effects, eventually reveals that the serum has really changed him in an unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The actor is sprinkled; and, the shows have left me a much smaller interest than the film. The score is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their findings is not just about opinion; is absurd; is it ridiculous ?? the best. <br /> <br /> As the others have said, the end turns into a 30-minute gag, which is apparently endless. Without giving it too much, I would say, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Black Lagoon Creature who meets Alone.
