I can not believe that in the 34 previous remarks, no one mentioned that this film is a blatant blow to Born yesterday. A man is committed to bringing a prominent blonde at the height of a gangster's demands. The gun and blonde engaged fall in love and live happily afterwards. The gangster is left standing. But Born yesterday was a smart treatment, while this is just a lot of fluff. Transfer Technicolor to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus will roll into the tomb. Check it on the paper. Recognize it? But it's interesting from a historical point of view to see Rock 'n Roll roots. It is also interesting to introduce Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at that time.
