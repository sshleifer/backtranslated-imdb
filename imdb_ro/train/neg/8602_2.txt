All you need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene, where a guy falls into a lake and eats. Then the title credits are rolling out: see "Slugs!" in large letters, followed by "The Movie". Whew! I was worried that I accidentally directed "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, that's where the film is deteriorating in a killing festivity. You see that a guy cut his hand because he had spears in his garden gloves, two men were attacked by gypsies while they were having sex, and a girl who fell back in an underground passage was killed with the death of murderers . It's a pretty stupid movie that falls into the "so-bad-is-good" category. He is also shot so badly with a film so granular that you are shocked to find out that it was made in 1988 (my estimate was 1974). I am very surprised to have received a score as high as here, because most people here do not give those types of movies no love. But if you want a movie that tries to be frightening but ends up being ridiculous, this is one of your first candidates.
