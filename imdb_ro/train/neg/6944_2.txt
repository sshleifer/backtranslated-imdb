The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was killed and his wife was brutalized - and he was given a chance of revenge when (after the posttraumatic stress therapy) he was put in a room with a man tied to a chair and said that he was the culprit. He receives a large mass of tools to offer revenge: exercises, bats, nails, hammers, torches, whatever you might think that someone might use to physically harm another human being. <br /> <br /> We are going too many scenes of torture before we realize that the Archer Man is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an inconvenient alliance; who put them in this situation and why. Well, when everything is said and done, we do not care ...
