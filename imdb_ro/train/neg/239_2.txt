I will not say that the movie was bad, but it was not good either. I expected something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than that. It was completely old. At each stage of this movie, I hoped to twist and get it? The little girl is burned and wins the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they are employed, they have to get permission for every little move they make. They are so shy, even after so many meetings. I expected my aunt to be more brutal than that. All he did was madness. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have children, but we do not follow them and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, a cruel, good-in-law woman and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the bride's wild father and now it's the other way around. And I knew that Mohlin Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I've lost my time. I'll give him 2/10.
