Is this the worst Star Trek TOS episode? Perhaps, though I vote for being at the bottom 5. I mean, this episode has no scary sense. Do I see anything that makes you annoyed? Save me. This episode also has a different feeling than it, music is intensified, almost forced to increase a sense of suffering to the point where it suffers. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, superior beings like Triskelion or anything other than Medusin, are very boring strangers to make an episode around. McCoy gets to say his famous phrase, "He's dead, Jim." Spock puts protective goggles when he transports the ambassador, but Kirk does not. They go through that terrible "barrier" for the third time that I remember, boring. At least the following episodes of season three would be "Spearguns of the Weapon" and "Pigeon Day" and others who followed, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where people like me would choose. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the purple color, a kind of pink purple, such as when in the corridor outside the compartment, and the aisle that is normally gray is now purple. I have never had a purple bridge but interesting to see, I noticed that in several episodes, it was made by a light filter and works very well, but in this episode the corridor of the ship is quite blade.
