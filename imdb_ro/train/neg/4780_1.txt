I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever watched. I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I just saw when there was nothing on. Now there are five more and I prefer to do my homework than to look at her. The drawing was a bit funny, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now I'm older I'm interested in the show that does not evaluate us. I started to watch Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in cartoons for 5 years. This cartoon did not take too long had only 6 seasons, it was canceled due to the fact that it was lowered by spectators, but some say it was because the writers fled from the ideas, but for most other performances they at least 8 seasons.
