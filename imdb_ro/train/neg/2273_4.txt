This was not the biggest disaster I was expecting, but it's about as positive as the description of the movie. I'm not sure what should be funny about this movie, but I guess it's just a taste. Personally, I do not find it fun to see the idiots who live their idiotic lives or make their fools on television, but again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's miserable talk. I was not bored too much, but I did not enjoy it either. If you are in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that is not too painful to stay, is a good choice.
