As the high school girls' comments on this site look like, it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can a moron stand there and say that just because you make a movie jump a good movie that might be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, I could steal you behind and go "Boo" and make you jump but that does not mean that I'm qualified to write or to lead a movie, not to mention "have everything connected" is not a good reason for a movie to be welcomed. What kind of film would it be if it did not tie everything together, I think that would make half a movie, not a whole movie. In fact, this stupid girl compliments them for finishing the film, and I like how young people today have the media and production companies at such a high level. No wonder the political system of this country can escape with everything it wants, we have idiots like those who come to our country, what would happen if this girl ends up carrying something someday is a thought Frightening. Get a life and watch a real movie sometime, try to redeem Shawshank or the seashore or something and do not comment that it was "boring" after seeing it, just use what little brain God gives you to analyze a little.
