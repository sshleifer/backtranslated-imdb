Okay, I found out about this movie and I looked at the preview read almost all the reviews and had a tough time to discuss whether I should look at it or not. Before I even looked at the movie I was emotionally weird on it. I was so uncertain if I was going to look at it and be disturbed for a long time. So I chose to riscule and see and to be here what seemed to me: the beginning started well for me. Looks like he's heading in a decent direction. We passed the scene of rape and I could not imagine why people were so disturbed or bored with the film. Do not get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and frightening, but I really do not mind at a dramatic point. Then, as the middle came, I understood the boring things that were going on. They were like 5 minutes of photos of anything but people walking around saying or not showing anything! one thing to have a shot in which a person has a kind of emotion, but this movie did not have that. He had about three of these unnecessary scenes where you see that the main character Maya is out of control, but she did not show me well, making me want to move forward. Then, when engaged in hardcore parties, it was not so boring, but still a bit boring. And as a note, Rosario Dawson did a great job yet. Okay, finally, after an hour of futility to the middle, vengeance comes to Maya's attention. Where he bothered. I did not feel bad about him or nothing achieved what she deserved, but the whole scene was very disturbing and I felt everybody after her. I really can not tell you whether or not to watch this movie because so ... do not know cant find a word to summarize. But if you choose to follow, do not be dissatisfied.
