"The Bat People" is a very bad movie that deserves MST3K treatment as well as the other movie "The Terror Creeping". In him we are in a kind of mountainous terrain full of bats. We see that many things happen, such as bats flying out and attacking other things, wagon rides, emergency room troubles, and more! All of this, plus the 1970's cheese mediocrity (hey, think "Mitchell" here!) Making "The Bat People", in fact, one of the best of the latest episodes of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" series! Moviewise, it's terrible. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow look at you. <br /> <br /> "Bats men" - more like "Wicked people !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
