Was it a premonition when Tori complained that her first friend treated her like a robot and then his new boyfriend (the killer) proved to be a designer of artificial intelligence? I think so. Scenes to make you spit with joy: the assemblies are full of joy, a teaser in a kimono (as you say when you put your seductive clothes instead of scooping them off) and a climatic fight on the skis! Enjoy the beginning and the end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act when everything happens. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever make a parade or get out of the snow? Not.
