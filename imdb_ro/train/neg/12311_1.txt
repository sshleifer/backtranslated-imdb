I know we already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... I'm not an old man from the Baby Boom generation who grew up stuck in a blurry b / w image by Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Billy Phil Silver courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I'd enjoyed Steve Martin's travesty if I had not seen or heard about Phil Silvers - I do not know - maybe I would have. Some of the other commentators who think this movie is worthy of a "10" admit they have not seen the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al, you still think Steve Martin's movie is over a "2" mug ....
