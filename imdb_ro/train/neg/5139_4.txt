Many horror fans seem to like their hopes, so I will not be very popular to say that it seemed boring to me. The idea behind her was interesting, but she seems to shoot so much. I think the main problem is that everything is dark. Sometimes horror films in the dark can work (like Humongous), but scarecrows are in the dark for the whole movie. For much of the time, it's hard to figure out what's going on, and although some of the scarecrow's photos were terrifying, the hardest to see. If a little illumination had been used, maybe it would have been better. There are not many movies involving killer scarecrows, except Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend it as over Sightseeing any day.
