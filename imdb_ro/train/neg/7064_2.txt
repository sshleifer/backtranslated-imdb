"John Hughes's son wrote a high school drama I thought about checking IMDb information late last week after I woke up looking at the BBC2 opening credits I just finished watching to her and, unfortunately, there on. Maybe you can not spoil a poor movie, but I'll leave the spoilers in this review ... There's a lot of style on a very small substance: unfortunately, the style did not get well in the eight years since his release, the film tries to show an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life, but under a glossy veneer, a remote or significant argument fails to materialize The characters are painted in psychic accidents, which fall within the generic stereotypes that the writer's father sought to ask questions in the Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping up the rhythm (probably relying too much on information assemblies, which soon becomes a tedious device but at least pushes the story along), but its efforts do not distract enough of the weak scriptures and bizarre castings how one supposes someone to be part of "Maddox," when Blake Shields scares and shines through the side, I can not understand), not to mention the numerous (but I'm for creative license but when "bad guys "I know the identities of" good guys "that make their lives a mess, but they can not act in any way to stop them, you have to wonder why this scenario did not suffer a few re-drafts before production - Daddy read?). I'm sure a younger audience could get a joy from this movie (and all the power for them), but they're really better off sticking out of Hughes Sr. high school, and if the idea of ​​rebellion while school is what reall y, the classic "If ..." of 1968 is a much more satisfactory examination of the subject.
