I just blowed four dollars by renting this movie! Why the Atlantis Alliance would promote such an excuse for a movie is beyond me. But even more surprising were the good reviews some Canadian newspaper critics have given to this film. I'm tired of the media that justifies a movie just because it's Canadian and has a low budget. It's like they expect Canadian movies to be bad, so they offer a good, indifferent review. Now about the film: The act was under the media (except for the male character, which was actually pretty good). The quality of the film was poor, which I think could be expected from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely terrible. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the lead characters, a woman drug dealers who flirt with one of her clients so that they recruit him to repair and steal bicycles for her band, whose sole purpose is accidental destruction of SUVs. It is supposed that many of her group's bicycles are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how she can not afford to buy just new ones because it should be this big drug link from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> Anyway, the point in the story (which does not reveal much more than half the movie) is that the drug dealers intend to build buildings in the Toronto area to try to make houses more accessible - one will want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I have to say more. Shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for its support, and Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers to offer such biased reviews. A film should not receive special treatment just because it is Canadian !!!!
