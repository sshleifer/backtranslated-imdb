Towards the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy's last day image is creatively used to make more of a terrible image. She convinces somebody that if a nasty Bette Davis role would come in her way, she could sharply remove it. Unfortunately, I do not find many other reasons to see this. If you asked what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) Then here's your answer For the rest, Sally Kirkland's crazy woman is very tiring and even if you like much more than me, you will have to admit that tension appears wrong during these scenes. Savage is brutally drunk by the insurance agent is just as uncomfortable, but at least it is a small role. Among the top actors, Nicholas Walker does not inspire any sympathy for Paul Keller's situation, and his action is made of wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises slightly. Sheedy's meticulous and undervalued performance (although it appears to be on the automaton) is admirable in itself, but not contextual to the rest. The sets are unusual, the workspace is not distinguished.
