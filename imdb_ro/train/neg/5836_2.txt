From Richard Condon's Pen (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this story muddled by intrigues and political assassinations. The story, almost narrated by the comic book, is difficult to swallow. The "All-Star" movie, considered, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the play and the crew: the novel was full of the same short. It seems that sometimes the story is actually ridiculing the more sincere effort put into the Manchurian Candidate. A disappointment on all aspects.
