Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS SOUND EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very thin, and once the Air Force friends return to the States with the Cobra Curse, the action is just a game of waiting. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
