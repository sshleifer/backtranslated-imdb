I really liked to like this movie, but she got bored and distrustful. The first blow is a feeding room from a robot who travels to a bomb and is, of course, unclear. Then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even in moments of quiet conversation, to ridicule. Do the rental houses have to get rid of the tripod and Steadicams? The fact that it was shot on 16mm does not help, because the whole film is granular but also steady. <br /> <br /> For all the efforts Bigelow puts on the exact vehicles and equipment, there are plenty of mistakes and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A car would not burst into flame after a single blow and once swallowed it will not be extinguished by a small hand extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would have supported other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. - Exceptionally, it is unlikely to be able to hit an insurgent running long distance, where the bullet clearly takes a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs have been brought to designated storage areas on or near a base, not in a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The petroleum attack is said to have taken place in the Green Zone, an extremely safe area, which has had very few internal attacks. The area is mostly offices and palaces with few homes, but it is presented as a dangerous war of dark alleys and insurgent hiding. Strange, James never comes in trouble for the ridiculous tactics of ordering the two companions to take each one alley alone, putting the kidnapping attempt into the scene. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of this, the 3-man team is always described for cleaning buildings, for driving insurgents, etc., even if there are exactly tens of soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to starve in a dead insurgent, hanging a window to realize it does not fake it? There were no photos to determine the size and layout of the base, or where the Baghdad relationship was. I had no idea who the EOD team was reporting, nor were there any other characters. These are the things the characters would know, so we should do that. Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will be in trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to follow, that choosing the home grains will be overwhelming, and that a driver you have kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the car. Finally, there was an almost total lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troublesome relationship at home, he is reluctant and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly at the end of the movie. What is the purpose? If this is really the best of the war films in Iraq, there is a bunch of sister. Just half an hour I saw it, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.
