What was the thought of Franco Zeffirelli? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty or can I feel comfortable with the idea that someone who did not speak English as the first language completely lost the classical point of Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I can improve on a comment I've read below, so I'll paraphrase it: "Jane Eyre is a great book, the screenwriter should read it once." It is true that the two leaders of this film were unfortunately mischievous. But pity of actors, because the screenwriter has left all the best scenes. The dialogue that makes you understand that Jane and Rochester have a meeting of mind and a sense of fun ... deleted from the script. The marriage proposal, the riddle ... gone. The half-joked, half-heartedly half-hearted feelings of Jane as a fairy spy from England come to save Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. It is regrettable that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane's interactions with the Rivers. But it is unpardonable to have surgically removed love from one of the most beautiful love stories ever written. Do a favor and go to find the mini series (1983) with Timothy Dalton.
