Everybody from time to time, Disney makes one of thes the movies that surprise everyone. One who asks you all the way. In the Caribbean Pirates tradition, this movie will turn into a ghost and will kill and rape the village. It's terrible. If you want a movie "action" meaningless, meaningless, go ahead. I think small children may enjoy this, as they like when the good always wins. But I, I like movies where there is a throw who will win. This film never lets Bad Guys get their upper hand. After all, when heroes are left in an "inescapable" pit, you just know they can get out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he must never think of a riddle or an idea for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. See this movie if you want to see some impressive models, not if you want to see a good adventure or a good movie. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and kids would want more. For example, the scene in which Cage escapes from armed instigators, and the bullets are all deflected by an escape gantry. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything else, just one hand) This film shows the decay of movies and the film industry to cheap gangs and the dull, unrealistic actions that this film offers in immense quantities.
