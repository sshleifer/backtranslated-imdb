It is one of those dramas that is so bad that it almost touches the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely terrible, the direction is terrible, it only illuminates the armature, the only thing that leaves it from a real so bad is a good feeling is that sound design is pretty bad; does not add suspense story, although it tries hard, but does not destroy at least the speeches. There are problems of continuity of the seasons of door exposure. And finally, but not least, the act is terrible. For a professional production has a great sense of a media project at the university, you must be sorry that you are sorry for anyone who has had to put his name in that sense.
