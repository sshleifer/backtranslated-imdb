The author points out a "breakthrough" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he thinks the movie "Bright Leaf" (about which is worth forgetting) is about an ancestor. It is not, and actually does not find anything of interest in this absolutely gloomy and self-indulgent movie, suitable for screening at drunk family meetings, but certainly not for commercial or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not taken by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant, and are of no interest to anyone other than the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at any price!
