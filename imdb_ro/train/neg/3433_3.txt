It's such a strange movie, you can call it terrible, or if you stay with your friends you can give a killing killer-athon. Strange comes back to mind again and again. Shot amateurish, acted even worse and directions, maybe none. The special effects are fun, but the music that accompanies a demon demonstrator child will surely be the biggest blow. See if you have time to kill. But no, do not try to take it seriously. It should be a tribute to the "Porn Holocaust". Since I have not seen it, from the tribute I can think it is so bad. I should have given him 1/10, but he gave me a good or two laugh, so he becomes 3. An excessive gore, the only thing somebody worked. Stay away if you are squeamish, more gore than laugh. I wonder if the producers had a laugh that did it?
