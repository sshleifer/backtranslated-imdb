This movie made for television a stink everywhere. Although it began with great intentions, offering extraordinary sets and props and authentic suits. The film quickly degenerated into horrible dialogue about the nose and rushed to act melodramatically on TV. The characters were so sappy that sometimes I thought they would degenerate into a damn goo, and the action was so confusing and feeble that the soldiers did not seem to stand just around and twist one by one. The Germans were so unrealistically represented that it was painful to look. The only thing the German officers are talking about is how wonderful the Americans are. Take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war, and this movie is silly. However, this DVD has an excellent extra feature that covers letters from the front line of the First World War, which makes this rental not a total waste of my time.
