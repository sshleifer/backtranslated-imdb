Do not waste time with this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. I have to seriously ask myself how the people involved in making this film could have looked at that final stage and thought, "Yes, it's an end now!" and they fought back. For me it seemed rather that they came out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have a cool twist, but still, just let the whole building fall on her face. When the last hit disappeared in black and I heard that credit music started, I was in shock - I could not believe what I was seeing, and someone could even say it was over. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to rewrite the end and give it a substance. Seriously, I would really like to get someone who came up with that in the room, look at them in front and say - WTF ?? !!!!
