I'm not saying the Night of Twists was horrible, but it was not too big. Mediocre to the best. It seems to me, however, that every time a movie type is released, a second must be around the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Vulcan and Dante Peak) Night Twisters is really just Twister, except for the worst and with special bright effects. I have nothing against the actors who played in it, even if they were not great, it was the movie itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole story was too strange to play. A series of tornadoes hit a city, and basically the movie refers to people trying to find their family and friends and deal with damage. I really do not know why duplicates of disaster movies seem to be almost in sync with each other, but this would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
