Finally too stupid and useless. Yes, there is a golden cage metaphor, but most kids would probably miss it. Forgotten. Immediate. Animation is, as I expected, super-real. The plot line could be described as thin, but tenacious. Although the end seemed arbitrary to me. The underworld of sewage is an appropriate disgusting reflection of the above world, and in a way, wealth and money seem to count much and there. Oh, yes, and there is a romantic interest with the woman being the smartest, smoother and better pair - this is quickly becoming a tiring stereotype (anti). Probably your children will still love.
