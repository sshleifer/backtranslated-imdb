I can not believe I actually stood by the whole thing. This movie has the worst action from Killjoy. Here's a short plot of intrigue: The movie starts with Jojo and the other chick who sits on the beach, sinking on a blonde beach "piece" that looks like she was not in the gym for a day in her life. Anyway, everyone knows it, and every chick in the movie wants it. UH OH! Here comes the contest! Stereotype "hot chick" and his best friends, driving a nasty pink car. Soon we find out that Jojo's mother made a living in Australia, which means Jojo should move and leave his best friend behind (oh no, I think I will cry). A huge storm comes and fills its pool with ugly water. In a way, for no apparent reason, the chick falls into the pool and comes face to face, yes, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the "story" really begins. In principle, they want to make the siren fall in love with "hunk". This is a short shot of preteen with such a bad action that it shows in the 80s as the climax of Oscar-winning performances. This movie has all the clich ... the best friends, the "hunk" everyone wants, the bad bad and her good friends, the old scary ... you call it, it's there. I took one for many people watching this. Consider my hour and a 40-minute sacrifice for you. Please do not see this movie. You do not do that I suffered in vain.
