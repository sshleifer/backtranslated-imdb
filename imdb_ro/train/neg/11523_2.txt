"Igor and Lunatica" is a totally useless and amateur attempt on a crazy-hippie-cult-killer horror movie. Apparently, even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic, but incompetent-film makers. This is a typical Troma production, that is, in other words, there are a lot of dull and irrelevant images to accompany the absurd plot. Is there a bit of random gore and free nudity on screen? which is not bad? but everything is so useless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look. "Igor and Lunatica" is so desperate that he even uses a lot of pictures twice, as if he has seen the killing, for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a drug-dependent hippie worship and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's disciples, called Igor, becomes a little too obsessed with biblical stories and drug orgies, and gradually drives the whole cult to descend into a criminal madness. Just to illustrate by a small example exactly how crazy Igor is: he breaks his heart directly from the chest of a really sexy little girl! There is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some pseudo-artistic room tricks, really embarrassing, like slow movies and dreams. Perhaps there is a sequence that more or less qualifies as useful for garbage fanatics and that when a poor girl is half cut with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera shoots the blade's target in the stomach stomach for fifteen seconds.
