Very bad. Very bad. As a colleague who aspires to do, to be in or - at least - to eat a meal at a set of films, it seems hard to criticize the independents who actually took a film of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. Realizing Frightworld does not aspire to anything more than gross exploitation (a honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to several table standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it's more fun than - let's say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, let me ask you to drop some observations. 1) If the gore is the point of the movie, should not you see it? > <br /> 2) If you have rented three sound men, make sure that at least one knows how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie your lead maniac must be more frightening than a smurf doll. Difficult know, but really ... 4) There are a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most can really hire you cheap. Take her who knows how to make a scene. 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean you should do it every two seconds. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At least in this type of editing film should sell gore gags. A chain that appears suddenly in a stomach is not scary, it is negligent. Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once he started to fight back. There were some narrow imagery, unfortunately it was thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better film. I like the moon in Frightworld. Next time, now that they have a kind of movie under the belt, I hope it all involves aspiring to something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
