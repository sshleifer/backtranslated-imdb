At first I was convinced that it was a movie made for television that was not worthy of primetime. But after a few minutes of stunned awe, I realized that there was at least a comic value in the top stunts and c-film that was acting. This movie would have gotten 1 if my wife and I would not have laughed as hard as I saw with wonder that the actors could keep a straight face. It was like a less fun spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse action. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after all the hugs and the five. A few rum and coke will surely help you get off easier.
