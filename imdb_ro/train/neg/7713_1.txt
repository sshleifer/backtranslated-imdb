I knew this movie was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so I went into it with this expectation. I just found out that it was so bad that it was boring for murder. The song of the slim song is fun for about 10 seconds until you realize that there is nothing clever besides its intentional irritating quality. Seeing things get sprinkled with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. There is nothing clever or fun about the movie, except for the premise. It could be a 3-4 minute comic sketch, but this film is not just a feature film.
