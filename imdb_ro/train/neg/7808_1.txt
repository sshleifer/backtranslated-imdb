I'm a huge fan of Michael Madsen, so I do not have to say, I bought this movie without even renting it ... What movie was so horrible I did not take him back to the store, I would not have wanted anyone else to be subjected to this human poison, I just dropped it in the trash can, never the money, worth the price to be able to throw it. The act was not so bad, it was not good or nothing. The story was horrible, and the end was something I despise. He was a broken, alcoholic man. his life was a bunch of junk. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible device to show the innocence of childhood, a dog would have been a lot better. I also hate religion, so this is no doubt ending up with me. Jesus heals all ... I hate knowing that people are like giant and catholic Christians, and time will show that God does not heal everything or anything else. It was a horrible movie if u have the option of seeing it, going or better buy it or rent it and throw it in the garbage and leave the coffee on it in the morning
