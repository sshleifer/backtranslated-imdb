Dave (Devon Sawa) and friends of Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have escaped their way through college. When creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he blackmails them to help him score with Angela (James King), beautiful and good. <br /> <br /> "Great" and "incompetent" comedy - that causes more than to induce laughter. The film tries to attract the target audience with its disgusting bands, but NO WORK. Moreover, it is full of unnecessary and untouchable characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that it's a big turn-off. The film even attempts to use 50-year-old sex / actress / Mamie Van Doren in the most scandalous scene of the movie. IUCK! Later, dragging her down is her absolute predictability and waste (once again) of the actor Joe Flaherty's comedy veteran's talent - when he stops accepting any role that comes and does something worthwhile? Everything, the only thing I liked was King James (aka Jaime), who was very appealing - and he deserved better. of ten of me.
