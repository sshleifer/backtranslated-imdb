There is nothing like watching giant robots fighting in a deserted wilderness, and robot wars are delivering. Sure, the act is bad, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects themselves are actually pretty good for this period. Of course, they are not as polished as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computerized graphics and use thumbnails instead, so they've grown pretty well. Its shortcomings are easily overlooked, given the short duration of the films, and has some humor in language in the parts that make it quite enjoyable. I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or sci-fi cheeses looking for an easy time of distraction.
