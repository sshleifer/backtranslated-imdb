I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and pulled! It was not funny at all. The audience just stayed in the movie and did not laugh at all! Even the children did not laugh! That's sad for a Disney movie! I thought he could find someone better to play the Martian than Christopher Lloyd! He was very stupid! And it was not funny! I thought the speech suit was really stupid! In the original TV series the costume does not speak or move! In my opinion, they should not have to waste their time with this movie! I give her two fingers down! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend anyone's movie! Thank you!!
