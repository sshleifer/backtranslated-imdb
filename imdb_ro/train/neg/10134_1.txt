Steven Seagal's films have never been Oscar material, but with every release that's going on, he's getting worse. This begins with the fact that Seagal was taken over by the FBI for killing a few people in the "defense" of the active army is thus saved from jail to save a stealth stolen plane that will be used by the "bad English villain" of the clich√© on which Hollywood is so obsessed, including these days. Suffice it to say that the movie was terrible the dialogue that is almost always delivered with a big pile of cheese and lack of talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it that do not make any sense and add anything to the story, the characters of the movie as a whole, such as the "lesbian" interaction between the two main females in the distribution that is simply there for titilation to get viewers and yet it's not even daunting just confusing because it makes no sense what happened when it did not need to. In short, a terrible scenario with poor dialogue, played by sub-par, boring actors and sometimes mis-choreographed by action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only serve to achieve almost impossible and make the film even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of life and give this desire, even if you are Seagal's most brilliant fan.
