I hated him. If you think everyone in the South is bad, moral bankruptcy, bad, violent, religious crazy or baby mole, then this movie can be for you. Everyone is weak and apparently ignorant. In a scene, two older men speak in a general store and one mentions that he molested a sister set before binding his shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenager walks on the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers her to help - despite a lump and lack of food or water (without a backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only disgusting and slim, but is proven to be a religious believer (which is typical of Hollywood) reflecting the misleading nature of Christians. A scene in the movie is extremely reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - the biblical verses being shattered by the evil guy. I'm from the Northwest, but I found this offensive because of the wonderful people I know, from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN etc.
