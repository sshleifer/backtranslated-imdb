Okay, I got bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this movie was that it would be an hour of film, then practically the same hour was repeated four times. It consists of 1. Collecting the troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Returning to the wives of the men. 3. Approaching troops marching in a long line. 4. Men running on the hill and shooting, usually the first shot in the head, then three other men saved him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call to base to tell about success 6. Men who turn on their spouses and sing 10 minutes songs. This was the basic film and the same order of events happened 4 or 5 times. and every time he made a retrospection to his husbands, he would show the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have had a retrospective, so it took a long time. Besides, people could not kill their enemy except bayonets or grenades. I liked music and there were many actions, though the action was repetitive. On the whole, I probably would not have seen it again, but it was not too horrible.
