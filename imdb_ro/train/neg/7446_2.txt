I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only prominent presence in this film. But even so, you do not see this movie. Even if he is good as the main villain, you do not want to waste time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and actually did not care if the cross-lovers got together or died. The movie did not care or I thought these people took care of each other. I read a lot of "classic" novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book. The story seems so dull. But I can go on and read it to try and redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also sensible and sensible, and she was much better off in this. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great romance movies like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like Forsyte Saga. Check them out, do not bother with Lorna Doone.
