This is one of the most insidious, insufficient, non-original and useless films ever made! Almost everyone involved in this project has not even tried to make an attractive film. This is nothing more than a continuation of a relentless series of films that try to make use of Smokey and Bandit's success, which I think is the best film of all. Regarding this waste of film, Burt Reynolds is sleeping throughout the film, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors do not have much to do, car racing is obvious, humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more boring and rather than looking at the wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a useless movie, with nothing special or distinctive.
