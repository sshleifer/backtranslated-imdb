Loaded with finite actors, I expected much more from "Deceiver" than it was delivered. The land is extremely controversial and manipulative. Many flashbacks just add to confusion. Credibility flies through the window, and the end becomes unbearable and ridiculous. I would strongly advise those who love filming to rely on something that is at least possible to avoid the "Deceiver," because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm not enough hips enough to get, but my suspicion is that many others were completely confused by the story line and especially the end. Blurring the line between reality and lie simply does not work, because the whole movie does not make sense. - MERK
