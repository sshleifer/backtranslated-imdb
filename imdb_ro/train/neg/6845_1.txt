"I went to the movies to see" Street Beat "/ it was not bad, it was quite" clean "/" Krush Groove "was a movie, that I was not upset / but when it came to" Rappin "I drew the line The word for your mother I want to stop This is just a small sample of the stupa-fly rhymin style on screen in this waste of film and localization permits This movie is seriously wack (thats 80s- I'm just talking about a terrible fickle.) Like an emcee, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of an actor, and as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of a bodybuilder, any film called "Rappin" provide better at the highest standard of this kind of time. So why were they 6 years old in the corridors, even on the day the standards were so high at Webster? Because this rap is poor. So weak that even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold chain. Blondie's rapture is a defiant poetry near this little bit of Dr. Suess in the hood. So do not be a boobie, avoid this movie!
