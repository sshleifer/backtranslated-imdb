I do not know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel movies, but that's exactly what it feels. A low-budget, low-budget movie that has probably been made very quickly contains ridiculous effects, a blueprint and a blurred star to give a name recognition (funny how many 90210 kids make cheap TV movies). Ian Ziering interprets Cortes, whom we have known in history as an explorer who wiped out the entire native population while conquering parts of North America. Here, he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slim opportunist; his character would probably be killed if he had not been based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is in a brief surveillance mission, trying to find something worthwhile to prove he deserves funding to explore America further. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs affected by dinosaurs. The current hero of the story proves to be Lt. Rios, who turns out to be honorable, inventive and wise. He knows what he has to do in any situation, which puts him in opposition with Cortes, as well as with the young, shadowy Aztec shaman. Of course, a native girl, who is supposed to marry the astonishing scary shaman, falls for Rios, continuing his wrath toward the Spanish outback. So it's quite a clich√©. Dinosaurs are easily sent. Despite the fact that it took place in an area that seems to be wide open, the story is spent quite a bit either in the forest or in the Aztec village, at a rate of 95%, so it is not interesting either. I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and, in a sense, disappeared into it. He does not look or sound Spanish for a second, however, making the wrong casting choice in any way. If this movie was released theatrically, he would have been selected for a Razzie, no doubt. Generally, forget it.
