This movie was fine, but certainly defeated the assertion that homosexuals are "born in this way", especially when a woman can come out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman. It seems that Kate's genre preferences stop and leave as a switch, making this movie look a bit simplistic. Also, as is common with movies trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those movie characters who had questions or disapproval of homosexual lifestyle were labeled "bigottes." And there was no happy environment. Whether Kate's friends and relatives have completely embraced them, or have turned away from her. This is not typical for interactions between homosexual and non-homosexual relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, without necessarily condemning the choices they make. Unfortunately, the movie did not show any of these types of interactions. For a movie that tries to show tolerance and acceptance, it seemed like a very intolerant movie! Then at the end, Kate apparently decides that after all these years, she wants to be with the Mac and it's all a great thing - is that what gay is really all about? Come on!
