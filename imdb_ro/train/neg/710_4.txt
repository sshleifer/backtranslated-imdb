I read Rice's novel with interest, and I became quite pleased with his characters and the story of the heart based on historical truths. However, I was simply APPROVED at this disastrous adaptation. Casting was based only on the physical aspect and not on the acting talent (except Peter Gallagher's obvious exception, who did not have blond hair or could not follow his way out of a wet paper bag). The embarrassing and inconsistent attempts of the film to affect a French accent were hilarious, but not in a fun way. I found myself guilty through this melodramatic and melodramatic strip and I was surprised to have done it all the way. A warning for the fans of the novel - stay away from it.
