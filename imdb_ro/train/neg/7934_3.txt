A family traveling to their daughter's softball line decides to take the "scenic route" and get into the middle of nowhere. The father is a passionate photographer, and when he hears an old abandoned party in the city, he decides to take another detour to take pictures. Of course, the side show is filled with inbred strangers, who quickly kidnap women and let the young son and father do it by themselves. The only great thing about this movie is how the family really is fighting against their male captors. Besides, it does not deserve anything about the movie.
