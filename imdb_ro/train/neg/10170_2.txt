The championship game is just a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not the way it should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a free-will killer, life gets in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful moment. Can things be returned in order and a killer stop before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing else but a device of plotting and a subsequent thought. Instead, Superdome is one of those films made for Hollywood-centered TV films that have been made for 70-year-old soaps and are never. Nothing of casting is making its way through this thing, without anyone looking good. The best (or the worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role that generally looks lost for what it is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a "man"? Yeah sure! It's just as credible as the deal he has with David Jansen's soaked liqueur. Also, the movie has no rhythm. Trying to get all four or five story lines in the movie scores any stream that Superdome could have. Without drama or suspense, Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a film made for the 1970s television. The only highlight for me was the vocal work of Charlie Jones, a sportsman who wanted to listen to me. The eloquent that he overcomes intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is a pure cheese at its best. Like most of those who have seen Superdome, we did the courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. This may be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of early show performance. So even if I only rated Superdome 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
