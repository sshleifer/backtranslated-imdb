Störtebeker is really one of the worst mini-TV series ever made on this planet. The act is unbearable, and the background is largely nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was presented as a three-house village. Instead, it was an important city at this time, the best days have already passed. Secondly, Hamburg would never have been the town to take care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the main city at that time was Lübeck. But worse than all this: direct! How can a dilettante allow this guy to direct such a movie? Impossible! There was no credible scene, the battles were ridiculous and we could not suppress the laughter at the worst scenes. I do not understand at all how an incompetent major TV station might be.
