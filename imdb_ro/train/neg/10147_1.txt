Usually, I do not comment on anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but that, which I had to comment on ... I was convinced to watch this world movie like action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff , but only a few minutes in the first place and I changed my mind ... The actor of praise, stupid script and a great scientific fiction. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not worry ... And one more thing before any movie usually checks the comments users and rank on this site ... 3.7 points and give this movie a try, now I wonder WHO question this movie, giving it more than 2 points ??????????
