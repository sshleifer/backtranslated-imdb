I was also intrigued by the high rating (8.5) for this movie and was very disappointed. I just saw some good foreign movies and I was expecting him to do three consecutive, but it was not. I went with a Spanish friend who felt the same thing. There is not too much a plot, if any. It does not necessarily have to be in a movie, but I have to have fun or get me. The best thing I could say is that she aspires to be an Altman-esque film, though with a very small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments are pushing easily with 97 minutes slow for nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this movie. I give it a number of 3. <br /> <br />
