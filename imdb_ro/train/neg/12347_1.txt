This is easily the worst movie Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this film is a black sign in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both in an overcrowded film about a girl going to the army. Very bad. And there is never a scene to convince in any way. It's not really difficult to make such a movie. Everything the crew does could be an idea for anyone. The writers did not have much inspiration; many insane dialogues that did not make sense; and some brainless actions. We strongly recommend that you stay away from this garbage. I hope that many talented people involved in this project realize that this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and smarter movies than this unnecessary misery.
