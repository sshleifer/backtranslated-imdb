A low budgeted effort from Texas that is at least filming well, but that's a little consolation. Evil acts, or, I should say, evil over action, a fairly clear story line that is nothing new, special bad effects, evil, evil, evil. It seems that a bunch of young people put together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different. It has a prolonged lesbian theme, which is not only annoying, but of course fills empty places, many of which are many. Putrid, beaten, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
