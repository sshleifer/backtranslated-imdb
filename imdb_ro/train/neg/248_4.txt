When will the evil stop? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol. They continue to make films with the same story, falling over each other, trying to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately they fail to do this because it is not a good story. Moralist, old-fashioned, happy conservative. As if people would learn. The many different versions of this movie prove that we are not.
