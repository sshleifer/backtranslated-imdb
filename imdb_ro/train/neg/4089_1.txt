Warning: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressive evil. Note I said, "almost." This is nothing more than a lot of random scenes tied together in a weak attempt at a story. The protagonists (NEED to call them "heroes") bring innocent viewers for their food and also rob them for similar reasons. There are also tons of homoerotism, which was a tour for me. (SPOILER: It seems that sadness (which is only topless and not empty, as other opinions claim) is killed early but is miraculously recovered, adding another 70 minutes of torture to the audience.) I can not shake the feeling that the animal abuse has taken place over and over again in this cinematic abomination. If you are in a MST3K mood, you can find this pursued, but for the most part you can forget it. Begin to rent the original DVD Conan instead.
