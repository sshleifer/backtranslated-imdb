I've read all the "Love Come Softly" books. Knowing well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed with this movie. The only thing they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit her (although they come in the book of both parents). That's all. The story line was so twisted that it was very sad and, sadly, out of the book that I could not enjoy it. Even though I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know Pioneer's life was tough but the whole movie was a downer. The rating is to have the same family orientation of the movie, which makes them great.
