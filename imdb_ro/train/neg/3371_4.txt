Wonderfully unlikely and crazy potboiler that at least has some redemption photos, clear location, but it's too incredible to generate much in the way of tension. We hoped Stanwyck would not resume it in time, because she was indeed buried in wetness in several ways than her husband, and had an idiot child ... why did not you run away with Meeker? But the nasty question remains .. what kind of wood was the fact that the ditch made if a rotten piece pulled off did not float? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does everything he can with the material, but it's stupid.
