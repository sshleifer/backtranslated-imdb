* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brighter critic of the media obsession with violence. But this statement ignores the real content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown serial killers as vicious and inhumane murderers of innocent people and contrasted him with a morbid fascination in the media. Instead, it gives them justification. The film describes exactly about each victim as someone who deserves to be hurt. Employing vicious stereotypes, Stone portrays the victims as unpleasant caricatures - stupid tomatoes, English-speaking immigrants, lazy, fat people. The only person that homosexual birds is also a stereotype. Of course, they are friends with the old, American-Indian who uses hallucinogen, because they're fashionable, buddy? Let's make him an admirable character. The fat, the Chinese clerks and the "hicks" are unparalleled, so to make it seem worthwhile to die. Instead of twisting, hurting who are corrupted by their mistakes, their kidnapping makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surrealistic visuals are bound to attract more sensitive people. Justice is mocked. Police officers and prisons are portrayed as brutal, ugly, and murdered in comparison with GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports of the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There is no hue or subtlety in the movie - just superimposed and visual performances. The film does not say anything new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in the real reactions of the real world to it. Some impressed young people who have seen this film have cited it as a source of inspiration for the crimes they have committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with terrible results in real life. The smart message can not be seen.
