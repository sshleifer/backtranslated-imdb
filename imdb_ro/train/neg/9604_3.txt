The first thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It does not waste nudity or anything else, but many were not necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman, believing that her family has told her her ancestor who resembles her was a werewolf and thinks her destiny is destined to be the same. In fact, I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was meant to be a complete psychological film, but Universal threw into the real Wolf man that you should never have seen for an extra or two buffoon. I think this concept of a person who is not really interesting to the werewolf. Unfortunately, it's not the movie I was looking for. Instead, we know she is not a werewolf from the beginning, so there is no excitement or twist, too, they are trying to make the movie look like something that really happened scenario. They fail to add one or two parts of the film, referring to it as reality. At first I was delighted to read the film's description. But I realized that it was a cover just so that they could expose the breasts of the main characters as often as possible. Annik Borel is either a decent actor who plays a big psychotic role or a very bad actor psychotic role. Since the Danniele character has no brain and is just a nut running around crazy and noisy and cock like a wolf, there is no need for a little skill to play. She has moments when her performances intertwine for a frightening moment, but are quickly ruined by the poor work of the camera and light. The idea is great, but it's done secretly throughout the movie. 3/10
