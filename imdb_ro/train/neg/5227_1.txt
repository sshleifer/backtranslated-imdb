........ and one extremely bad at this !!! How long did the last ship last? 14 episodes or something? I can see why now. I bought the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. This is the only good thing about the experience (the incident) <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on acting because they were, I think, quite new people who have not managed to get the job down yet. At least I have not seen them before in any major show, theater or television show. If I did, then I forgot them easily. But the special effects were absolutely terrible. True, this is not really a million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did better than it was thirty-five years ago. Especially I laughed at bad boats (reapers or something like that) when watching Firefly, who looked hilariously, with the smoke coming out of the engines, showing something like a giant model missile. I fully expected to finally see Wiley Coyote riding upstairs, while following after Roadrunner. Modern jet / rocket engines do not even do that bad. And that was not even the worst. Western wild-type excavators were wondering if I actually looked at a SF movie or Gen Autry genre. Regardless of hype, do not waste your time ... it did ... all the 80 minutes of the "Firefly" disaster.
