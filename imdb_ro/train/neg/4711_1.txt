I really hate this show! I saw an episode and I knew this show was terrible. The story lines are so badly written and executed, and the jokes are very bad ... That's just a spitting of Dexter's and Johnny Quest's Laboratory, about an unpleasant boy with haunted blond hair, with twin sisters and dog talking ; a father sitting at home and a smart, super-busy mother ... Like God-flippin-God! Their father is a mother-f ** kin 'crazy home-maker, not so gay! If my dad is a house maker, I would personally die! The shame that is ... I really would be. I have nothing else about this ... this transvestite, but only a word; count them 3 words to describe them: <br /> <br /> · Blades, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all we could tell people, it's definitely making my list of the most serious animated series EV-ER! If I had such a thing.
