The distribution, though nothing special, all do a good job, the story seems to be a good idea, the script is susceptible to being subjected and the end has a pretty good twist; so what's wrong with her? For starters, the special effects are very bad (if this was done in the 1960s) it might be OK, but in 2003 there is no excuse for visuals as poor as this one. It makes me laugh that the DVD claims with great pride "by Jeepers Creepers special creator". Secondly, the direction is weak, this film just does not capture the essence of the story, A doctor feeding the souls held by the hospital to the Devil (or the demon-like creature) should be tense or frightening; it simply is not. In all this is a rather poor film, and though bearable and sometimes easy to enjoy, it is still probably best left alone. <br /> <br /> Pretty sad 4/10
