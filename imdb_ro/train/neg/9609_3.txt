I started to watch this movie waiting for a horror film that can not be tolerated by Hammer ... and I was not far away. There is a fairly large amount of gore and have cast a lot of nudity, but the second half of the film has some ironic twists. The holy cow, they actually put a little thought in the story and did not fall completely into the predictable things they expected at the beginning. And dare to say this, some of the "free" nudity was not so free, because it fits with the story and setting. Do not get me wrong, bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a much smarter shade than terrible hair, like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
