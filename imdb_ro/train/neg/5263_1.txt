This is with my hands down the worst movie I can ever remember watching. Everything was incredibly clich√© and delayed. The actor was also horrible. The work on the camera was not bad, but they still could not redeem it. The writer / director of this film must suffer from the bottom syndrome if he thinks this movie will help her in her career. I want to return for an hour and a half of my life that I've been looking at these crap. I'd rather see a video of growing herbs. I can not believe IMDb makes me write 10 lines to post, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I have to continue to alert others about it. The reason I made this film is that my friend asked her from the local library, considering that Kris Kristoferson was called "Disappearances." I do not know why it was because this garbage is over in my DVD player but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / scriptwriter of this film is more likely to ever admit it on the street.
