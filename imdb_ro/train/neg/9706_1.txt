... and actually gave me a ZERO on 1-10 scale. I participated in the 1952 films and I saw more than 1000 in the theater (they do not shoot that I see only on TV). This is the only movie I've ever rated ZERO. My wife and I took the four children (aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the children thought it terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (26 years ago) who alerted me to this site (amazed that the movie gets a total rating of 4 +). The dinosaur animation looked amateur at the time (and is even worse in retrospect), the act (especially by Sean Young) is atrocious and the story line is simply stupid. <br /> <br />
