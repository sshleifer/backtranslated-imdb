In the unlikely event that some aspiring directors read these comments, I would like to offer advice (free of charge!) From the perspective of viewers. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure movies, let go of it. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, an amazing "comic relief" character killed and beheaded and following her with a monkey shaking a tree and throwing a coconut on the cannibal head makes you think you did not know what kind of movie you would like to do. It's boring, meandering, cheap, racist ... get the picture. Some clever moments and some nudity ghosts from Kathy Shower (too outlined here) do not deserve you at all. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten about the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
