If you look at Corey Large information here on IMDb, apparently there is a movie titled "Reload" in production (in June '08) starring a character called Sebastian Cole. First, how to make such a horrible movie ever win a sequel ... and secondly, was not Sebastian killed at the end of "Loaded"? I looked at this in the morning when I was struggling with insomnia, so I went in and out while she was there. I'm sure we lost some plot points, but overall it looked very weak. The performance of the great was (for me) one of the most powerful parts of the film. I'm also a little surprised by all the people who comment on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was beautiful, but not exceptional.
