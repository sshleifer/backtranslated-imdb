Just like a sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is a fake. Like someone born in Sheffield and still tied to the city, I was extremely disappointed with this film. Someone said he could have been put in Oklahoma, and that sums me up. This looked like a romantic view of North England, made for the American market. Probably many Americans - and many people in southern England - do not realize that Sheffield is a large city of about half a million people with a sophisticated urban culture. Among the giants, it was described as a small, semi-rural, dead city, where everyone in Sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub and where the idea of ​​party party was the dance of a line in a hall villages are alike. This was a small community nearby, not a metropolitan city. Sheffield-class men were totally different from their real-life counterparts, who are generally silent and communicate with each other in beatings and brief dry observations. They do not speak, and certainly do not sing in choruses. Even the rural settlements, presumed in the top district, seemed strange to me. I recognized a few places where I strolled on foot, but some of the aerial posts of the poles that span a grim landscape remind me more of Wales. Indeed, in the credits at the end I noticed a reference to Gwynedd, Wales. The peak district is in the summer, dragging passengers and tourists in cars. It is located between two major cities. It's not a wild thing. As for the idea that a young woman may fall in love and a craving after, Pete Postlethwaite, she was ridiculous and could only be a male dream. Her reasons to become her lover have never been obvious. None of the men were presented as having a partner or families; they were in a vacuum. Anyone who wanted to see a film about unemployed Sheffielders would have been lost. This Sheffield existed only in the minds of middle class writers and filmmakers. It was a giant fake! <br /> <br />
