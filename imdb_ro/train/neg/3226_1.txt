We have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. Practically, dinosaurs come aboard this ship, piloted by a strange wizard called Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the desires of children everywhere and decides that he should give children the desire that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everyone for shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these things that make them smarter (Too bad that scriptwriters did not have it). By the way, it seems weird that ALL of the children's wishes in the world, Neweyes grant the desire to bring dinosaurs into modern times? Why do not you give your children the desire to stop hunger? Disease? War? Really, come back! Does not Neweyes have anything better to do with all the power it has? Finally, when dinosaurs end up in modern times, they start singing, dancing, and destroying chaos (basically one thing you could see on a bad LSD journey, I mean where else do you see a game of golf T-Rex and jumping on a Spider-man balloon?). They get into the circus, and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes the children who are friends with the dinosaurs to sign a blank contract. Why? Why would children sign an empty contract? Screweyes says if the dinosaurs take something ... "Brain-Drain" That he will let the kids go. Dinosaurs, instead of destroying the evil roots of their roots in their limbs, must agree and agree with its terms. What the?! This is stupid! They could have threatened him, made him give up the contract, ate, then left with the kids. I think the directors are trying to prove that the violence is bad, which is a point when the dinosaurs finally escape and a bunch of horses surround Screweyes and apparently eats it completely. Yes, this is not violent at all! We've come back has no meaning, it's not fun, it's stupid, it's bad, it's not enough written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to filming. Even for a kid's movie ... that's BAD.
