Well, I'm starting to recognize that I'm not a John Ford fan. (I watched "The Informer" just because I'm trying to make a list of "the best"). So if you are, just pass, because you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What is a prey and an uplifting of things! I will say it's a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films are about the Irish revolution), but as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under extremely active and cheap feelings. I suppose it is somewhat interesting to look for a while to see the transition less than uninterrupted, which was made from silence to "talks" - the styles of acting of some of the directors have that endemic quality at the beginning of movies and films they feel like they could play better with the title books than the dialogue they talked about. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from resuming six times each emotion). What dialogue is there, usually, "I'm always behind Charms Lucky!" which is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are useful to remind us that we are in Ireland, because the sets are the same as if they were drawn from a German expressionist piece shot in the next sound stage. (Apparently, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers breaking Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) Techniques are changing. Taste changes. So I will not go as crazy as it seems that this movie was so much appreciated in its day. But he is not one of the classics to keep in mind - more just a "correct warning" of the far too simplified malarkey type that Ford will dedicate to his career.
