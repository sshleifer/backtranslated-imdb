There are repetitions of phrases - "my little sweet daughter" and minor variations of that line that comes to my mind ... and it's just a dialog of soap. "In addition, the blues' main theme is horribly weird and totally wrong for it, and feels unusual, especially because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes, even when the emotional context of the scene Then, whenever it appears, the transition from one scene to another is extinguished as a major move. Music is harassed and it is as if the writer had written music for a soap or a sitcom - a Canadian sitcom with a a low budget of 80 - and that makes it feel as if we were always on the point of throwing to an ad. This is so miscast, there is a lot of overacting and it is a real stretch that so many of these characters only use a type of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent.

When any foundation is agitated and unstable, it is impossible to build on it without its flaws revealing itself in exponentially more damaging and unwavering ways.
