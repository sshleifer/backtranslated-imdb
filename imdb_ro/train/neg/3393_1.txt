If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend has a romantic mood, let her be a boy. But get ready by bringing your hp if it's a radio. After watching a movie as good as Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what's happening again in Indonesia. It seems the only idea is to make money, but nobody seems to be serious about Indonesia's image in the world of entertainment. That it is a "global" world, does not seem to come to the minds of filmmakers in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian audience swallows everything that is presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with a flavor of the West, they move away from it. OK, the story is good to start. And it could have turned into a beautiful movie. But did the director never think that a musical needs first of all live music or at least a good performance and secondly a good choreography? In this movie, rendering is so stupid that it makes you want to cry right there in cinema. Every word you hear is followed by LATER seconds by the actor or by who plays the play and is extremely annoying while watching the movie. Choreography is like planning to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but eventually thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They only forgot to change choreography. Do not dance hard to see, they jump here and there, throw their feet in the air, and that's about it. Well, at least there is a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is more romantic, DO!
