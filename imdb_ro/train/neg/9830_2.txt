I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are very Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. I was angry with the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that moral teaching, without learning that it is Jesus, which is the basis of morality, is in itself wrong. A scene shows the lead character tells a boy he is wrong to steal, and then the character continues to say that Jesus taught us this. We found this offensive: must we believe that "do not steal" came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And theft was acceptable before that? I rented the movie from Netflix. I should have figured out the nature of the movie in the comments. Good.
