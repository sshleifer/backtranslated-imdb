In 1967, my workers find the remains of an ancient civilized civilization called Abkani, who thinks there are bright worlds and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something bad went past the closed door. Twenty-two years ago, the Office of the Paranormal Research Agency of the Government 713 was led by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who experimented with orphaned children. Currently, one of these children is paranormal researcher Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just obtained an artifact from Abkani in South America and is being pursued by a man with skills. When an old foster house boyfriend disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that the demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the head of the 713 Bureau, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team, fight evil creatures. Despite the fact that he had a good charismatic cast, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in Dark" never works and is a complete mess, without character or plot development. The reason can be explained by director Uwe Boll's "brilliant" interview in DVD Extracts, where he says "video games are the best-selling younger generation that is no longer run by books." Moreover, target audiences would be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. I'm sorry, but I have two unsatisfied statements with younger generations. I have a daughter and a son and I know many of their friends and I'm not the kind of bad stereotype the director says. Moreover, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark? Despertar do Mal" ("Alone in the Darkness? Awakening of Evil")
