This movie is not very good. It's boring and not too much blood for a horror movie. The plot is not happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. He had a lot of chances to kill the vampire hunters because he shows that he has light as the reflexes. But whenever he has one of them fixed, he only takes time and something always happens where he does not bite them. No wonder this went directly to the cable. VERDICT FINAL: It's almost not as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time with this.
