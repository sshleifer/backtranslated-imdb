This movie tried to be too many things at once: political satire, the Hollywood blockbuster, the romantic comedy ditched, the promotion of family values ​​... the list goes on and on. It did not fail at all, but there was enough interest to prevent me from stopping it to the end. While I appreciate the spirit behind the war, INC prevents me from seeing such a thing, and especially when it is taken up by its objectives to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than simply the writing, direction and poor production of this special movie. a critique that needs to be done about the corporatisation of the war. But fun in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. It reminds me of a little of three kings, which trivializes similarly a cause for concern.
