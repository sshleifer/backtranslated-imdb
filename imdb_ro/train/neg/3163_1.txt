Well, this is the first post I've ever commented on about IMDb. You understand this, this movie made me come and warn all the good souls that will stop experimenting with movies. Because most of them gave me the comments I thought to watch this movie because it seemed to have decent actors (though they read the most serious critics against this movie) I thought to experiment it assuming it is a comedy movie. . comedy ... then it all began to be pathetic ... man can think of himself, you feel like going and beating your head every time the pathetic woman, called the heroine of the film, gets helpless. ..Huh ~ ~ Well, how much can a person digest a sick all the POSSESSIVE witches who are trying to do everything in their power to irritate you and stop what you are doing. The next bad thing about the movie is the hero "ZOMBIE", yes, while losing a fiance he beats like a goat, with black marks u with his eyes, and with the "terribly bad" hero sister .. you wud bleeding from head to toe, if you tried and completely succeeded watching this movie ~!
