Before watching this movie, I was expecting a fictional drama based on ideas from the book; Instead, it is the book, interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating the various "diseases". This did not disturb me much, but it prevented me from enjoying the movie. A story or even two or three stories with extracts from the film interleaved would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to rely on a psychology text, you have to find a more interesting (and preferably more precise) text than it. The film draws in places where it is a bit more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be completely intolerable if it were not sexual in nature (because most of us, even me) are sexually interested . Fortunately, there are several stories with a development of the real character that attracts us. But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality have remained uncontested for the most part. We hoped he would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic conception of psychology are still inherited by many today. So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few little girls and orientations, with some interesting little stories, presenting the trials and tribulations of some "sexual deviations" before being healed. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the speed of access (and mood) of awakening. And, as a low-budget movie, cinema and acting are not exactly superior. Although I was pleased with the music, the costume and the interior design, I felt that the subject of this film was right on my alley and I still feel it is a media below. It's worth a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt extremely generous. I can not imagine anyone who enjoys it unless they have already had an interest in sexual fetishism.
