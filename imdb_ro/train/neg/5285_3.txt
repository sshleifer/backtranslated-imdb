Somewhere on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, you just have to read them. I agree with this. However, we like the adaptations of a great literature and the strike of the current writers reminds us that without good writers it is hard for the actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens when you do not have a good base in a well-written adaptation. This version does not compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, who acted well and preserved the essence of the era and character constraints (except the bizarre parade and kissing on the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a Twetty Anne, which seems to be engaging. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen subconsciousness. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely thrown away, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's college student who slept in bed and poor, walked to Baia-sneaking, as many of the characters looked like. Captain Wentworth's character and intelligence, which made Anna love him first, did not appear to be written in Rupert Penry-Jones's Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey much more with a look than P-J was able to do with his positions. In general, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to cut the novel into a hand-held melodrama of questionable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they did to Shakespeare's adaptation: to adapt it to the present. At least "The Bride and Prejudice" was removed from historical and locational settings and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". It was NOT PERSUITY, but they did not know what else to call.
