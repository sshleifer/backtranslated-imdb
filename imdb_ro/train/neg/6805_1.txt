I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. I still can not believe what I watched. This is absolutely the worst EVER movie. If I list all the flaws in the movie, this review will take me a lot of sentences (very funny bugs because of the fact that I am bad though) <br /> <br /> You have to be amazed at the skill given to saving the plane. they did not even know how to move. Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and something I do not understand is the way the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero. Of course, the major defects will be the landing of a 747 , who need only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in the transmission to land the plane ... amazing .. as well as the dead troops that had almost no blood. But I strongly recommend watching this movie because it is very interesting to see how bad it can get something
