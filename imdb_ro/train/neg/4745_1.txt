I can not say that saying that this movie was terrible. The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of your ancestors was a lust. But telling the public that every Chinese knows Chinese history without studying it, even ridiculous. It's like saying that every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino etc. It's simply not credible. The story is still. He talked about Shin being a monastery in China - identifying him later from Bejing. However, the early film sequences show the map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own, granted. But it is a distinct nation and even labels "Mongolia" on the map. Disney Studios has failed in 5th geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet somehow feels connected to him. Her preparation is raw. And let them cut their tracks: everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. Taekwondo's action has been played everywhere and unrealistic in many situations. The bad thing for the eyes was scary. However, the end to the left would have been the only descendant about it. She should have left her bad eyes ending in her. Instead, in some ways evil is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> In general, it is not worth the dog's time in the movie. Brenda Song should continue with another studio. "F"
