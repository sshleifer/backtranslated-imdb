Leaving the class to follow this in English was a bad idea. Greasy and more educative films can have an effect, but it seems that this has had no effect on the class - whenever the teacher left, the discussions quickly began - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" being not used at all. And when you look at that, it's easy to see why. The act is nothing special - everyone seems bored with bit, just reading from the page without care in the world. Shakespeare always preferred the exhibition's dialogue with action and death, but I could not understand any word that no one says. The costumes are not too bad, nor are the special effects - the class may not have loved the movie, but they did not even take the pisces. But it's hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any inspiration or joy. The scenes from the beginning of the movie were not too bad - although the rain seemed a bit unrealistic, everything was done well and well. But where were the cut heads and the explosive columns? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken much more seriously if he wore clothes - but, as it was all, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is in no way appealing to both sexes. Women and girls will have no love or comedy to enjoy, and there are a lot of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys. The tempest was not bad, but it felt like something the producers should do, not something they wanted to do. And general boredom and inspiration look. 3/10
