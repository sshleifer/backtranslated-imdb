As a graduate of Hammer, I'm afraid I have to get the courage to watch this movie and the one who follows it, Holiday on the Buses. I saw the movie One in the buses and I considered one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of the terrible comedy that had plagued British TV screens around the '70s. I'm ashamed to say that in reality they were parts of this movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I was familiar with the characters now and I enjoy some situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey very funny, although I could swear that never in the trilogy tells him the phrase, "I will bring you Butler." After seeing Bus Holiday, the jokes began to be slim and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in that the second film made is the best (though this is probably the only way they can be compared). only those who would like to watch this movie are probably fans of the television series that will undoubtedly enjoy this, and Hammer complements me like that. For completists, I would say that this movie is not that bad and I can certainly think of the worse comedy of Hammer.
