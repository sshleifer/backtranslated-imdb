This movie is actually worse than most of the movies I have suffered so far and I have suffered a lot. Absolutely nonsense. Has a terrible, forced dialogue; unnecessary developments; have really shot scenes of "frightening images," which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 to the best attractive women; the long, boring sexual scenes involving the women mentioned (forget what you know about virgins, especially those with false breasts); mumbled, hard to understand by some characters; and actually used Killer Klowns masks in the cosmic space during a masturbation scene, which should be a salvific grace because the movie was quite funny, but it is not. Veden Fell is the worst man in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give it a miss.
