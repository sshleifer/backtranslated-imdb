Being a fan of horror movies, I saw this in my video store and I thought I was going to try. Now that I have seen it, I wish I did not have a living soul on the planet. We rent the movie for free and I feel like I did not give my money any value. I've seen some terrible horror movies in my time, because I'm a fan of them, but that was just an insult.
