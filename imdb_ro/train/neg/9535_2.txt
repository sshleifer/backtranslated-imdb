believe it or not, this movie is worse than the third number. it is slower, the act is worse, and the story is very weak.there is not a lot of good to say about this film.the battle scenes are more boring than the number three and I would have thought it was impossible. this is very slow for 90 minutes. kept, in fact, I blocked him, hoping it would be better. if you really want to see this movie, you should try to find the cheap rental of it.it is hard to find (for purchase, that is) and probably for why.like number three, this movie has nothing dealing with the first two.it is the same in the name only.anyway, the most can give the best of the best: no warning is 2/10
