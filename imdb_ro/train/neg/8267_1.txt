I'm starting to see a pattern in the movies I give 1 at. There are almost all the films my wife has made me watch. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in movies. However, this is a typical story about pre-teen girls, but it is even worse than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rules of any film. He / she has made the character not to be moved. She starts by being a full friend to her first girlfriend and then finds out when she is 30 years old, that she is basically a person (who has jobs, etc.). Why would we feel F for this person? Okay, let's say we can get over that. Jennifer Garner is just as attractive as you can without having a kind of deformity. I do not know if she is the writer's fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for upset. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT entertained, they are annoying. Far and far the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to "Thriller". It was a bad crack that was painful. She showed her by practicing dance from the beginning. That explains why he knows it, but a whole crowd of people? Brrr !!! Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These body / child changes becoming adults overnight become really out of hand, and this is by far the worst.
