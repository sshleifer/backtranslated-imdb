Thank God I followed this to a friend and I did not pay for it. The movie is horribly transparent, and the whole movie feels like an episode of a TV show. If you have knowledge about computers or electronics, be careful. You will feel that the film is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh displays the poorest action I've ever seen, excluding pornography. Lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the one who wears the film. <br /> <br /> I hate losing almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It is a shame that they have come to call it a sequel because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
