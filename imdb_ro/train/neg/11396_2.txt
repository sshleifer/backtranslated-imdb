The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, eventually makes a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows much of everything that came before Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but manages to do it with humor enough to be supervised ... only afterwards. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is thin and the actors can not let go of a grocery bag. Put them all together and you have a mulch pulp ball for a movie. Sometimes when I get bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar to this. Stir it for 90 minutes and you will have a strange taste in the mouth and no nutritional value.
