Based on Michael Chabon's novel, The Pittsburgh Mysteries refer to the young son of a notorious gangster who spends the last summer teenage roaming with two friends. The year is 1983, and the young artist Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Totally opposed to his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a broker. Visible with painful attempts to create a beautiful hip-hop cinema, the whole movie feels like the director - whose previous Dodgeball effort was funny, if it's absolutely commercial - indie indie desperately seeks credibility by sliding the aspects of other indie films, but sprinkling with stars such as Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. As in many premieres premiered at Sundance this year, it was a studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credibility - it also failed as a stand-alone movie.
