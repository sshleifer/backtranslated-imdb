The second prophecy, what about that? They completely renounced the originality of the first film and simply made a movie with Chris Walken's sparkle. It's not even written by the original writer! If you saw No. 1 do not forget no. 2 is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nr. 1 do not forget no. 2! Go see No. 1 to experience something original and fun
