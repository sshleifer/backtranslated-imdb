What made the French link work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this Frankenheimer-directed catastrophe (which has brought such stones as Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau Island), the film focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession to surprise Charnier (Rey). The fictional idea that NYPD will allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of French local authorities is laughing funny. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier did not skip the city with 65 pounds! A street value of 32 million, but yes, we're going to send Doyle to find this guy, but it was his crash. Please!!! The story was feeble. The actor was terrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who has completely overcome his role). Direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do a favor and follow the first installment twice and jump over it.
