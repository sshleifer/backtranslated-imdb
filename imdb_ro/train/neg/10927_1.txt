The reviews for this movie were the hottest in the best time, while expectations were raised in the sky: a large budget, tons of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and a main loving actress for everyone. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's humorous trip to the fantastic world fails in all ways to entertain the audience (I have not heard any laughter throughout the presentation), passing through the thin story line of the page and one-dimensional characters without a single sparkle, not a sign of the magic she wanted to have. The 90 minutes of the film are sterile, clumsy, and some good actors do their best to come as professionals in a feature that certainly can not seem like a great idea on stage, not to mention the paper. "L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay" is a collage of comic sketches, linked together with a layer (very) thin of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
