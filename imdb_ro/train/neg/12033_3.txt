Film about a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. A new family moves, with overwhelmed dialogue, a mediocre action, a green jello salad with cut carrots, and every other "Mormon joke" known to man. Anyone outside of Mormon culture will have difficulty stomaching this movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chicot here and there. You'd better watch other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than try to stay here. The actor is mediocre. Jared Hess has found much better movies such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite." I would recommend both movies over this groaner.
