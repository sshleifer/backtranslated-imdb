If this could be rated at 0, it would be. From the atrocious wood that acts at the boring, ferocious rhythm, the puericular exploitation angle, and the pseudobulbular torture of the sophomore added simply for the sake of sad audiences, this is a disaster of a movie. predictable, from the very beginning is absolutely sure of what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a boring, unusual start to a pathetic and gloomy end, every presence present in this movie is wasted, and every little talent left for this turkey is scattered. If you want to watch something as unbearable with gloom, with a lot of the same childhood baieturism, watch one of the Ilsa movies. At least they are unsure of what they are trying to do. How bad has ever been evaluated over 5 years is a miracle of how people who have no taste or standard discernment can sometimes unite for the most dubious purposes. It is not scary, it is not interesting and, above all, does not spark the word in any sense. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horrible offensive and incompetent piece has ever been conceived and given by the resources that will arise, and even more, a tragedy that some still mislead viewers still suspect. <br /> <br /> Not even Elvira's jubilant personality and joker ways could soften the blow that this terrible parody of the movie makes. Avoid it at any cost.
