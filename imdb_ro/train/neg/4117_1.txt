Two days after I saw this, I'm still in agony about seeing it. It's so bad, you have to ask how anyone could write this buzz, the less it allows to get away from the general public. Actor acting, a leading man who seems to be sleepwalker, and Alison Eastwood is embarrassing. Action is recommended for creating budget-low movies, which means it's painfully bad. Parcel? If you were six, then you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and simply blades.
