The cat in the livestock is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as the Hat Cat is not even funny and Mike Myers could not have been worse. This is the worst movie he ever wore. The act and the story were just terrible. I want to say how Dr. Seuss's most beloved stories could be done in the movie and be one of the worst movies of all time and such a disappointment. I could not have seen a movie worse than that, maybe, maybe, Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how bad the movie made. Bo Welch should be fired or the writer must. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's Perspective: 0/10 Without Stars F
