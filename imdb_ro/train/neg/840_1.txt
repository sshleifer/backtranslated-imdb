I totally agree with the last commentator, this could be the worst movie ever made. And I had to move on for most of this film. Michael Madsen must have made this film a favor for somebody. The image quality is grandiose to the end. And how small it is, it's stupid. I give this movie 1 in 10 if I could give her a lower score I would be. Do not waste time on this movie or you will regret it.
