... And I never thought a movie deserved a 1! But this is honest the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife took it because of the distribution, but the story behind the DVD house seemed quite predictable. It's not a mystery or a movie for minors. It does not include any sensuality if the title could remotely suggest any of you. This is just a total no-no. Do not waste your time or money unless you feel you are looking at a bunch of young people in a Gothic setting where a killer goes after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makowski is the worst of Nick Stahl.
