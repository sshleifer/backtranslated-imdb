Oh ... my god ... this is undoubtedly the gentlest movie I've ever seen. The act is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker, and the whole movie does not make sense. Engage this in a mediocre direction, really strange scenes (such as the one in which the child reaches the river and mysteriously falls) and profoundly abisal dialogue ("Look!" "Musta shed his pants!") Failure. Not to mention that the only thing Mr. Atlas says he could overcome is a chocolate case. But that's part of the movie's charm. Stay down and watch him with some of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just so stupid!
