This movie began with some resemblance to a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of characters and random meetings that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to stay connected with this movie. This movie is a very cynical heap of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling skills. It's a bad shocking effort coming from a major studio. Obviously, Disney has moral and motivational issues, not to mention a total lack of supervision and quality control. This management allowed this film to see the light of day talking about their volume of incompetence and despair. This movie fits into my very short list of "The Worst Movie of All Time".
