This movie makes you appreciate the invention of the quick forward button on the remote. It is a boredom refined in beautiful pictures. Once Hamilton goes relatively light on soft focus shots. However, what I found it hard to do about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 years old when shot, the girls are portrayed much younger than they are in reality. Lolita's whole thing, especially since there is an older man, leaves me quite anxious. Heroin is actually raced in the pubic area to make her look even younger than her. Come on, sex is a beautiful past time - between adults who have consented. Another thing we found weird was that neither Beart nor Schüte had a naked scene in the movie, well, not at least a good one.
