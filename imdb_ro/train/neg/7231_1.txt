I have seen this in an artistic cinema that shows "the last days" and some of Charlie Chaplin's films. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I almost came out of this movie and I loved science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city filled with Blade Runner style skyscrapers and some similar debates about cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the script was not condensed enough for a one-hour and forty-five minute film. There are three groups in this world: people, artists and Egyptian gods. Artificial people seem to have the upper hand and control the city's politics. People are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on Khufu's Great Pyramid and completed with a damaged exterior, leaving a smooth glass on the pyramid, would not a perfect futuristic floating pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and no one on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bother you with the so-called plot, but there are many unnecessary ghosts and many rough scenes. The movie, as I said, seems to have been influenced by the Blade Runner and probably by Element Fifth and the Matrix. At the end of the film, thanks were also made to the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who do not speak French. It is therefore obvious that their French dialogue has been called. This is a distraction, and I also thought that going back and forth between people and real animations distracts attention. This does not make animations weak - no better than a video game. Jump over that.
