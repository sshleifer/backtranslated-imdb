This is a typical example of highly skilled technical directors of videos / commercials that are trying to make their first full length movie. On the one hand, the images, the camera, the lighting, the CGI and even the sound are very polished and have a really "expensive" look. Even actors show a certain amount of potential - to the point where even the best action can not conceal a bad plot. In this case, it is not a wrong plot but hardly a plot. So 50% of the dialogues consist of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?". Under no circumstances, any of the characters or the public is offered the slightest suggestion of response. In most of the other dialogues, someone has the feeling that there has never been any form of dialogue, and actors have had to improvise freely on a plot that has never been explained to them. The only reason why Skye Bennet's performance might be so good that her character as a girl with autism did not allow her to be given those horrible, tragic lines of dialogue that the other actors had to deal with. In this way, she was able to show her acting talent that the rest of the cast could not have come close to. I mean there is no actor in the world who can make a dialogue like this: Ben: That's true, is not it? Emily: Stop it. Ben: A mass psychosis, right? Jon: Someone has to take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not by you, not by anyone. And neither of you. Ben: No. <br /> <br /> They took my pockets. But not for horror, more for the horrible attempt. At times, I felt ashamed for the actors who added this to their beef. Two stars for excellent technical work.
