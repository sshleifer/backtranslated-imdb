Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match with very different portraits, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or substantial for her role. Leigh, interpreting the bar singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, is constantly leaning on Georgia, a popular singer in Joni Mitchell's die. Perhaps because of her double co-producer role, Leigh seems to have packed herself in a corner: she is not believable as the singer, and even if it is intentional, she gives too much screen time to the microphone. Perhaps hoping for a touristic force, Leigh is drawn and nervous and shaken; however, we simply do not see any talent in this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she takes the decisions here that stops her from it). If Sadie had even the slightest aspect of charisma or appeal, we might buy in the concept of receiving the (small) breaks he does. As it is, the likelihood that she ever gets up on the stage is thin. Director Ulu Grosbard creates some intense dramatic sequences and the final edition builds Sadie's performance with the art show sold in Georgia - both of them singing the same song - and it's a sad shade ... but what's the point? * 1/2 from ****
