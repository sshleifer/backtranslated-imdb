Fill. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical and toxic culture of a decade ago. In this film, the regrets of the pedestrians for slavery go hand in hand with the colonial subtexts (the annoying redhead that feeds Shaka rice?). Forget the historical reality. No more western slaves came from West Africa? An American killer easily captures Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been worse. Can you just think, like he was in the miniseries? (Immediately after most likely). The miniseries were superb and it is regrettable that DH should have taken their hands on something unique and make it mundane. (I tend to think it was the creation of this fiasco).
