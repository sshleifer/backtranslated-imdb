I'm going to say so much - This director is RAW images ... things that most of us are not ready to face. The images of sex, suicide, murder, and "ease" people continue to bomb the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director is trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I do not think I could ever see this movie, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some pretty pictures and "moments of image" in the movie (the fans, the hair wire), but the story left me much more (strictly since we let ourselves wonder "what the hell did I do we only see? "). <br /> <br /> Note: If you tend to light or vomit slightly ... you do not see this movie.
