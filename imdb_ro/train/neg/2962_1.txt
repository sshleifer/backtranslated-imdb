Movies about dinosaurs can be fun. So, I can film Whoopi Goldberg. But Whoopi and dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes of Theodore Rex, we came to a single conclusion: this movie is bad. Evil, fierce, evil, and condemned to the audience. Nothing of this evil is done accidentally; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. First of all, Whoopi does not do good action movies (watch "Fatal Beauty" if you think he is lying), but movie makers do not worry - he's a tough policeman once again. <br /> <br /> Have we seen a million friends this week? Well, here's a million and a million, buddy. You do not like the cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs of that Spielberg TV show about them? Too bad, here's another, and he's a cop! You one of those people who hates machine chases, shootings, unwanted dialogue, boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax break? A big tax exemption? And you read this review to the end. You REQUEST a sequel. Seriously. No stars, none. And if they really do a sequel to "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole herd of foamed rubber dinosaurs.
