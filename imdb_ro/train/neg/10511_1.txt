Note for Horror fans: The only horror is that when you realize you've just lost 95 minutes of your life in a movie that's so worthless, it's insulting. I looked at this because: <br /> <br /> The premise sounded a little promising: It is not. It's just an excuse to use the same bits of other low-budget slasher films that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of the naked hollows of the woods sounded nice, even if the film turned out to be terrible: It is not. It's not like that. The amateur film ensures that "fallen angels" are as sexy as homeless. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini's name has a long history of horror: He is the king of some budget-specific special effects and acting in a smaller budget. Think about it, Savini should have been a reason not to look at this movie. It's not so bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn and he was milking that at horror conventions ever since. But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a good example of not making a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. Everything is given after the first 10 minutes. But the bold rhythm; how the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a challenge, he thinks no one cares anyway; (undoubtedly added to increase the time to make the film qualify for distribution) shows a total lack of film and storytelling skills in general. This is another good example of the number one way to tell you if a movie will be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, wait for the garbage.
