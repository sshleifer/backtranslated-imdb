Some pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast did not even make any comprehension in Allen's earlier films. And if I have to listen to the unfortunate Will Ferrell, Woody Allen's imitation makes me realize even more about Ferrell (although, though mysteriously, popular). It seems that Allen, aged 70, would have to give up work when the clock sounded in a new century. I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was impossible; my snyapses could not pull him slowly. So, rather than figure out and kill the afternoon sleeping in a vertical position I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where I had a very good book to recite them (the great tone of George Bailey 30 years ago, "Germans.") The day proved rather good after all, not Woody's thanks.
