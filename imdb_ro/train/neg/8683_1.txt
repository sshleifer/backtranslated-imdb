This show is not smart. This is basically what is reduced to. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to pull out to avoid the complete defeat of the rest of the bash world is just unpleasant. In another comment, someone quotes some hilarious lines. Standout for me was George H.W. Bush tells children that he should not see any TV besides Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic. My problem with snoring like this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are getting a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush was not a good president. We all do it. But this is not an excuse to take away this waste of time. I placed these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind the "meet the Spartans". Their formula, bite as many of the current nonfunctional jokes as you can, and throw in the original material worse so you can get your written credit. Again, just bad. Unfunny and makes me increasingly unhappy that nonsense like this is renewed, but amazing and original performances such as Arrested Development are preserved after three solid seasons. Please do not look at these crap, if you're not one of the green-blooded liberals who think any sentence with Bush and dumb word is comedic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All he does is to lightly emulate a Texan accent and exhale very hard at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits that the voices are not accurate. If you want funny political satire, watch the Daily Show / Colbert. Or, look for any political sketches on the chicken robot, which is fun to watch, because action to stop action is extremely well done. Look for George Bush as the Jedi on YouTube. Priceless
