I wish I could give a movie to zero. Effects and action. The only reason to see this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid who plays Brian. What the hell! He could not believe my mullet! Then he spoke to himself. I think it could not just have been silent, but still. Of course they had to have him, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave great performance, compared to the special effects department. Everything from bear to accident was something I could do better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had something to do with the production, considering that the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer has ever read the book, seeing that nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie was like a goat!
