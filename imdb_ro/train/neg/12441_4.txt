Some things need to be clarified. Mark Ferris' image is not Mark Ferris who starred in this film. I know that because he was my father. Remove that image. Also, Mark Ferris was the writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It's been years, and if someone can guide me to get a baby, it would be great. The film was not that bad and trying to compare it to the contemporary world of Star Wars and other high-tech news is useless. If you follow it, enjoy the rediscovery and the humor it possesses. Light up the snob and enjoy some less creative and innovative movies.
