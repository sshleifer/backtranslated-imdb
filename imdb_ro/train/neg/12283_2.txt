College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is affected by the nightmares of a ghoule living in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hand, spitting a worm, opening his ghole and frying over an open fire. After his friends see him levitating "6 feet" over his bed, a disciple-obsessed apprentice (Donna Denton) suggests that he sneaks into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course, they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand! The group gets stuck, Alex Richard's brother (Tom Reilly) becomes possessed and begins to kill everyone. Toni Basil of fame "Mickey" appears as the help ghost of Sammy Mitchell, the singer of the "Bodybag" group. He teaches Alex how to get rid of his body and makes a rock rock dance intertwined with repeated nightmare shooting to eliminate running time. All the victims present themselves as ghosts at Griffin Dunne in an AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The script is full of plot holes, cheeky dialogue, and blade attempts at comedy. Good things about FX and opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that earn merit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Scor: 2 out of 10
