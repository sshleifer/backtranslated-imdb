Life is really too short for such movies. I knew it would not be good when I realized what I was already thinking - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the same type of person he's playing in "Friends". Facing either the guy can play anything other than a nerd or never offers other parts. I have a feeling of being a mixture of both. And I have to say that it is extremely difficult to enjoy a movie that totally destroys the great talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
