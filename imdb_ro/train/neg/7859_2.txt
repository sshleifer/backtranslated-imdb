Dear good. This movie was terrible. I can not complain too much. I went to see him just to be excerpted. It was enough, like that. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was at the very beginning when the woman is extremely forced to give birth to a horribly mutant baby. I also think it funny that the most notable actor in the film was the Spanish soldier, who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie has done a horrible job. There were some of the worst I ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also expected it to be more frightening than the first one. It was not. I expected it to be more frightening because it is a sequel, and the sequels of horror films are usually far less successful than their predecessors. I expected to be more frightening, since gore and violence usually sell a horror film these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was not really the same the scary that the first was still a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The first movie movers were a bit upset, but the filmmakers tried so much to make them angry that they were absolutely hilarious. the whole concept of showing the female soldier's son's video on his camera phone, saying "I love you, mother." FOUR. It was great to show her first because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the other soldiers and it was even worse to continue trying to make us feel even LIGHT for her, three times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
