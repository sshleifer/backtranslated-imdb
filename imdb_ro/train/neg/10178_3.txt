How did I ever appreciate this bastard for a sequel? All he does is throw the balls! The worst of all, does not even compare to the first installment of the series! Comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laugh go? The blow effect on the field goes too long. Bob Uecker literally saved him from a completely new lock. What next, Major League 4: Return to the League? Ehh, it could be! Leave it on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. It had three too many blows.
