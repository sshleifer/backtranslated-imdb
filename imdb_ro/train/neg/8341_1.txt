I like horror movies. I can even appreciate most of the cheese (faced with this, 9 out of 10 horror films today are cheese), but this was just ridiculous. Horrible action, terrible writing, characters completely empty and incredible (not Meisner actors here!) And the total lack of enough bodies. I would like to save the 79 minutes of my life that I just wasted. At least Crooks are well-known. The only good thing about the whole movie was to look at Alicia Silverstone who wants to be punched in front. How did it succeed to Sundance for me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even by slasher movie standards. Really, come back! Who would rush to get a cheap ink 10 seconds after a creepy stalker just left his door? Lame.
