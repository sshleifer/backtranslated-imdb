This is certainly one of the worst movies ever made. Every scene is painful. You will master the limited attempts of humor, the dishonest work of the camera, sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, the wood act. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the film that is not a jena. In all, terrible.
