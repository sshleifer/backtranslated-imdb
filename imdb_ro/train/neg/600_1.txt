...... in a horror movie that is. First, start with Kate. His main goals include getting George Clooney, who looks good and, last but not least, cheating on everyone. He has to love her. He had about 3 amazingly good chances to end this sick man, but he fled. I mean, he did not want to bring Guy for 10 minutes and when he did too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I want to say who would be sincere to have sympathy for a guy who finishes everybody he met one night. The movie continues. And as a result, he lost all credibility.
