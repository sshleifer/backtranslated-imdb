In many of the films I saw on Warren Oates, I came to a clear conclusion, here is a talented individual. I saw Mr. Oates in the 1960s TV series called Stoney Burke. Since then, I have followed my career closely and felt it is meant for great roles. That happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him the best billing in a movie called "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia." Of course, his biggest claim to his fame was his magnificent role in The Wild Bunch. I always thought he was able to bring some character to some magic until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler," a tribute to the 1950s detectives made by Raymond Chandler. Because the synopsis said it was a rough, private nose eye, I was immediately interested. Nevertheless, I sat patiently in the whole movie and realized that it was a dull boring, disagreeable, slow, twisted, confused, which, if it had a theme or a plot, should have stayed on a dark self. Collectively and with some of the best Hollywood stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach five. Where. As a result, one of my favorite actors was stuck in a badly made vehicle that never came down from the ground. **
