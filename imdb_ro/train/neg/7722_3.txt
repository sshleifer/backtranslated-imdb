The extremely poor film in which Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee have played, who have been caught in a secondary role that never seems to gel. The action is in the best way, a bit of nudity chucked and giving Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> Set-up is the usual renegade policeman forced to break a new partner on a big case, decision makers at least try to make a twist by making Lundgren the policeman with Oriental values ​​and Lee the modern town slicker , but there is a zero character development, which makes it almost comical, the Oriental Lundgrens warrior's equipment for the big showdown must be seen to be believed. Action sequences are the numbers, and Lee (who will continue to make The Crow excellence) never has the opportunity to show a special glow in the martial arts. But given his illustrious existence, he must have been under much pressure and was much better served without having to live up to his father, taking on a very different role in The Crow, who showed what actor becoming unique if not for his tragic and early death. If your a Lundgren hardcore fan or a fan of 80's poor action movies (think Cobra etc.) then avoid. <br /> <br /> Slab 3/10
