Anyone who has seen the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast, script, and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. It's also easy to see how the opposite can create another type of Hollywood insipid! This movie was pathetic! If it had not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have been out for about 15 minutes in this terrible celluloid waste. Neil Simon will not write another scenario for this version that he can not improve first) and I am surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he will not sue for defamation of humor! Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis have done such a wonderful job as the original, what were the producers thinking about when they did this? How could the director and publisher look at these scenes and believe that any one of them was fun? I do not know, but one thing I know --- it's no surprise why foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
