This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have seen. He is not sure if the writer of the script read or not Bronte's book. George C Scott is ridiculous and fumbling like Rochester - when he's just not just old angry. Susannah York has the biggest hairstyle in the 1970s that I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. Characters barely talk to each other, so the rich banter rejoices in the book underlying the profound intellectual and hidden love, disappears. The conclusion is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version. It's so true for the book, it's like having a novel read aloud for you. Dalton is great as Rochester. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
