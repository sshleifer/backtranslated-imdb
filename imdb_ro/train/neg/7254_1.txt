Who ever wrote the two or three brilliant reviews, whether they were involved in making this film, the term was used freely, either the bank ran it, and if that was the case, I would like seven bucks back ! The actors, again freely used term, are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything again, which is a relief. The scenery and everything about these screams, we had $ 7 to work and a day to do it. Was this filmed in the back yard? Everything about this project says, low budget. At best, the actors were list D. Do not waste your time unless, of course, you want to take it back and try to get the rent back. The evil lead man looks like the punk of the 1970s showdown that ended with marriage to his grandmother dummee moore. My local video store, which belongs to a blockbuster, shows this as the most filmed movie with a sad comment attached. Even as a 99-cent rent, this tab gathers dust. Someone should have some favor. This is a super stinker and gives her 10 turds.
