What made the idea of ​​seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the classic original story. I was deeply disappointed that this film, which seemed to be written or shot in haste, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witches of the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seem to be either scrawled or left on the floor. Also lacking was the charismatic sense of Jane Eyre, which allowed her to suffer through her turbulence and triumph over everywhere. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie does not seem to have much to triumph, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame of having to ask for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, everything to get rid of a man she loved was, in my opinion, some perverse parts of the story that they were just leaving this movie. The character of the title seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unattractive and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story would be a little interesting. The script and the Direction did not do much if they had any credit for the classic story.
