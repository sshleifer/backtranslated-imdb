This is so incredibly bad. Weak actors. You can say that they're trying hard to polish their flock, but we all know you can not. Writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to watch her try to sell it. Humor and rhythm are so worked, it is hard to believe that any of these good actors have signed up for it. That being said, it is so terrible that we strive to look carefully at the screen. We need to know where this train is going. But that's just because I got it on TV. If he actually paid for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars to be at least funny / fascinating. And the incidental music (as opposed to the indie musical column that tries to be too hard) is a re-enactment of a Scooby-Doo episode ... but not as good.
