The underside of the cylinder, the unimaginable and virtually undeclared remake of ROUTE WAR. This movie follows the film exactly like the STRYKER film from the Philippines and is worse off! Bad action, dialogue, effects, duplication, pacing, action sequences ... Continuous and continuous list. Italy literally did dozens of road wars in the early 1980s, some good, some bad. This is the worst by far, no contest. Not only the mood of the film was completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through it is a half-boredom. It was a good follow-up to the beginning of the movie and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade explosion. But everything else about this serious movie is back! For the real post-nuke fun, go down a copy of ENDGAME after the fall of New York, or BRIGHT EXCURSION instead. They're much more enjoyable than this garbage.
