As a film critic for several Dutch sites, I have to see many movies and not all the very good ones. Some movies are so bad, you will not be surprised to be broadcasting directly on the video. With taboos, I'm surprised that it's released on video at all. This is really low-budget poor quality bad waste writing. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a taboo game. They write their wish or worst act, and later people are killed for taboo. The question is, should we believe what we see? The movie has an interesting plot-twisting potential, and I will not give it here. But what might have been interesting remains poor, badly acted, and for no reason whatsoever. Some of the actors have played in higher titles before, why why did they sign up for it? If you see this anywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, no quality human sense in this movie.
