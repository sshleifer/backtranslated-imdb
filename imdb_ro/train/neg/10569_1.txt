I tried to see the movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and tell you that you would follow anything under these circumstances. It's not this piece of sh * t, though. The first five minutes set the tone by the poor quality of pornographic movies, strange plotting and unbelievable situations and behaviors. It gets worse afterwards. This movie has no single saving grace, and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it fun to look. It's horrible. I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those connoisseurs of snobs, that is, I will enjoy most of the movies to some extent even if they are bad. This man ... man. Get away from this, buddy.
