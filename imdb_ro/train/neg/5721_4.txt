I was not at all a fan of the 2005 "gore fest" hits hit, and most of these bottom bumps are just as bad or bad - yet "Live Feed" managed to keep me somewhat entertained for the first 30 minutes. Beginning with a lot of sex and crazy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese organized crime group and a seven-meter-long butcher with skin ... What took me out of the movie was the tough "gun hero" and a rescue of the day ... I would call this film mediocre, at best, because a premise that mainly involves the young man being killed in a porno porn theater, doubling as a maze hideress, calls me to me. If only torture was long enough to be effective, my assessment would have been very different. Unfortunately, most of the boredom is buried in a single scene, leaving the rest of the film to end as a revenge scenario. So in principle, it's just a low-budget "Hostel" rip-off with the use of free, almost constant sex redeeming in the first half of the movie ... In general, I would say do not bother with it.
