Here's one you can follow with a straight face, with such a bad scenario, even Will Ferrell would not be in it. There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. Punch-Dance. Rod "has to go to his quiet place," and before anyone can tell Kevin Bacon, he takes a step to keep his body, accompanied by a band that wants them to have a hairpin in Europe . > <br /> 2. John Farnham's You The Voice. In one of those epic sequences where the star and cohorts make The Slomo Walk on Main Street and the cities follow their heels in their support, the soundtrack is gag. How did the filmmakers even get this Aussie recording artist? A great Australian vocalist (and a true talent) who won the fame in the early 70s, covering Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, the anthem of John Farnham is so brave, made up mountains in Switzerland. Besides these two high points of the film - both ruined in anyway with the slipshod writings - the rest of the film is like choking someone else's vomit. <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, a stuntman who has never made a jump. Maybe it has something to do with driving a moped into the heart of darkness. Or his false mustache. Yeah, somebody thought it was funny. Without a jump in his belt of stars, he plans an extravagance of 15 buses - which would certainly kill a worse comedian, such as Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save the stepfather and wipe at the same time cancer and anything ... what these movies are about to be plotting anyway? Along the way (as usual for the moron lead in these comedies), he scores a sanctuary chicken (Isla Fisher), who must be late to consider changing chromosomes with this loser. Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost called her show - then she changed her mind and closed. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
