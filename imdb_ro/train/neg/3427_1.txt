This must have been an embarrassment for every member of the entire African-American show. Every worrying, disgraceful stereotype of the American black community is prominently presented. I will not reinforce insults by registering them here, except pigeons, watermelon and dice. A good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad guys), as well as the 8-year-old Sammy Davis's fantastic song and dance talent bring everything under 1 on the IMDb scale.
