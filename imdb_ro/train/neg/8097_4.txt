Considered by many critics to be one of the greatest stinkers of all time (certainly the greatest noise of Brian De Palma's career). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a rich boy whose life goes in pieces when he and his girlfriend Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story is characterized by another man, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). Well, as I said in my summary ... What should this film have to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly does not add too much. It is undermined by unimaginably cumbersome, one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have the discontent to meet you in real life. I am not a great fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I could not finish it because it did not please), but it is obvious to me that those who did / enjoy this novel consider this movie is a complete crossword. seen so many talented actors strive to make it hard to give a film below the average some appearance of quality and failure. What issues. <br /> <br /> Problems start with the casting of a nice guy, Tom Hanks, in a role that is supposed to be inconsequential. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a British. Bruce Willis is bad, crazy in the role. What was the thought there. Unfortunately, not even Morgan Freeman can get rid of the movie with his innocent dignity, forcing himself to give up a lazy, a tedious story of "decency" after the climax. /> <br /> This movie turns into an absurd farce. I liked the assembly of talent; because I will give him four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a better film of the source material could be made.
