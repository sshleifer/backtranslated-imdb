Look carefully at the wonderful talent line put together to make this film: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, and even Samec, Lange and Plimpton. They prove, in beatings, that a bad scenario can not be saved. The story line requires so many leaks from the public that its implausibility should have even surpassed Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and the "twists" are really crude.
