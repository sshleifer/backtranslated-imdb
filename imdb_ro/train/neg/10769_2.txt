I found this on the shelf while taking care of me and getting bored. How can people give this a 10? It's not just that it should be a ransom movie (I think), because it does not work at this level as well. Low statue, bad dialogue, terrible action; there is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has no reason to work, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to go in a certain way and do it without writing the bits needed to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life, you'll never come back.
