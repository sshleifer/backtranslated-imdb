If there ever was a movie that deserves a high zero rating, it's a bunch of nonsense. I like zombie movies and even the bad ones usually have something for them, but not this atrocity. Actually I started to feel upset watching this movie because it is so insulting to the poor, I can not believe that the people responsible for this would think this is acceptable. There is no plot, with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act or resemble in any way with human beings. The whole film is also shot in two vaguely decorated rooms to resemble the places where they should be. The whole thing is a useless mess, it does not go anywhere, and when the zombies finally return, they look at garbage and do not do much. I was able to make a better movie than that, so you could and could have someone who has never seen a movie before. It is pitiful and undoubtedly the worst film of all time. Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice that the only positive reviews give this on 10/10 and I urge you to buy the DVD. I can not imagine that someone neutral really thinks it's a good movie, it's terrible. 0/10 and that's generous.
