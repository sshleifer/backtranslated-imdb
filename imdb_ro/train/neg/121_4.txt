Anyone who wrote the screenplay for this movie never met a book about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have not seen so many mistakes in a biopic, from the early years of Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go further for the pages. In all, I think Lucille Ball is one of those enchanted people who simply can not be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would have been irritated by how many mistakes were made in this film. Manufacturers have tried hard but the movie seems terrible.
