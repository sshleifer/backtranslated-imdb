I looked at the bottom 100 of Imdbs because I thought that id never saw anything as bad as plan 9 in the outerspace or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur both beat. This from the countless countless movies I've seen is the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad Direction, Bad Characters, Horrible Act, Horrible story There's a reason for anyone, but Sam ever says something positive about this movie. Sam was a terribly annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he could just overturn Ed Wood. The director should be ashamed of his work, unfortunately, I have to give him at least one star, but it is worth - to be starry.
