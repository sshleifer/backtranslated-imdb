What Irish critics give this film is beyond me. Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors fired for every Irish film. Terrific scene with forced characters (brown sauce). Romanticize everything that is bad about Dublin. The attitude "ah, is a garbage pit, but it is certainly not great". Lots of noises simply for the American audience (supermarket head and its overwhelming phrase). And the coffin nail was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor forced to play this part that could have been written by the age of five. A trusted thing. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you have to say that. Well, at least did not put his frightening American accent. The international audience should be warned: stay home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better moment. The ban is a walk-out
