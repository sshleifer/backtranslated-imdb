This movie is trying hard, but it does not have the fun of the TV series in the 1960s that I'm sure people remember with love. Although I am 17 years old, I watched part of the series on YouTube long ago and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film makes little justification for the series. The special effects are rather unsatisfactory, and this was not helped by flat-panel work. The script was also boring and had no sense of wonder and humor. Other sub-parody scripts are Home Alone 4, Cat in Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. Now I will say that I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran steam too early, and I am not sincerely sure that this is something the family can enjoy. And I was annoyed by the speech suit despite the Wayne Knight's spiritual voice work. But the thing that made me most nervous about this movie was that she lost the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all the talented actors. Jeff Daniels fired some good shows but did not seem to know what to do, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley lived unhappily. Daryl Hannah is a beautiful actress and was generally ignored and liked the idea that she is the interest of love, but unfortunately you see very little of it (not to mention that the attack on Monster is frightening children than to annoy them) Shawn is a sort of governor. Christopher Lloyd gets better and as actor I really like Lloyd (he was in two of my favorite Clue and Framed Roger Rabbit films and I like Back to the Future), but he's got a little work, and had a tendency to survive quite wildly. Generally, as much as I wanted to like this movie, I was left unprinted. Instead of being fun, it has become a futility, and that's a shame because it has a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted by a bad execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
