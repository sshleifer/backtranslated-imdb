Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. You do not even get into your car and you think you could see this movie if others do not call you. If you have to watch a movie this weekend, visit Batman again. The scenario was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Considering: a place in closed spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to discover all the clues that honorable police officers can not put together and an innocent and extremely curious but beautiful and strong woman with which many in the audience would like to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add a very badly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some weirdos there for a small "spin" in the plot. The act was horrible, and the characters were unbelievable - Borat was more credible than that. *** Spoiler *** And can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after it was shot without even making the person who was shot flinch ??? I'm in the army. We need such things for ourselves. 1 in 10 and put it in that rounded decimal place to give the lowest score possible.
