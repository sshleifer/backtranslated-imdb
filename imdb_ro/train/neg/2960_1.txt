This is undoubtedly the worst film ever created the worst. There is no argument here. This is. The end of the story. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, showing that it was created by a three-year old fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply stupid. It's inconceivable how someone can come up with something so stupid and think it was fun. The jokes are also completely blades. If you have not seen this movie yet, be sure you are lucky. If your morbid curiosity about how bad this movie is, please do not make me describe it. Words can not express how horrible this movie is. This is not just bad as a bad movie. Even they have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story you've ever had and multiply its level of evil by 5,000, and you have not yet gotten near the horror of this movie. After I gave Pokemon the movie a point, giving him a single point of this film, he seems to have nothing to do with charity. It's so bad. Producers and directors even took film classes? Because this is a perfect example of not making a movie. Apparently an amateur with a high paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, take it back and ask for a refund. And you do not even think of renting it again.
