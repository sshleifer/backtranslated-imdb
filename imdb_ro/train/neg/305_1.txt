I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr.Sandler became famous. It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a painful home movie. I liked a lot of other movies ... ... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from it. It can change your thoughts on Adam. You may never recover from the horror that is this movie .... We had a better time watching the elders play scrabble in a home .......
