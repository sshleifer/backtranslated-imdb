Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duoes in history, and deservedly, so I'm happy to see any of their movies. Basically, a man from a horn factory is the fourth to break, and quite quickly Ollie cracks with all the horn sounds. He rests at home with Stan beside him, needs quiet, and doctor (James Finlayson) calls to say he comes to check Ollie. After completing the plumbing and electricity is confused by a cross-eye repairer, the doctor goes in for a check and, after a few tests, recommends drinking goat's milk and taking some sea air out of the ocean. After Stan uses trumpets, hanging the window through the telephone line and a car accident, he and Ollie head for a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock, trying to milk a goat, and Stan brought the trumpet! Meanwhile, the first newspaper page reads that Killer Nick Grainger - The Escapat Convict (Richard Cramer) escaped, and he sneaks into boys' boats while sleeping, and the goat chews through the rope, floating in the sea. In the morning, I see where he is, and Killer goes out for food and he shows Stan and Ollie making fake food, spaghetti cloth, cheese soap, bacon straw, sponge cake, and forcing them to eat. When Ollie starts to blow, Stan hits the trumpet to help him, and Ollie's fury makes him hit the killer and continues until the police arrive, just to get Ollie's anger into jail. There were the smallest comedy moments, but it's not a big black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice move you brought me!" was the number 60 on 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number seven Comedy comedian. Good!
