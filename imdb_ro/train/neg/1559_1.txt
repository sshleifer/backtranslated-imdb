This may be the worst movie I'll see if I'm 100 years old. I think a group of first grade students could have come up with better plot lines than a class project than that. I'm unlucky because I watched her and God pity the souls who were paid to produce this film. And after I finally stopped it, I actually had the need to vomit. /> <br /> Nobody had a photo idea when she did that. Nobody had any idea about acting. Nobody had any clue about anything about anything. I can not believe F / X shows this shit occasionally. The only time I saw her was Starz! channels - not even one main one. And it was about 3 am.
