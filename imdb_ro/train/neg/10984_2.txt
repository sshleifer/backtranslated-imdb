I watched this movie for the two hours and I have no idea what it is about. Someone was killed or maybe they did not, and maybe someone did or maybe they did not. This brought good memories (bad days) when all Canadian films from CBC were stinkers. Lately, stinkers have been the exception, but this subtle confusion of fashionable feminism, the mind spinning back and the mumbled dialogue makes the lost time. I did not find Margaret Atwood's books readable. This film continues that Canadian tradition. It's not easy to watch. Maybe fashion people at cocktail parties in chi chi will pretend they liked it. Our boonies are a bit more demanding.
