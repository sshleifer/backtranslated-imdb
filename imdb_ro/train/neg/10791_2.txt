Horrible movie. If there is a Turkish film, you should avoid seeing in 2006, which should be Banyo. What a waste of time. In addition to some cheap smiles, this film does not touch anything, lure, zilch, nil. Dialogue is cheap, and sex clich√©s are everywhere. The director has to watch several movies before trying to straighten his own story. Red-headed women have examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad action. The only good thing I can say about the film is wait, wait, I can not say anything about it. I probably did not like to write about it so much. Lord!
