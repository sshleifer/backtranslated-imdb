Of course, this movie sucks. But let's examine why. The suggestion that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it and then transporting it and reassembling it is less interesting. But that's the way I get this premise. Instead of returning to what might happen if someone did this type of car, they break the curse. This could have been a good premise. To live with the responsibility of this type of power and to deal with constant temptation, that is, invisible man. But they do not ... They break the curse. And Lembach wants to leave. So, the doctor is head back and tries to transport himself. Only to confront his beautiful but stupid secretary (spirit). What would not have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they would not give money. Wah. Then, to make the film worse, cast into a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent teachers hired to help him. Between their loving sessions, I do some half-hearted attempts to find him while killing half of London. All this would have been back by not break the damn car, which would not have happened if Lembach would not have gone. This film tried to give an honest two stars for effort, but it would have been better if he had broken away miserable, making Lembach to leave, causing him to try again. Damn it, Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
