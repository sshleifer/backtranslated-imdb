Cinema tourism has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folk, but they want to become international. This brings kitsch results, like this movie. The film has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and they have no sense for the non-Turkish audience. Even for the Turkish public after 10 years. Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have a weaker action than the average. They behave like dolls. The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. So Cuba is thought of as a republic of bananas. Loss of money, loss of time.
