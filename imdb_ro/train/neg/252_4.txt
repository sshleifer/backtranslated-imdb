The uninspired direction leaves a decent scene, extinguished in a beautiful but gentle adaptation, where the dialogue seems to be recited rather than the heart, and the appearances of ghostly money fail to round out any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the present Spirit of Christmas, is spinning on his leg and seems to make an impression on Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too bad, and never seems to really believe in him, which breaks his performance effect. Scenes in which he has shown his past have such a great impact as if he had half-heartedly awakened his family album. Nobody else seems to make any effort, except for Frank Finlay, which goes beyond the chronology.
