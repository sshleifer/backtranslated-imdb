Essentially, a man's story about nature, this movie has a beautiful cinema, the lush jungles of Ceylon and Elizabeth Taylor's presence, but the movie never works. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later attracted by the plant master, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of late father Peter Finch's owner, whose ghost raises a height on the Walk Elephant, which becomes a major point of discussion between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to recover their traditional waterway that was blocked when the mansion was built in their right-of-the-way. The beasts are fighting and offer the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as they struggle to remain a faithful wife, despite the family difficulties with Finch.
