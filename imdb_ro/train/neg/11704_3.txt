One of them: "Why was this done?" movies. Romanticism is very difficult to swallow. It is one of these romances, that, suddenly, "click" - they are in love. The film is full of long breaks and unpleasant moments - the restaurant with the engine being the most notable. Charles Grodin makes a credible job, but for most of the film he's just Louise Lasser. Ask, do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for about an hour and a half?
