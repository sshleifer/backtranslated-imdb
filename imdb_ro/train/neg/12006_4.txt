OK Director Returns LOVE ACTUALLY Director Nikhil Advani after his debut with KHNH makes the second half and waits <br /> <br /> He makes a movie of 3:30 hours + losing patience, time.etc The viewer seems to be a 3 Sleep hours watching this movie OK had 6 stories, so it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? We have the story of Anil-Juhi convincing, but boring, not TV shows show such stories? We have the story of Govinda- Shannon that is fun and works well <br /> <br /> We have the story of Akshaye-Ayesha again credible, but it gets boring soon and the focus is more on comedy and comedy too boring. We have the story of Salman-Priyanka that is the worst, not just the terms of action, it makes no sense. We have the story of Sohail-Isha to make you laugh and the trick sometimes works because of the boredom set by most other stories <br /> <br /> We have John-Vidya's story a good story from all points of view < > <br /> But then, until all the stories come in pieces, the spectator gets bored and asleep. Temperament is not particularly attractive. Salman-Priyanka's climax. The story of Nikhil Advani is good in some places, some stories are well handled but weak in places Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs The cinema is beautiful, every story is given a different look, texture and works Govinda Rocks actors, after a comeback of BB layout actually makes you laugh and to love him in this film, despite the age and weight of Anil Kapoor acting well, though he looks in shape and tired John excels in his part, Akshaye Khann to upset for a change Sohail Khan is too over-top and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for this movie you're shocking? Salman Khan does not only act, he just talks that he is in the sleep and that fake accent that god Priyanka exceeds such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she does not do better towards the end of Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla it's okay Shannon's okay
