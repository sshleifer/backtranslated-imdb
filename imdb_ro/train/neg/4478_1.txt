I did not expect too much for this movie - a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a plausible and insightful, melodramatic and intriguing modern story. But this film has decided to cast out the talents of the people involved in a simplistic version so wet by the source material that it is amazing that they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights at all. She ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially inappropriate, especially unsatisfactory and often cruel to each other. It changes the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, did not have a conniving bone in her body - stripped off their blind idealism and turned it into a scheming slut. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychologically tortures most people in his own way, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving his daughter in his care. The dialogue is tricked and wonders how the actors have managed to deliver any of them with straight faces. Instead of real depths or real emotions, we know they mean something when they scream at one's face. I have read criticism of the version of Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights," which included Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned a dark, gothic dark story into a bunch of corsets. The little-valid comments, but the MTV version goes one step further, using the basic story structure to provide beach sticks that crash really bad music.
