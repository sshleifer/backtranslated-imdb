Men, I like the police movies stuffed with action, shooting, chase and more. Well, I was disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. I have seen everything before, the hostages, the bank, the surroundings ... However, two bad guys throwing more officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without being hit by Kevlar. <br /> Not just a few photos, not hundreds of photos. Turning back to the bench, where the dissatisfied hostages did not block the safety or the doors when the bad boys came out. How bad the director thought we would be. Okay, the photos between that fake documentary were good, but after seeing the movie, I just thought: why did not the police get it? a decent shooting course? And why there were so many policemen and there was a SWAT on a long long break. Really bad.
