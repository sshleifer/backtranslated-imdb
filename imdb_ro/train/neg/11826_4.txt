There is something sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something trying to do something very different ... and being mediocre. I thought Jordan would play baseball, but the same is true for Steve Martin. This movie is reasonably well-directed and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a great job to adapt a classic story to a comedy in Roxanne, but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene turns into a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story updated with a certain style, you'd better rent the "Great Expectations".
