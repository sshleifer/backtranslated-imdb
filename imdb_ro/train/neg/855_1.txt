It's not the best of the movies to be seen today. I've read many reviews about Shining and I expected to be very good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and the environment were good, but it was not a story here. There was no moment of fear. I was expecting a horror thriller, but there was no horror thriller. The only scene I was scared of was during the scene of changing the chapter showing "Wednesday". There are many fragments of the movie. Most things are left inexplicable without anything to bind them to anything. The story does not tell us about women or other scenes that are shown. It can be a good movie to watch in the 80's but not for the 21st century.
