I like watching early-color movies - you mean 40-year-old clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her "eccentric" clothing is actually quite attractive and yes, it has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel his head was too busy. Probably developed this characterization in many shows and nobody said "If she laughs, let her go out." It makes too many disturbing mistakes when it should be surprising on earth. Madame Arcati's show is that the environments were usually portrayed as strange females in long drapes. Arcats behave like a chair of retirees (we will really put our backs on!). The contrast between her breezy and ordinary manner and her odd beliefs is not at all excluded. Just because all the actors are English (except for Cummings), Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "Rigid", "Lips" and "Upper". Give him a rest! The three main characters constantly lose their fears and make remorse remarks (Has he made love with you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
