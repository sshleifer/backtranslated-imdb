Unfortunately, we made a mistake and paid 7 euros at the cinema to watch this movie meaningless. My Goals; The film is based on 2 things; 1) Ethnic view: As happens in most American films, the writer is considered an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunafe and 2 names of other foods does not make a person understand a culture. For example, laughter is the sign of a clean life in Asia, but everyone was trying to stop it. People in Lebanon are Christians (they have received this well), and their forms and beliefs and cultural approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western cultures is that we do not make ethnocentrism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our lives, as did the father in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual Revolution of a Girl: There is nothing to say about it. Show me 10 girls who have sexually awake than I say I'm wrong. I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the movie in the genre of black humor. You look at Dr.Strangelove and you understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor has to reflect the truth and must focus on the audience in its funny parts. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie?
