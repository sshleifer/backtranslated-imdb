The idea was great, the actors were incredible, the story could be very frightening, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I could not really get into this movie. I could not feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie ends up very strange. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Again, I do not know. Let the theater feel uncomfortable. The film had so much to give, but it could not. Just because you can edit does not mean you should, right? I would not recommend this movie because you can not say that you let the movie feel as if it had been completed. You will be confused. Believe me, you probably will thank me if you do not look at this movie. 3/10
