What a terrible movie. I can not believe I lost 90 minutes of my life watching this. Tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer have played in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The music background has to say that it did not match AT ALLL with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in creating a good and balanced film. I hope that in the future no director so horrible as it would have been, could ever destroy such a classic movie. This movie should not have been made in the first place. A tip for all who saw him, please tell me I'm right, because I could not be the only spectator who did not enjoy it. BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 of 10.
