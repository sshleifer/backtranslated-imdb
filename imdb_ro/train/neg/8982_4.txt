My nose is slightly bent in shape when I write this. I've sent a previous comment on this movie a few weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I suppose it was rejected even if it complied with all the usual recommendations. We found this thrilling film for the first time thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in important productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also good enough. Unfortunately, everything sinks ultimately under the weight of a truly horrible, melodramatic scenario. There is also an abundance of free nudity that does nothing to promote the narrative or to even borrow an impressionist hue for what otherwise is a beautiful piece of art. A real beach trip to Valencia is far less difficult than having to meet these fictional characters again anytime, anytime.
