This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, the act (especially Affleck) is the weakest. Ben Affleck's fans will probably defend this film, but deep down must agree. As far as I could gather the plot of Ben Affleck, a millionaire vendor, a psychiatrist is told to go to a place to remember his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from childhood. In this sense, he stops paying the family who currently lives in the house to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually meets with the family's daughter ... blah blah blah.
