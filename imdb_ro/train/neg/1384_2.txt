Jet Li, is one of the world's best hand combat fighters. He has been over 20 years old and puts others in shame. While he is great in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US. Black Mask should be a breakout movie for him, but he does not get horrible. First, it is called. Although it can have value in the camp (doubling is not even close and it is in red tone), it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, is doing a horrible job. He cuts off scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Sometimes the camera shakes and turns. Fans see Jet Li's fantastic martial arts. However, the director is editing scenes so fast that you do not even know who is half the time! As a matter of fact, a scene is left hanging (that is, Li begins to cut a hole in a jeep floor while badguys arms his arms, two seconds later both Li and love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so improbable that I'm going over the point of being completely ridiculous (Roma murderers of CDs, just give Throwing Stars !!!!). Li, he needs a director who is less prone to cutting machines and more to create a cinematic scene. Added rap / techno music goes from being good to intrusion. The land has possibilities, but they are all scattered with cartoon cartoons that take away any credibility that this film strives for. And are we really to believe that love's interest will not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask? Would not the hair, the lower jaw or the voice give it up? If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin temple. This disordered mess is a complete loss of time ... 2/10
