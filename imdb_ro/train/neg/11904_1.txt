The end of the violence and, of course, the Million Dollar Hotel suggested that Wenders lost his vision, his ability to tell convincing stories through a map of the moving image. Country Plenty seals the coffin, I'm afraid, being an extremely unimaginable film, obviously sentimental and cliseal. Characters are completely flat and stereotyped, writing, plot, and direction are amateur at best. For the first time in a fairly long period, I was anxious to finish the movie so I can continue life. The devastation of his uncle's warfare, the patriotic abstract looking up at the end ... just struck me as so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a director who once made a convincing magic on the screen. What happened? Experimental days, perceptual writing and exciting filmmaking possibilities are long behind him, I'm afraid. Let's hope he finds his inspiration again ... At the Toronto film festival, where I saw the movie, Wenders was there to present it. Completely unpopular, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid it could not be worse ...
