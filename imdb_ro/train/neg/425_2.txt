I can not believe I'm so upset after seeing that I'm about to write my first review of IMDb. This Disney documentary is nothing but a revised earth Earth lite. Now I knew that it was announced that "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I did not have the idea of ​​using exactly the same reductions as the revolutionary mini-series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already have on DVD. Shame on Disney because you do not warn people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a voice by James Earl Jones and 90 seconds of sailfish that I do not think were on planet Earth). the greatest murder of all is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took this story and turned it into a ghost friendly for family. After the death of the male polar bear, they show their chickens raised a year later, and throw some garbage on how they are ready to remember their memories and that the earth is indeed a beautiful place. No mention of raised youngsters that could endanger death because of the same trouble their father has endured, without warning of trouble for future generations, if we do not take the act together, nothing. Just a set of things I've already seen along the movie (and many times more if you're one of the billions of people who've already seen Planet Earth). ashamed and deceived in my life.
