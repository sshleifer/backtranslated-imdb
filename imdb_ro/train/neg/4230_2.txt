Okay, I like B movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But it's just terrible. I'm amazed that he has such a decent global score. The only redeeming qualities of this film are the (most) marginal splash effects. Do not get me wrong, the gorilla abounds in this movement - but few effects really jumped at me (like the anal probe ... which was great!) I think this movie was shot on a video camera. C'mon - Rent a Betacam at least, I saw pigeons with better production values ​​(and better acting as well). Acting - suck! But not in the way of Troma or in the Full Moon style. Story - contrived! But that's what you get from movies like these. Very weak! <br /> <br /> Sets & Props - suck! My 16-year-old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween. Dubbing and dialogue - suck! Any horrible voice (I should not even call it to act) and any other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". There are tons of good class horror and B / splatter escapes there and they are not so hard to follow. Do yourself a favor without wasting time with these crap!
