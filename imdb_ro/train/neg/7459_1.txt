save money and visit something else. this movie was a piece of shit. I did not want to go, but I had to think I'd laugh at least once, NOPE. no laughter, it was horrible! chris kattan will never get a good comedy after this and "a night at roxbury". this movie is absolutely obvious, has no clever humor and is always repeated. listen to me, and strive you as far away from this movie as you can!
