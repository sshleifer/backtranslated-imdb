This movie seems to have been made for television. We have been waiting for years to make a film about Rubin Carter, because I liked to see him in the old MSG and see this movie very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but it was terrible and boring. It's nothing good to say about this movie, except I liked the song.
