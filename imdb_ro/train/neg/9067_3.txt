Although I had some hopes for this movie, especially because I'm so happy with the fact that I'm doing Freak & Geeks, Undeclared, I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever had, I have seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and women are also on this list). Yes, there were some laughs, though the movie could have been much better. The premise was not that deceiving artists would cheat their way through college meeting their match when they were discovered by someone with a proposal for them. The problem is that the characters were so steadfast that I did not care about any of them. The blackmail (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was a psychopath who was not so fun to look at - he was not disturbed in a particularly amusing or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, it's not fun to get look. Editing the film was hard to follow - he continued to cut between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear what it was. Only two or three of the band's scams were really demonstrated, you just had to think that they are really deceiving artists - showing that their schemes would have made for a better film. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was stupid and badly written and straightened all the way. I could say about the shortcomings of the movie, but you have an idea. It's not worth the rent of $ 4 or the gas required to drive to and from the movie store to rent!
