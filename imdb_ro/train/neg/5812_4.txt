"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction "who is struggling for their rights ever since Adam and Eve began the free-leaf system." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only ten years old. The film deals with the exercise of political power by women as a voting group. Adopting the ban and closing of the replies was a major concern for women at that time. Marie Dressler of Good Nature (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed out of a speakeasy. He wants to close the liquor sales; and, is being drafted in a mayor's term, after sending a strong speech to a rally of women. Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenants, her best friend, Polly Moran (Ivy Higgins) and her embarrassing husband, Roscoe Ates (Peter Higgins). Dressler's flight to the mayor of Lake City attracts the opposition of men in the city; Dressler orders women to make mistakes, denying "everything" in the "salon, bedroom, and bathroom." <br /> <br /> The movie sounds a lot better than it turned out. Humor, honestly, is not good; and has some dysfunctional and modern offending situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to an Amos and Andy character). And the mixture of shots and sparkles does not mix well, this time. Producers would have thought the film was more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (Myrtle Burns). / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Maria Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
