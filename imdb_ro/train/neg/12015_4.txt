Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means, but he imagines what he could do with it! The land has great potential for suspense. John Garfield is just as excellent, and Raymond Massey is frightening against the guy. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive lady, but the support distribution is great and very capable. Yeah, he starts jumping early. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by being made little more than a love story. It's fun to look at Garfield, Massey and the character interpreters. But that's not great.
