I absolutely can not see what's fun in this movie. Humor seems to be destined for the corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. Characters do not give too much sympathy, some things that are not important. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers think of this scenario? "Let's make an old lady on the pot! Let's make them ... let them giggle! Let's make them ... behave like children!" Oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original! <br /> <This movie irritated me most of all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
