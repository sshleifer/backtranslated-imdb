Bridges in Madison County are a better version of this story. I felt that the end of this film was not treated sensitively, as they did in the original English film. This movie is very indian, if you are a very sensitive person who screams in a movie when the hero dies you will eventually like this movie, on the other hand if you are a fighter alive and I think crying is for wimps you can not as at the end. But overall is pretty good subject is well handled for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a wife and mother who cared. They all acted well.
