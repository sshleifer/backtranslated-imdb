Four years after he made directorial debut with "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what really wanted Hollywood to be one of the guys. "Roadie" is a brother-boy fraction, supplemented by battles in the bar, excited harps, Art Carney in a wheelchair ... and meat by the wheel. Meat Loaf (Travis W. Redfish's game!) It's actually a pretty charming presence on the screen and maybe in a smaller role (in a better movie) could be really stupid, but Zalman King's script is full of humor red stereotype and helpless Meat Loaf is kept in the eye and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie make all appearances - and all look embarrassed. Surely it should, "Roadie" is a bad journey. NO STARS from ****
