I have to say that although this film has been formulated all along, with a plot stolen from films like Friday / I know what you did last summer, this movie was not that bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most recently released Hollywood horror movies. Killing, though sometimes too imaginative, was in most cases only original. The distribution was mediocre, which is expected from low budget features, but much better than what the much larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio offers. My only real complaint, not due to the budget of the film, which must have been small, was the controversial "twist" that ended. I'm sorry, but that puts this movie in the bad category for me. The end was just bad and fixed. Before that, I was a little bit bored, but actually I'm glad. 4/10
