3lbs is obviously just a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to be a profitable moody producer / doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and unlike Gray's Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are not really interesting. This program should be set up in a leading center for neural cases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting that is going on! Not even the so-called pathetic "enmity" between him and a rival adds to the show and does not make those hallucinations. The pilot was a brief glance in the social life of the rulers as a father - the deferred! boring and useless. This show is pants, there are a bunch of medical dramas around at this time and this does nothing to make it stand out as special.
