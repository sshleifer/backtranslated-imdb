OK, the movie is good, but I give it 1 because the idea that a computer virus is becoming an organic virus is a pure fairy tale. This type of nonsense adds to those paranoid illusions of mad crazy behavior that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, rows of strings and tens of 1s and 0s are added to the computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even if it is much smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, the organic virus attaches a burrow into your cells and attaches itself to RNA, then changes its own RNA code. Explain how could such a thing be processed from a monitor? Perhaps radiation has an effect on the user's cornea that turns his eyes into these viruses? I saw that, but obviously the writer did not think about it.
