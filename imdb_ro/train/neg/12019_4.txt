I read a few good reviews in this forum for "Mr. Scarface," but for anyone not known in the genre of Italian gangster films like me, the picture will probably make little sense. Indeed, after the initial installment involving the Â£ 10 million scam, the picture becomes a rare film of revenge, with a minor twist in the character of Rick (Al Cliver). The entire plot of the war in the gang was swallowed for me by including Vincenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but, as most other viewers have commented, he is the only one who has made this picture alive with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unimaginable that those who watched Tony on the streets did not really do it until Tony got his hands on them. For all that he has accumulated as a title character, Jack Palance was quite worn out in a close anti-climactic end, making a US job, "Mr. Scarface," rather dissatisfied. I've seen enough Western spaghetti to know that not all work; I think in this case, my first view of a spaghetti gangster did not do well.
