It's incredible in that it manages to be terrible on so many levels. The script, the role, the direction and the choice of the film are terrible. Pseudo-medieval costumes, sets and pseudo-language are also extremely horrible. Strangely, I enjoyed this film once I accepted that there would be no good. It seems to be a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when they could really do something quite decent from the premise (though not very credible!) But instead we are treated in a rather cumbersome story of dragons and knights who has no charm found in other such fantastic movies. Let's hope the Lord of Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's clipping makes him look like He-Man. So!
