This is one of the worst movies I've ever met, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard proved to be unjustified. As far as the pure shooting technique is concerned, this director is competent. It was retained by the limited budget and VHS camera, but actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and stage staging are quite professional. I saw many movies in which "directing" was much worse. At least scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and has some clever images here and there. Also, forest scenes contain a decent atmosphere. There are just so many things you can do with a VHS camera and it does a nice job as far as the techniques do. As for artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera bends down so that we can see a urinate guy in the forest for 15 seconds, resembles the artistic style of the entire movie. This is pure garbage ... Total Gun. <br /> <br /> Gore is decent for a movie in this budget range. , is obviously false, but there are many of it, and it's very unusual. I've seen the American version with dubbing campy intentionally. This was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to do it through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's overwhelmed, especially by the end of the year. It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for the value of the camp. It is very hard to find a movie that is worse than it and puts it in a unique category.
