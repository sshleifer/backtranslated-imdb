I saw this in the theater when she left, and yesterday I saw her again by cable. I managed to recognize myself with the feeling of how outrageous this film is. The whole bunch of characters are self-absorbed narcissistic followers. Worse of all, it strengthens any negative stereotype about meeting with 20 people, even if it is meant to celebrate people "finding themselves". The good guys finish the last, the lost guys do a great job, the worst boys do the best. Girls are toy players. Only a character ("Wendy") is seen doing something useful to society on its own, and leaves with her virginity venerated for a long time in a nightmare with an expensive, in a film scene, about which we have to think romantically. What really is the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, terrified.
