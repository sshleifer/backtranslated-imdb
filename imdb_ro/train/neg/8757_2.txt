Apparently a movie that predicts future trends in British folk music is wrong on so many fronts that it's ridiculous. Tommy fast? Honeycomb beans? The film includes a song by Spencer Davis, two by Animals and one on the live movie of the Beatles, which makes the live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But, totally, a strange show of British music around 1964. Oh, and Hermit's Hermit.
