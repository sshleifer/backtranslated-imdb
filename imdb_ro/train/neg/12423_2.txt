Cage (1989) was another of those low-budget "action" movies that were produced in the 1980s, largely thanks to films such as 48 hours. and the lethal weapon. He calls Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as the old veterans in Vietnam who meet a local diving bar. Reb takes care of Lou for saving his life in Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and now it's pretty soft. Although it is enormous, Lou has a child's brain. One day, some burgers throw to wait in the bar, and Lou and Rebb knocked their mouths out of them. But the salary is a mother. They hit the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That's until these two elders enter the picture (one of them is a really nice guy) who have a plan in mind. Film is a waste of time. Perhaps if they went all the way and made a powerful move, instead of trying to alleviate the scare of the situation, it might have worked. Unfortunately, it is not and the public is left holding the bag. Good. It's too bad because you have all the elements for a great movie B. More luck next time, I think. It is not recommended. <br /> <br />
