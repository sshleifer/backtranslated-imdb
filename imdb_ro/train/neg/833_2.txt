It was not really a story in this movie. She relied freely on the events of the first Lion King movie. It is supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met by their loneliness. But there is not much more than that. Mix some scenes from the original, then ab-libs about how this movie has changed a bit. But still, is that it? We were hoping for something more. Instead, all I have to look for is an empty plot, with little explanation. I think if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion's universe then that's it. But besides, he has a little bit of justice for the entertainers. Disney should stop these direct-video productions. He was really boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D-"
