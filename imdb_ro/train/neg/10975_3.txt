This movie blows - let's head right now. There are some scene stones buried inside this pile of nonsense, but none can redeem the plot. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts in a similar fashion. Normally, I hate Colin because it's a fairy tale in general, but it's good in this movie. There were two lines of plot in this movie - one about a child throwing stones through vehicle windshields on the move, the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this movie has no strange idea what she wanted to say or where she wanted to go. Characters of character characters intertwine on some levels, but they are by no means worthy of being included in a script. The whole thing is feeble and useless and then there is an occasional scene. But on the whole - Do not worry if you do not like Irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and is saved by everyone, sounding like the lucky Lucky Charms - an American fetish who catapulted some really successful films to success.
