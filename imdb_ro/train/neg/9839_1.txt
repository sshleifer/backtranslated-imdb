The beginning of this movie was good. He started to become really stupid after he told people he wanted to commit suicide. I think if I came from a small town like me, I would have offended myself after seeing this movie. They made many of these people look disgusting and crazy. How could these people have so little to do that to follow it all day. Many times these people have told him that he has to commit suicide as he has urged him to do. How can so many people have a little respect for other people? I also think it could have been much better for this movie. There were also some good parts of this film. Some might like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
