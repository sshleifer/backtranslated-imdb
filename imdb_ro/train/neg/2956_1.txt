What did he think? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a future policeman who is teamed with a speaker dinosaur (!) for a murder case involving a madman who wants to start another age of ice. Straight-to-strip oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in self-seeking. It seems to have been a love job for director and director Jonathan Betuel (who also served as a producer); Unfortunately, the final results are anemic, to be charitable. Real Goldberg's presence on the screen can often cause a good will and a laugh, no matter how poor the scenario is, but here it chokes and you can see the unpleasant results. NO STARS from ****
