I'm a giant fan of horror / glitter, I really enjoy the horror movies that some people find stupid. I like the gorilla. The better, as long as it has a point. After reading the comments of others on the site, I was sure this movie would be a small stones. But much for my disappointment turned out to be one of the most useless films I've ever watched. The act was terrible, the dialogues were bad, the scenario was useless, the special effects were useless, and the editing was probably made by someone who died in the last two years. Usually, it seems to me that all these features make a great horror movie. But not in this case. We've weighed EUR 11 to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy unnecessary ghosts (eg violent sh sht movies) avoid at all costs!
