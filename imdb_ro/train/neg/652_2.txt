I think it was an overpriced PG-13 shit! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good, and others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other teenagers in the ball as well as leading friends were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and he looked so stupid. Death was bad, boring and completely non-original. The film was very boring and overrated. There was no suspense at all, I almost fall asleep. Another bad PG-13 remake, his true horror IMO movie. The end was so stupid, and the climax was very hurried and boring. The film is pretty slow. Overall, the only good thing about this carp fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW I think it gave good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but besides, it was a totally terrible movie and terrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave them 2/10.
