This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Again we made the mistake of buying the film because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looks pretty cool (After acquiring this movie and the film "Malevolence" that we analyzed here, I learned my lesson ). I like horror films taking place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This is supposed to happen in the Texas forests, but it was probably filmed in the director's yard. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the best. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.YE and another "mother and pop" store that bought DVDs and would not even buy it. How dreadful this was the feeble excuse for a movie. I've seen some bad movies before (for example, Troll 2), but it's definitely the cake. I did not think there was a movie worse than "Troll 2". The boy was wrong! Do not buy this movie if someone does not give you for free, but even if you stay with it if you do not throw it away, what are you about to do!
