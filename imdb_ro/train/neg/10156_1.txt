S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character pierced my tits. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie blows pretty much. The act is like an E list and it looks good in the movie. Not to mention that the budget is so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie seems to be shot with a video camera instead of decent film. The only reason I liked the movie was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Apart from the fact that if you see this movie at Blockbuster, everyone makes it hidden behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good must be mentally assessed.
