This movie was just down, really bad. I like war movies and can normally come out of most movies and find something I liked, but it was not one of them. This film was devoid of substance and intensity. OK, we did, the Finns did a fight, and that's great, but the story is not right. You have no real connection with any of the characters and there is no real line of stories to follow. You go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that tries to be transmitted. If you want a war movie that keeps you riveted and quite amazing without battle scenes, then I would suggest Downfall. Or, if you prefer an extraordinary line of stories and a lot of action, I would suggest the "Brotherhood of War" (Korean film war / Korean). These two movies will not disappoint you as the winter war.
