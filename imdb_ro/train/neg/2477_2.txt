If you want to know the real story of Wendigo, I suggest you take a copy of the original story Algernon Blackwell. This movie was not just bad, but it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I liked the book when I read it as a child (in Campfire Chillere by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on it coming out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that in the film there were too many PC subtleties (Correct Politics) that were not in the movie. When the book was written, the PC did not even exist. My suggestion is not to waste your time or money! If you see it on the shelf of the LEAVE IT THERE video store.
