This movie received just 1 because you can not give a zero! if you have a bad belly AT ALL do not look. human rights animals that you do not want to track. makes the vegetarian people swear I've seen it happen! the only interesting parts are the case and the fact that it's a true story. Really really super-frightening that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! do you feel safe when you put in that little code? I do not! He had access to every Kansas code !!!!!! I forgot the movie was not scary was the mental scare! Do yourself a favor and do not rent / buy this movie I think it costs about 20 dollars to make you INCLUDE their players OVER !!!!
