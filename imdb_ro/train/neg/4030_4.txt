I remember looking at the Missed Missile (in fact, throwing a match until my brother and several cousins ​​in whose house I was a guest overnight agreed to look at me - I was, from time to time , Eric Cartman of the 1960s - boys) and being somewhat embarrassed when a wave of millions of degrees of heat emerged as a plotting device - even as a secondary student, I knew that a single rocket simply could not transport the energy around the heat or devastation the duration and the limited range of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> My turkey process on loving relatives was a crime of self-punishment. The production film values ​​were very good. The act is not bad (except for the Shatnerism of the actor who played the role of the governor whom someone else mentioned). But the idea of ​​a light baking rocket of the Earth's surface through the heat of escape ... no. How did the people from "Mystery Science Theater 3000" die Miss Missile Missile, anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want to drink some beer at a weekend.
