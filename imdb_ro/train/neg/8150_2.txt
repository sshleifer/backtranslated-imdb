If you want an unimportant and fun hour, then it's good to look at it. It's not really that bad, really. Yes, it has more logic caducity than I like to describe here, and it could tax people's patience - like me, I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things on TV occasionally, but at least it's funny. Just because it's not always funny INTENTIONAL, there's no need to let you down. However, if you read the book - or any other book by Brookmyre - then you probably would be best avoided. I read them all and when I first watched this movie, I despised it. We destroyed it in detail and largely on another site, in fact. The TV field has virtually no relevance to the book and has served only to infuriate and furious many (and often rabid) believers, Brookmyre fans. Best advice ...? Watch this, then read the book and then make comparisons and judge.
