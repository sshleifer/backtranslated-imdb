Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean, ever. My wife and I were so bored out of our mind in 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it is totally unbelievable. Women (non-lesbians) do not bathe together - nor do they kiss "accidentally". The brothers and sisters did not live together at the age of 30 and batted around the swing dancing together and making passions in the central park. Men do not realize that their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never talked to her wife anymore. Absolutely ridiculous. Heather Graham is probably the worst actress in today's movies. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie he's ever been good about was Boogie Nights - and that's because he was not active. I can not stress how bad this movie was.
