Killer Tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor - you like or hate it. I like it personally, but in this fourth movie the feeling has disappeared. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are blades, even actors are not as funny. Because this is the only thing this movie should do - funny. So now, following the plot done to laugh, it's annoying. He should not have made the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
