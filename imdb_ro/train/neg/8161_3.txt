Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit is trying to get revenge on those who let her come to her fire doom back in 1957. Well, the movie takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the trap of the 80's strange / fake special effects, including a certain type of strange dementia climbing. In fact, Mary Lou's spirit is doing bad things to people and trying to take over a person's body. Whether it succeeds or not, you will have to watch to find out. In any case, the film is mostly boring and based on a bunch of worthless characters. Also, this is not really a continuation, the only thing in common with the first is the name of high school. It has the average value. horror escapes back, gore, unnecessary nudity, beats against the Catholic church. Basic elements, boring movie. The actor is decent enough to give him 3 out of 10. You can waste time doing something else.
