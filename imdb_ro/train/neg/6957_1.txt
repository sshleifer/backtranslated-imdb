Avoid this unless you want to watch an expensive but stupid movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film. This film tries to combine the Western epic, drug and antiquity. What the? Well, consider this. Cowboy music is hilarious during sword fighting. Or about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping down on the bed? Someone should do a "What's Up Tiger Lily" on this bomb. Rewrite the script and then double it or subtitle it. Heck, it's almost right now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American audience, have roles.)
