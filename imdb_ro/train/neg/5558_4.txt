I will not take too long here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is wonderful. I have all 3 on DVD, I added them to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks there with the best, such as Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, dead hard, get the point. There's not too much horror, thriller, set there. Many thanks to the entire crew, and we've set out to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you're wondering how I met her on DVD. I bought it via the internet, but it is the 4th region, as you know most of the US players are region 1. If you own a Playstation 2 Sony, you have the best DVD player because it's a player across the region. Just go to configure, then choose the witch region you want you want (1-9).
