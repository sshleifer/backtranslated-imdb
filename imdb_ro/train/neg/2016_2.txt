***** Warning: May contain huge SPOILER ********* My problem with this film is how it is selfish and self-consumed adulteress wife! After having a nightcloud with a noisy psychiatrist, he is being watched by him. He calls it constantly and threatens her, and even sends a video of the night together. He is crazy and very dangerous OBJECT. The problem is she just thinks it's dangerous for Her (and exposes her secret). Not for a second she ever had a thought of concern for her husband! Even for a moment he thought about it, being likely to be in danger from this psychotic? As soon as he realized how crazy was supposed to warn her husband, regardless of the consequences. It may not be a movie then, but really was not one anyway, so what's the difference.
