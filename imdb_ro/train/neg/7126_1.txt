I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and where I can not really believe it. I laugh so much about what must have been the most serious writing and acting in the history of mankind, I was seriously worried that we might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater. the scene we were talking about, the "hero" just saw his brother's accident and his brother's car exploded just a few meters away from him (the hero). The "hero" throws "fits" expected to see something so tragic and people were trying to keep him back from running in the burning car. In the middle in which he fits and his uncontrollable / emotional crack breaks he says "I am so sad" - he said that's right? I'm crazy?
