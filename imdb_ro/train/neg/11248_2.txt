A gave it "2" instead of "1" (terrible), because there is no denying that many of the visuals were amazing, a lot of talent came into special effects and artwork. But that was not enough to save her. "Sepia" toned, washed in color a kind of work was done before many times in other movies. Nothing new there. I can see that there are some tips for other old, classic movies. O.K. No problem with that. But a movie must be fun and exciting, not something that will make you sleep. The story line and the script of this film It was terrible, the two-dimensional characters. Slow motion. Some scenes were pretty amazing, but eventually overall it was pretty boring, I could not recommend it.
