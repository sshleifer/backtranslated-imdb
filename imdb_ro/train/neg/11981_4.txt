Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice which she thinks is poisonous and she goes out of business. Dresler is good. Never tea my tea, but it's a solid performance that definitely keeps the screen. I saw this for Polly Moran, which I saw elsewhere. Here, Moran is ok - ok - like the friend / foe Dressler. Too bad he fell into almost total oblivion. The land has a good heart. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and ends well. I wonder about the central mechanism of the plot: bonds. This occurred during the Depression, so maybe everyone was familiar with the links and what they can do if they are used well and if they are misused. I, however, not from that time, are vaguely familiar with them. They're different stocks, right? It seems strange to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
