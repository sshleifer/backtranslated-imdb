I can not believe how inappropriate this movie is. It's like seeing the police academy, except that it's people who have no clue what they were talking about and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that should be a pity. I understand the suspension of mistrust, but that's just stupid. Not only is there no plot for this movie. It's like pursuing someone who claims to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words as if he were a head of staff in a major medical institution. In addition, people wear clothes that are not suitable for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a movie in Valley-faces "b" in space.
