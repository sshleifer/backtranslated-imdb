Not that I want to be bad, but this movie surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie, we were like ... erm ... what is this movie about? I do not get the animations at all. Perhaps this film will only be suitable for those in the 1980s. During the movie, there is a group of people who came out. After the film, many people said, "Is that what?" Frankly speaking, I can not believe that this film has been awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you're thinking about watching this movie, I recommend you do not worry. You'll regret. I'm not kidding. You will find yourself losing as much money as you go and watch them.
