* May contain spoilers * I leaned back to be fair to this movie. I knew she played Madonna. I knew it lasted a week in theaters. I knew he had a lot of bad reviews. I did not expect a profound and profound examination of the class, culture and sexuality, as in the original Italian. The benefit of doubt lasted for ten minutes. Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, hearty gorgon who goes on holiday with her husband and flippard friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, presenting some really bad facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first teammate of the ship, whom the Madonna character enjoys humiliating and treating as dirt in every scene they have together. Why is he so strong for him? Simply because the plot calls for it so that later, when the two of them will lie down on a deserted Mediterranean island, the tables will be turned and he will learn a lesson. Equally inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and abusing each other for two-thirds of the film. "Swept Away" is a bad, simplistic, superficial film from the beginning. Madonna offers a typical wooden performance. There are many great scenes: Madonna sings and dances atrocious at Giannini's request, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where she hits her and hits her ass. Guy Ritchie makes "elegant" editing, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the most serious dialogues that I've heard in a major movie in a few years. The end is septic and implausible. In principle, Blue Lagoon meets "Overboard" minus the nudity of the first and its sense of humor. Perhaps the Madonna's ego is so great that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress. Give it, Madge, for our sake and yours. This is not her worst movie. This distinction also belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". He did nothing worse than ... yet.
