I remember vaguely Ben of my fantastic Sci-Fi days of the 1960s, I made some interviews and bios of obscure actors / actresses, especially Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961, The Young Savages . Ben was one of the Sci-Fi scientists in Chicago, around 1970, when I had a pleasant conversation with him and his "career" and his life. All of this has been published in some fanzines of the long forgotten day. I still want to be copies of those interviews, but time marks and any of those people would certainly not remember me so many years later. Ben was a very nice man to give up his life (Those of those days did not even pay their guests, unless of course they were great stars, and even then the salary was at least two hundred dollars! Good to know that Ben is still alive and hit! As for the remake of the creature, but 50 years older, ugly then, more ugly now!
