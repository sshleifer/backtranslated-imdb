I read somewhere where it should have been a remake of the 1949 noir movie, "Criss Cross". We found that the latter is disappointing, but it was better than this movie. This movie is a "neo-noir" because it is modern and colorful, two things that purists would make it disqualified for film noir. <br /> <br /> The biggest negative for this, however, was not the cinema (which was fine), but the story muddled. Hey, some of Dashiell Hammett's stories in the 1940s were similar, but I did not even care about some of them. Movie makers here did not help by putting flashbacks into the story that seemed every three minutes. No wonder it was to keep up with this story. It was ridiculous! What is happening is that, up to 45 minutes, there is so much confusion that no one cares. I know I did not.
