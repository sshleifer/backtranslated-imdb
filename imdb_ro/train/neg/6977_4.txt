I read all the reviews here and impressed the imagination of those who loved this movie. I can not say I found too many to recommend it. The Leonard Cohen soundtrack is not just overly difficult but also beyond measure. The film seems pretty authentic, but something has to happen to make it work and nothing happens: a soft plot (it's not a real problem for me), not a lot of character development, nothing thematic. Simply slogs. As it is, Cimino "The Heaven's Gate" has moments of genuine wonder and it's a movie that I would look back on earlier. For a brilliant Western reconciliation, HBO's "Deadwood" is far superior to "McCabe."
