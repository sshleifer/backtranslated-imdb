Strangely, Rene Russo's eyes and mouth - not Buddy the Gorilla - appear as Buddy's focal point, a production by Jim Henson Pictures through Zoetrope to Francis Ford Coppola. In a way, the countless scenes on Russo's face slipped into the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times that the poor monkeys are high. The unintentional amusement magazine, adapted by Gertrude "Trudy," Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor who turns his mansion into a pet housekeeping and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it sneaks with honest sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of "family magic" it needed, and long before both humans and animals seem to be programmed distinctly (nothing feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees go to Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (Alan Cumming's head is missing with centimeters); however, no eyebrow is raised because it is always in one day's fun. Still, when Buddy's guerrilla gorilla becomes crazy during a storm, it's called the cops - and everyone looks at Buddy through the window as he busts the furniture in the living room. Furniture should be the least of someone's worries in this storm, a better failure. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: Whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives Rene a very close start. I wonder what the lipstick budget means on this image? ** from ****
