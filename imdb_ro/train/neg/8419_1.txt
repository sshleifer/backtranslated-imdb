I have been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a long period of time ... which is still raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I have to say that the first quarter of the movie was good! It really represented the scene of black music ever since. However, as the movie was being worn, I and my whole family were bored with our intelligence. The weighing continues to come, one after the other. I mean seriously, just a lot of more music and would have broken even with RENT. Moreover, I have noticed a personal development in any of the characters; I did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I did not feel any excitement for that character. Characters had a slim background about childhood singing and what not, but personalities were not discovered enough to attract me. Ultimately, the conflict was simply not meaningful enough to care for the viewer, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall, I think this movie would best fit a person who does not care about an overall story, yet enjoys two hours of entertainment and fun shows.
