I and a group of friends rent them horrible videos to laugh at them, believe me it has led to some horrible money spent, but also to some big laughs. SICK. is one of the best horror-but-funny movies I've hired. The plot is overtaken, the whole of your friends in the woods and never returns things are very old. The worst part of the film looks as though you were visiting the local butcher, except for a little dirty and blood on the dough that shows the meat. And if someone ever was scared of this movie, at any time they should stay at Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the film are that the two faces in it are quite hot, one better than the other and you see both naked during the movie. The other good thing is that this movie is so bad sometimes that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to watch the horrible actors or to rent these terrible videos, I do not think about the fun, but I have seen the effort that these people put in it and it's still going out so hilarious and worth it . laugh at the descent of someone I would recommend. If you rented it or you bought it to laugh at it, I would give it a price of 8.5.
