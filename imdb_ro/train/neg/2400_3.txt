No, it was not one of the ten most bad films of the '80s, but it certainly shook the 100th floor somewhere. This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain the special pre-dating effects of "An American Werewolf in London", the disco was still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan was not the 40th President of the United States? While we're at her, let's not forget those hairdos from the 1950s and 1960s. I've seen more from here than in "Happy Days" & "Laverne & Shirley" combined. The only woman who raises this movie to "so bad, good is" was the delay, great Elizabeth Hartman, but barely. Biff plays in the role of Miss Montgomery, a school-school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that has been killed and still tormented by Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" she retains her mouse qualities. Her call for help is proof of this. And she looks much better than Miss Wimp. - Seven dollars at the beauty salon, shot in hell. He was not kidding. That does not mean there are no good parts elsewhere, there are only a few and I'm far away, and I'm not saying just because I like Hartman. Actually, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and that was not that good
