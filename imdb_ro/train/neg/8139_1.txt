Or maybe that feels. Anyway, "The Bat People" is as flat as a carpet, gentle as a bag of flour and as interesting as a stone ... and as intelligent as all three combined. (Moss) is bitten by a bat as he checks a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and then turns into a bat - no, just a bat, but a bat - like a creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a person's first person's point of view. But then there's the sheriff's (Pataki) business, which is about sheriff: the type of hick. He tempts people, he sleeps at married women, steals handkerchiefs from haberdashery, smokes with one of those cigarettes in his mouth and talks at the same time, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit "and (this is the worst part) ... IS THE BEST CALIBRATION IN THE MOST FILM! The whole movie, however, is just the TV-of-the-week movie-like the crap (guano, in this case). It's AIP, because it cries out loud! What would you expect, Oscar-like stuff? And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? How about ... no stars for The Bat People, full version or MST3K version! By the way, if there's ever a sequel to this movie, I'm burying my TV.
