So, start with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who are asked to come to this house and (it's not surprising) that caregivers always block gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke, etc. This doctor tells them a scary story about this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh, no, a ghost of a girl. Some people talk more, then this huge ghost comes and so on. This girl finds out that this ghost has killed young children and that she has to release her souls, yes, blah blah. It does, but oh, no, she dies like her. And it goes to heaven as this evil spirit goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. Scripture is terrible because a guy pulls his head off and Elanor (who dies saving children) says "oh no." The act is wooden, the effects are silly, and the set is a couple of cameras used over and over again. Basically, if you like laughing at the wrong movies, watch it, but if you're looking for hope, then surely give this movie a wish. I was extremely disappointed when I looked at this. A very disappointed. My sister (who becomes very sacred) is bored in this movie is awful.
