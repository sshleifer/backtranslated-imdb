Another bad, the smallest one can go here is one. Otherwise, this would have an easy zero. Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, Peckenpah's name was not on a thing I'd never guessed he did. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco knows he was very much on stage, and from near sunup says Sam was just slipped. It's on the way. The laughter at the beginning of the film is the only thing in the whole misery that deserves a second look. Even Gig Young can not be watched. This is a real masochism test. If I had been forced into a theater to see that I was screaming. And now I really feel guilty about looking at everything from the limits of a very comfortable sofa that was too nice to leave. What misery seemed less written than compound while they were going. It's not just a bomb but a bmob spelled back. Hopa !!!!!
