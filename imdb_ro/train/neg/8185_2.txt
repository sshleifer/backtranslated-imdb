Oh my. I decided to go to the cinemas with some friends, eager to watch one of those light Christmas films, and I went away disgusted. The movie failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, played his character and played horribly, alongside Vince Vaughn, who has always been a favorite of my own. They are trying to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. Kind of bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be very wrong. The first ten minutes were not bad, but once I saw Santa, it's over. It was not better, the rate remained the same, there was no character development, and it is certainly one of the most serious Christmas films ever invented. You do not look at him, no matter what you do.
