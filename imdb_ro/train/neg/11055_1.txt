I just watched this movie in high definition on TV. I'm in a wheelchair because of a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch some movies made about people with physical disabilities. At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about people with disabilities and the length of time he spent in recognizing people with disabilities and integrating them into the mainstream labor market is great. And my problem is not the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the message he preaches, that we found him insulting. First of all, they did not throw anyone into a title role with real physical disability. Of course they were competent actors, but it seems completely dishonorable to preach about hiring disabled people and then not to rent OFF for nothing in the movie. In addition, in the fact that in a scene in the middle of the movie one can see a man walking on a podium on crutches, which seems to have only one leg. But CGI in this scene is so obvious that it is shameful. What the? Can not find a real amputee for nowhere for the movie? For a 5 second chance, was it more financially sound to get CGI effects than to feel an ACTIVE amputee? At that moment in the movie, I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message she was trying to convey that I came here to marry and complain about him as a pathetic critic.
