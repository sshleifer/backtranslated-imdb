Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor. Director "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer a long image of Huppert's face, and these are a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - she records the emotion with the smallest eyebrows or flicker of smile. Aside from the joy of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you enjoy self-mutilation, sado-masochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" might work for you. In addition to these attributes, we could not find any ransom value in it. ) <br /> <br /> Born in all this strange material there is a pile of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musical, athletic, indifferent - start from strange people and turn into strangers from the competitive environment. It does not deserve a trip to a cinema to revive this lesson of life. <br /> <br />
