Writer / director Peter Greenaway cherishes the title of High Lord of the Pretensional Art House with his last exercise in indulgence of self-indulgence, 8 ½ women. The film follows a rich Englishman and his son in a mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, while luring and blackmailing women (guess how many) to join a personal collection of concubines. Think of any possibility that this premise could be offensive, and the chances are Greenaway. The female characters are a bit more than a catalog of fetishes for the two protagonists to participate. There is Mio obsessed with Kabuki, Giaconda and Beryl, ever pregnant, who has something for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, it's "the half woman," you understand? Greenaway vehemently denies all the misogyn accusations, but if it is not, then what is it? The film continues to erase anything and everything that has to do with Japan, a continuation of the themes in the blood - the worthy (but less sexual) film 1996, The Pillow Book. But if the Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ women become horny and exploiting. Greenaway's activity is devoid of taste and arrogance in its fetishism, and the only person who can enjoy watching it is the author himself.
