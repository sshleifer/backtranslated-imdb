That this feeble excuse for an amateur watch was announced at Sundance is an extraordinary example of what is wrong with most indie creators these days. First of all, there is something like the art of cinema. Just lifting a 16mm camera and pointing it to someone who has a line does not make for a real movie. I think we have to be lucky that the director did not take someone's room ... Second, indie films should be real people. There is nothing real about this movie. None of the characters ever meet as human. <br /> <br /> What they encounter as a being of a writer's imagination trying to impress his buddies by showing him how cool and nervous he is. <br /> <br /> We are sorry, but this is not a good writing or a good direction. What's left is a mirror of an evil film that somehow made the way to Sundance. It's hard to believe this was one of the best movies I've ever seen ... In any case, it has made me lose what's left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
