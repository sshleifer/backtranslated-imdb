This movie was probably inspired by the male Godard, the feminine and I urge you to see the film in return. The film has two strong elements and these are (1) the realistic act (2) the impressive, well-deserved, photo. Besides, what strikes me most is the infinite flow of humility. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. It acts so badly and with all the nudity in this movie ... it's unattractive. By comparing Godard's film, the intelligentsia was replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that it results from the difference of ideals between the French and Swedish societies. A film of time and place. 2/10.
