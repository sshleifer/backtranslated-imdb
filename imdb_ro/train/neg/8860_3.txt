OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is due to the fact that it was a heavy sexploitation film that had a lot of excised material (or dark up close to invisibility) to escape the Censor X's evaluation; but the film also has other flaws. First of all, the screenwriter seems to have wandered werewolves and vampires. The bad guys in this film are mild and do not like silver, but in any other way they behave like vampires. Now, you can not do this with a genius movie, you have to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans are confused and upset by suspending the unbelief in what is wrong. In fact, the whole plot (confused and poorly presented) is something that has already been done for vampires, but it does not make sense in the movie. Second, the werewolf suits are the most ugly they've ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf business should know that the werewolves' costumes and transformations are some things that critically evaluate the fans, yet some of these werewolves are simply goofy. There are a few good bits. I really liked the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Danning tits. And ... (*** SPOILER ***, if there is such a thing) I also liked the plan to attack the Werewolves Fortress. There are so many horror films based on stupid characters, but in this case I get a very sensitive and efficient anti-werewolf arsenal first and go to butcher monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. It should not be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in the usual style, this film goes over the top and adds some other fun and funny anti-lycantrope weapons.
