I would not say that completely sucking, but if it was not for Netflix, I would not even have this in my house. Steve Martin, the eccentric president of a chain of health food stores, is collapsing. It's not really funny. He is the other in a long-dead murder SNL who can only find working whoring them in the next SNL movie. The birth coach with Elmer Fudd lisp is as fun as the original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same moves she would do for a 7-minute SNL on skit, which is as fun as SNL lately. The only thing that goes for this movie is that Tina Fey is light on her eyes. The end was predictable as soon as you heard that her character could not get pregnant. The subject could have been open to other comedy attempts, but it seems to feel light, over time, without having fun or really creating laughs.
