This film story is pretty bad, which can happen in real life. I can not really understand when this bad movie shows us. I say it was bad because there is a reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do everything he wants then why do you fall in love with that bad man. 2. How can the story script be so weak? She was so rich, she can do whatever she wants, but she does not dare divorce her husband, it's very impossible. The words I love you do not mean anything in this movie.
