This film barely followed the story line of the film. All the fascinating points of the book did not even exist in the movie. They have come to turn it into a crude story "tween" Disney movie "crush" between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff should have played the role or one of them. This film was just an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney could even escape with such cheap, basic teaching. If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree that it could easily be transformed into a movie of "Lord of the Rings". This film should never have used the title "A Wrinkle in Time". Very well done.
