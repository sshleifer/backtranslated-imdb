The directors cut the version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours are too long. If you can choose, definitely go for non-executives cut. The main plot is almost not taken at all, the film consists of the main part of several crime scenes that are connected, but the feeling is that they are just presented to fill the film with cruel violence. The link is not revealed until the last part and the lack of context bother me long before being there. As a horror film, it does not work. You never get the desired sense for the characters because of the mediocre action and the general mood (the character is presented, after 15 minutes the character is dead). This image with powerful images is in the spray side.
