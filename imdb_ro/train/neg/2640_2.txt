Trying to conceive something insipid like SENTINEL would be quite difficult. There are many problems. The result is terrible and is loaded with plot holes. Michael Douglas plays the role of Pete Garrison, an agent of the Secret Service, who "took one" to Reagan during the trial of his life. A few years later, we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, mainly as the first lady's guard (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise because we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and a sudden threat against the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraphic test, he was chosen as a dissatisfied agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). As the crying of the presidential assassination is composed, Pete is fleeing from his own people. Her only confession is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for each other (which is why Pete first missed the polygraph). But is Pete really innocent? Or are they just trying to buy time until they can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> The big, overwhelming issue with this movie is that there is no justification for the underlying cause of the presidential threat. Is not that the movie? He would think so! But the audience is never letting the assassin (s) want to kill Prez. Hmm. Does anyone forget to put this in the script somewhere? And what about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? It looks like she was put in the movie strictly like a piece of doll candy. What was her purpose again? Did anything else but look good in tight pants and a tiny blouse? There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel to be ridiculous. Action is too easily compromised by "What ...?" answers that will be uttered by those unhappy to watch the movie.
