(Bouncer included, some would say) This movie is not possible to take seriously. Some parts are so terrible that I can not laugh at everything. Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with climbing tools or (and this is really my favorite), shooting a bad guy by sticking it on a stalactite. Yes, what power did he do to do such things? I do not know, but he really does a cash run.
