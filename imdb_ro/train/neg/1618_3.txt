I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations. I have seen Jacquet's previous film (the penguins march) and I heard a very positive audition on this radio station. However, I was very disappointed. Most of all, this movie is extremely boring. Nothing literally happens. I tried to describe the content of a friend's movie and we both laughed because we could only stomach things like "well, then it comes winter and then spring, and then there is an eagle and a river and once it's dark and the girl goes in a cave, and once again the fox has children "and so on. About half an hour later, I began to sigh, flinch, twist, curse the reviewer at the radio station and hoping it would end soon. But the movie continued and continued. When it was finally over, I sank so deeply in my chair that I probably looked a little like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the film are (a) The girl, who is obviously there to give the children with someone to identify themselves. He wears the same clothes throughout the film (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness. She's cute, no doubt about it. However, a movie about the beauty of nature, like this one, would have done better without her too human presence. I always woke up hoping that she could be eaten by a bear drowned in the river or something terribly similar. (b) The adult voice of the girl, which tells us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring and redundant things. (c) music, which has a desperate despair. When the little girl plays happily, the music jumps around. When the fox is threatened by an eagle, music is also threatening. He remembered my first days of filming and it was too predictable to be glad. Of course, many of the children who have seen the movie with me are obviously enjoyable, at least somehow involved. So, my warning only applies to adults: if you are over 10, avoid this movie. You can get a better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places.
