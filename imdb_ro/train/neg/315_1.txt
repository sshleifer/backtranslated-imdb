Watching this stinker is a cruel and useless punishment from Sandler. Really a slow and painful death. He bought the DVD in the $ 5.88 basket from Wal Mart. But the thought that continues to remind my head is "How can I bring my money back?" The most unforgivable thing about the film is that the boat is not jumping! <br /> <b> The best constructive suggestion: Mystery Comedy Theater. You know the show on the SciFi channel, where a guy and his bait cars spy out the most undesirable horror films (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY, filters a comedy program and presents this movement. Without a good humor of this train wreck, I'm afraid the audience might actually start to follow Sandler with ice and chain saws. <br /> <br />
