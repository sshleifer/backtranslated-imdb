First of all, I liked the novel Ray Bradbury. It's the sort of horror that gets under your skin and sticks to you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope this movie is okay. He had a lot of chances with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And even Bradbury even wrote the script. And beyond all of this, it has WAY GRIER! How could it fail? <br /> <br /> Spoilers may appear. <br /> <br /> First of all, he was crushed. Much of the horror of the book was lost because Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the pictures in the book ... gone. Everything that made you mess up ... was gone. And then it's the act. Like many movies that Disney threw in the 80's, the kids in this movie can not act. And that bothered me a lot, none showed 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not approached. It was more of a knowledge. <br /> <br /> You think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could play Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark in their roles. But here it is as if they do not care. All they want to do is pay some mortgages or something like that. This is far from being some of the best performing. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was good as a witch, but the witch's spokesman was not well retired. It's much worse and does not have the presence as it did in his book. <br /> <br /> And all that was left out of the book. Ballon's nightwear, Jim's house marking, Mr Dark's real death, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry road, the fate of the light bar dealer, the real witch's death, and oh much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the '80s. The cheerful reward of the lady for one thing, with the horses overlapping around them, was not really creepy, and that strange green fog that had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could still think about how this movie destroyed the original novel, but it boils the blood. You do not see this movie, but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.
