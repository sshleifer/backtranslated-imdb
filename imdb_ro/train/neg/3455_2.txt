Lord! This is one of the movies you think you've seen before, but you did not. I mean, you did not fool about it, but somehow it came to mind. To be honest and short; this is one of the worst, boring and stupid things ever done. I can not say anything good about this piece of nonsense, because there are only decent sequences to tell her that they are made by professional filmmakers. The scene of death is horrible, bloodless, stupid. The pleasure is somewhat good given that he has copied "Popcorn" since 1991. To make matters worse, this film is not so bad that it's good. It's simply bad. Molly Ringwald tried to do her best, but it was not enough.
