Because I am not a fan of blood and courage, I found spelling scenes that are absolutely useless (spell it) and too real to please, if you are the type of person who takes their rocks off on the internet or on movies tell them that, ask the faith what kind of person dreams of this sick illness, though. Besides, it had the potential to be a great movie, music was also the top class (through the film and especially the final credits). Some parts were unbelievable, as you just found your friend, entrusting her in anticipation of torture and death, and all you do is tell him what happened and how you got there (why not asked her if she happened to have some napkins or even some air bags or a piece of gum while she was at her?), come on now, most likely it would just be shouting "hurry up and untie , then leave it FAST! ". if they were bait, worms, etc., and when the girl accidentally went over the place certainly the rotten flesh smell would sound a few alarm bells! I would recommend this film to Dennis Niellson's friends and so, I'm sure such a movie would make such a sick person happy Christmas.
