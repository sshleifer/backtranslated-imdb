This movie was sucked. The act was aspirate, the script was sucked, and the movie was sucked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the spectator had to do a job to figure out what's going on. I'm not saying it needs to be clarified, but suddenly you find things that happen and are said to have the slightest hint of what I am. Examples: Heroic negative comments about the hero. The audience never shows how he knows anything about the guy and how he is linked to the death of his fianc√©. The visitor has a minimal exposure to the death of the guy. Also, suddenly there is a scene with a bunch of boys who load and throw machine guns and that's all you see before cutting into the other scenes. No explanation about the weapons and the people with them. We gave it 3, because we did not feel that we wanted our time back. It was fun to film the movie while you watch it, so at least it gave us some entertainment. ;-)
