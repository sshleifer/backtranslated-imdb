This movie is a massive Yawn proving that the Americans did not hang out of the farce. Even when it was already written for them! The original "Hodet Over Vannet" is an error-filled comedy that I would pay 8/10. It is not just a linguistic translation, but also some absurd chains of events that have been completely murdered, robbing the film of its original, intelligent phantom nature and turning it into a cheap oops going my pants style.
