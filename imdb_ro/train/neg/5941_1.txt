As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I was looking forward to this movie. I regret to see that it's a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to illustrate Notorious B.I.G. A lot of stories follow the real son of Notorious B.IG, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. like a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay homage to his father. Derek Luke is as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, nobody is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is the real ones they play. It was boring and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans alike do not already know. I was particularly disappointed by Angela Bassett, a very good actress scattered here like Voletta Wallace. Films and film films believed that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend money on it. I'm sorry to say that happened. There is nowhere near a good movie. I was expecting so much, but unfortunately I did not get anything out of it. I think you should definitely jump her.
