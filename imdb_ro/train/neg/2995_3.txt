Only on a very rare occasion an episode of x files fails to generate emotions or the episode contains everything that is simply boring to watch. A detective and his former partner die in unexplained circumstances. The deaths are related to the presence of a girl who was there when the death occurred. Mulder invented a theory that a cop murdered by his colleagues turned back reincarnated as a little girl and is a demanding vengeance. Now for the bizarre bit. no connection to everything, and seems to be just a random person chosen as reincarnation. I think this was slightly written lazy by the writers and this episode is one of the worst in the history of x files!
