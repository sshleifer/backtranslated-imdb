Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time shows the black side. Put your last dollar to make an unfortunate ending! But why? With just half a dozen exceptions, ALL homosexual films have to end with death or with another "end". It's like all the European Noir films in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. The conductor ... man or woman has to die or go alone in oblivion. Why, in the name of God, must writers, directors and producers have the public to let the theater feel depressed? After all, it should be gay ... not pitiful. Perhaps the category should be changed into a joke. A great deal of homosexual relationships last and couples go together in the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the inferior part of homosexual life and gives the wrong impression of gay lifestyle. This film proves only my point of view. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, because there is another "homosexual" movie! It is wrong!
