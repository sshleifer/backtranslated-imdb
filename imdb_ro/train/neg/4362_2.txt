A group of human aliens who go to earth to eat rough ground on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead of eating all fizdeelic mushrooms and acting retarded. Fuzzy with images of the "Planet of the Dinosaurs" and terrible jokes, this is certainly a desirable one. The actress is atrocious, too, and while this is not as bad as "Chickboxer" (what movie can be?) This is still quite terrible things repugnant. Runtime of 90 minutes feels like an eternity and you will probably curse life, do a huge favor and just thanks, skip this bad movie, there's nothing to see here. Movie producers try to resell this turret as an MST3K style, making you fun with the movie they made a decade ago and it works as small as possible, but Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive voice. /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extract: Joke Comment, 17 Behind featuret scenes; 7 minutes In a black element; Jessica Mills Reporting; Image Gallery and original trailer
