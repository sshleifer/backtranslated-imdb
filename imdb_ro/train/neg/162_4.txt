a movie that tries to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the film twists and turns through the mirida plot "surprises" to a desperate attempt to keep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing "plot" with hot scenes believing it would help along. James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt, and only sleep is going through the movie. the same applies to the other "actors". the plot is pretty bad and sticky. in which there is no such crime, but at the end, the huge overthrow of the plot becomes very tedious and boring. However, the film succeeds in generating interest in the middle. In all that's worth a lazy clock on a really boring day, but do not worry if you miss it.
