This show is terrible, jokes are terrible and getting worse. I'm one of those people who has never been a big fan of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at first until she went into a routine around the second season, all the jokes were played and the characters had nothing for They. Well, at least Gas Corner was good at the beginning, Little Mosque on the Prairie is usually the terrible CBC comedy that had nothing to take from Episode 1. Who are the people watching this show anyway, I'm honest is the fact that the elderly people or maybe only people who actually live in the prairie? Maybe the jokes are for them and work there? I do not know a single person to show this show and can not stand alone, jokes are completely predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. I hope it will not last much longer because all the successes of this show seem to me to rely entirely on the premise of this show being a Muslim that is different and could / should have led to a great show .
