The Wicker Man. I'm so upset that I can not write a correct comment about this movie. The land was ridiculous, tied, and it was just blades. Nicolas Cage ... ashamed of you! We assumed that when you were in it, it would be at least decent. I did not feel it. I felt like huge parts of the film were left on the floor of the cutting room, and even if it is complete - the film was just extravagant and silly. <br /> <br /> <> At the end, you are letting the agape mouth, the mind surrounded and the good offended taste. I have never heard that so many people leave a theater on the opening day with so much hate. People complained about this in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's so bad. I heard it in comparison with: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My friend was so upset he did not even talk about it. Grrrr!
