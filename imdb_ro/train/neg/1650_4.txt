Four of the best friends, young chauvinist chickens (with a focus on pigs) meet weekly at a NYC dinner to tell their sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator that dates to the three bachelors in the group, leading to conflicts and inevitable "whipping." Although the premise of the movie has potential and there are some fun moments to have in general the film does not particularly work in the end when the girls are made to not appear better than the boys who contravene the principle of history. One of those one-person bands with a dozen producers, "Whipped" is likely to enjoy just the kind of young men who think "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
