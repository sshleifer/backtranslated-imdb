you do not see that. this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. difficult to be a Mormon, sometimes when there are movies like this. what a sad thought about the life of Mormon. I can tell you if you've seen this movie that it's not all like this in a single section. if I do not think I'd succeeded in doing it. too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the act was so bad that my wife and I just managed to do it. I think you could say he has all the signs of a B. movie or there are C movies? anyway ... I thought this movie was sucked in and was full of cheese. I want some Mormons to start making some quality movies.
