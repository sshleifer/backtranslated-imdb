this is the perfect example of a great thing that happens horribly bad ... so can I advise someone to look at it? well, I was pretty compelled to have been in the Tiff contest (still can not believe it won) ..and I only stayed until the end because the director was there for a q & a section .. but that it was also something else than interesting .. what is it about? well, the first half (the one that is worth watching) presents three characters: a prostitute, a musician and a kind of official ... the first two lies about their professions ... but the third is the real liar .. the second half something else .. do not destroy a good evening) includes old breasts and heavy drinks .. but maybe you will see it completely different ... the jury tiff did (if they drink vodka?)
