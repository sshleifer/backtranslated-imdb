Maya is a woman without interests. She dreams of her life and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting subject. That would need a good story, a beautiful framework and good dialogues. It does not have any of these. This movie is completely boring. There are only lengths and not climaxes. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. But, although I'm a big fan of him, I could not stand this movie. Even he can not give up on this movie. The movie is not as bad as the "King Uncle" and if you are a fan of the Art-house or you like to be slow, you might be pleased. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not gripping. My recommendation: Do not look at her.
