... Well, this pop in the DVD, loses an hour and a half of your life that you will never come back and find out. Actor? What action? <br /> <br /> Production values? ... Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> Story? It does not make me start. After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I'd see such a bad movie that I really wanted a lower rating than one. Have we always found at least one reason or two to see the merit - if only in the intent or effort of the writer, the director, the distributor or the producer? In this case, they are the same guy (!) Who really needs to handle the fact that, at least as this unnecessary loss of video tape demonstrates, he has no talent. I mean, it would be a reasonable excuse if it were a "production" for the first class of the cinema, but the "artist" behind this game was twenty-six at the time of this spontaneous miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How has this ever been done? Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for it? Moreover, do not let the crash of the box fool you: it does not even look like a good sex scene or a good "exposure" of the piece on this cover. Two final things: one second when this "movie" had a redeeming value: the "talent" mentioned above is left rounded by his lover. I cheered! And, I learned something from this "movie". There are moments when something is so bad that it really is really very funny. But not in a comic manner; it's just sad humor. Very sad humorous.
