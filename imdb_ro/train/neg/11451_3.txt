Okay, friends, a serious movie guy is expected to watch all sorts of movies, both bad and good, and this movie put me to the test. I will not praise the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The act was bad. Always the wonderful Sissy Spacek has done nothing to make this movie better. I really wondered why I was really bothered to see this movie spoiled? Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspected was bad? The answer is, of course, that I am an old film and therefore can not avoid what should otherwise be avoided. I will not waste time explaining what was wrong with this amateur film, except to say that the quality of the act was, to say politely, subpaar. A serious movie boss may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay at home, do not waste time, read a book, take care of yourself or have a good sandwich.
