Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedy. However, I feel it was sold to earn my first leading role in the budget. Foxx follows Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have seen their talents scattered by stereotypical producers who think that black men who commit serious crimes are a fun concept (see: Blue Streak talks) . Well, I laughed a few times and I gave all these comedians to continue to take hilarious roles, but I'd love to see these boys burn their portrait to Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a dream. Or in the colors of life Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans are moving into the satirical performances of Spike Lee Bamboozled.
