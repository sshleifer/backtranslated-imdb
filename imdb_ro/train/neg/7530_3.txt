I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting, with a rushing end "gorgeous" that did not call the global story. Watching these characters through a dreadful weekend of terrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news is not my obvious and exciting film idea, and I'm tired of the "one-note" theme and I could not wait to end - I stopped halfway down the road. The whole movie seemed useless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, although the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small attractions - I'm sorry, but it did not do it to me and I like the small, good movies! This did not mourn, though I continued to see him hoping and trusting that it would be so. I was disappointed, especially after two local commentators put it on their list of "Best Year 10". I would strongly recommend you to watch the "Sand House" - now there is a good, small film!
