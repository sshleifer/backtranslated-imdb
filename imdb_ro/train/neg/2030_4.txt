The comment "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. But it is a good idea to see William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, "" the notes on the dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great sketch on SNL or MAD TV - and it does not evaluate a few stars for a view or something to see Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" at new heights - either in a role or as he . But the guy is funny. Girls in the cabin area with the scrolls will be pretty good luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a rebirth of the whiskey-a-go-go gen, with a refreshed demand by women young women to dance in raised cages again. I looked at the first competitor, who was annoying and literally "stranger than a: post," but by chance he left a quarter of a mile or so. The second competitor, somewhat smarter, but lucky enough to win $ 1,000 on Jeopardy !, received the zonked card that required a special question he did not know and who stayed with the zilch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This multitude of game shows that puzzling and sometimes attributing large sums to everyday people are, of course, a cheap, overall effort to try to defeat the spectators. Even if the host is well off and they give six digits in an average episode, I assume that revenue versus costs may be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom distribution in which more stars get six or seven digits on the episode, with some large residual offers as well. But I suspect that even the best will wear thin before long. It has already reached quite a lot at this point. I think his offers, especially with James Spader and the others on "Boston Legal", should give us a satisfactory quantity to Bill Shatner's offers. Again, the rating above is simply fit to see Bill Hop and prance, maybe once; which should be enough.
