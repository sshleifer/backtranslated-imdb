I have to confess that I am very disappointed. This version can not in any way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I saw that I was not completely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the captain I was I imagined when I read the book. And he was too. Unfortunately, this is the only quality of the movie's redemption. The rest is as un-Austen as possible. Miss Elliot should NOT have gone through the Bath streets like this. It was not in its character and was not made by a lady of those times. Anne Elliot was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes in the book, they are at completely inadequate moments, warning those who know the book that another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it feels that everything is rushed. Very little attention has been devoted to introducing the characters to show their motives and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could he possibly have ruined his final scenes in this way? A disaster! And it was not as photographed as the other. No no no. If you love Austen, then do not waste time with it.
