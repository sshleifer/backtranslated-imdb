Until this movie was released, I saw Corus Line 4 times on the stage and I was looking forward to the long-awaited production of a movie in the story. My wife and I were in the hours before the opening of the box office on the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a blow in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story has been "moved out", so to speak, by including scenes that are not within the limits of the theater. These limits represent much of the significance and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (allocate your own order): one of the original songs has been removed, with a very dynamic dance number; a song that was NOT in the scene was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. Now I've seen Chorus Line on the scene 6 times and I do not mind seeing 6 times before I die. It is wonderfully written, with wonderful music and true stories. If you want to see a musical that includes an extraordinary audition of "cattle", we recommend everything that jazz. If you want to see the A Chorus Line story, you see it on stage.
