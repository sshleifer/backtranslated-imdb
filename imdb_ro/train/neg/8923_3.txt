Just like Orson Welles thirty years earlier, Mike Sarne was given "the world's largest train", but unfortunately he would have missed the ability to do more than track his train by becoming a wreck of the train, and a strange kind of astonishment. In spite of postmodernist interpretations that would have liked to see it as a gay or even feminist route, the fact is that it was a major disaster in the 1970s and remains one today. How would somebody have the resources at Mr Sarne's disposal so that a secret remains in the red. Only Michael Cimino has ever approached the political and artistic Armageddon that is the "Gate of Heaven". All of the films seemed to be ego trips for their directors, but at least Cimino had made one of the best films in the 1970s, before squandering the studio, while Mr. Sarne had only the Joanna cabinet in his closet. In addition, the "Gate of Heaven" boasted memorable and well-handled sets, where, tragically, the Myra Breckinridge closet was empty. It is simply the worst example of comforting the hand that feeds on Hollywood history.
