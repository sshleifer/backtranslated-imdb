I want to start by saying I'm Republican, even if I do not agree with the many things Bush did in his office. And I love the daily show and the Colbert report. There have to be two of my favorite TV shows. I'm glad of Bush's jokes on Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest man to ever go to earth (I think it's not the worst.) But it comes to a time when it's enough It's not that funny. I saw where it can be funny and it's (it makes him have fun with our figure of authority that he's hilarious). Central comedy, however, tries to have fun with it. Maybe maybe a special episode, but a whole series is just stupid. Apparently CC says just the same joke bushes I've heard many times. I really can not see this show going over a season.
