As a girl, Hinako moved from his small village to Tokyo, leaving behind two of his best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns like a young woman, surprised to learn that Sayori died when she was a teenager. He reunites with Fumiya and is terrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resuscitated through Shikoku Island. Oh boy. I rented this because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a beautiful actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, she would be "frustrated." This film is silly, boring, poorly filmed, non-imaginative and, above all, unspoiled. Kuriyama has minimal interpretation time as Sayori rises and her character does not have much to do.
