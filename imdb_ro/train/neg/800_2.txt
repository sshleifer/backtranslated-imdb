In fact, this film, made in 1999, has fairly good production values. The actors are attractively attractive and talented. There is not a bunch of clowns running around the explosion to spend hundreds of rounds, but never to hit the meat. There is also no hunting / car crashes when thousands of dollars worth of beautiful cars are destroyed unnecessarily. The interiors look respectably modern, architectural, and the equipment looks at tobacco bags. Well, there is a high-tech computer room equipped with what looks like the scrap from an electronics lab in the 1950s. And the rinse makeup on the corpses broke me. Do not make-up pancake in the conventional sense, but what seems like dry batter of pancake slathered over their exposed skin. This should support the idea that organisms have calcified - although the way the virus would perform this transmutation is an exercise left for the pupil (spectator). Yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the worst absolute premise for fantasy fantasy science that I know, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted through a television screen (or computer monitor) and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp drives a Star Trek are one thing, but do photons become viruses? This is so stupid that the desired "fear factor" is not feasible. The movement could have used one of those terrible dreams in which the dead come alive or have a cat jumping from the closet or something like the viral work does not. It is assumed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this inability that Lord Oliver gave to some of his later places. She needed money. No other comparison between the two should be interpreted.
