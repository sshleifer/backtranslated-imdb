Even though many people here praise this movie, I must warn you. It has no logic. I think Basinger does a decent job in acting, but you can not make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism. This scene presents a good picture for you: While Basinger is being watched by criminal criminals, he decides to sit down and look at an image he finds out of his pocket. The picture is from her daughter and she says "we love mommy." Who does that? What? And believe me when I say it's not as bad as other scenes of the movie. Someone said it was a "hidden gem". Well, you have to disagree, this movie has been hidden for a reason. And it's not a jewel. Oh, and please, I do not even want to start commenting on the red box. It hurts my brain: D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this film is practically possible only because of the lack of logic. But, I still give a 4, because even if it is disturbing in logical error, it has a certain state of mind that kept me looking to the end. So if you choose to look at this, you know you've been warned.
