Our teacher showed us this movie in the first class. I have not seen it since then. I just looked at the trailer. Shows this movie as a first-class movie for you? I do not think. I was so horrified by this movie that I could barely track it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain, who cut the little girl in half and then he was the ketchup boy! I was scared of this movie. Today, being 20 years old, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and my opinion that maybe little children should not see this movie, even if it's about the PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this information to children. I do not even remember what it was all about, once!
