All I can say is that I'm glad we torn stockings while I was watching the movie or I would be upset because I lost 2 hours of my life. The act was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious with my husband and I laughed aloud. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
