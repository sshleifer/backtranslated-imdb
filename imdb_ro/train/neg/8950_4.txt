I've heard of this novel a long time ago, many of my friends recommended me to read it. I searched it everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that every man needs to read, because he is a genius and because of his vision. I liked every page. I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. When I was finally very disappointed, many things in the book are not in the movie (I do not think this is a spoiler) that makes the film not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director, but a writer bad. Especially as an adoptive book. The film is not dark, the writing is very bad, the only good or even wonderful thing is the act. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I saw as Winston Smith. What bothers me most is the people in IMDb who have called this "best adaptation ever" without even reading the book! Or knowing something about writing the screen! You can only understand the brilliance of reading the book, you do not consider this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. The points I gave for this film are for acting.
