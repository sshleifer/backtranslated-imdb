First of all, I'm a great fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, "A Wrinkle in Time". This movie, however, has ruined my enthusiasm. I'm sorry, but Meg has been described in the book as having loops and physical glasses and considered very non-alcoholic. In the movie, she has straight hair and has no glasses and is the "sporty guy" with deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle presented Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg relied on Madeleine's character and described how she felt when she was young. This is just an important example in which the book and the film are different. I would say that if you want to look at her for entertainment purposes, watch her, but if you are a fan of Madeleine L'Engle and the Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest to skip this movie.
