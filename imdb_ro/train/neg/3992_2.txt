Director Spike Lee is famous for making films that highlight racism. In many movies, such as "doing good," most white people are brutal racists. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject, and racism is the whole issue again. What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrating his fanaticism against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the movie world. If Lee or anyone else would ever have produced such prejudices against another group, he would have been vilified, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. Ossie Davis, a reverend in this movie, shoots his son and then puts the devouring weapon on the tip of his Bible. It brings me closer to that for another detail if you lose it. Hey, folks, here's another reader of the Bible and look what it is! Lee does such things in almost all the movies he does. He shows the same hatred when dealing with racial relations. Who could argue that it would describe racism as a bad thing? However, Lee perpetuates this film as in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards the white people does not help the situation. It just adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: Start "doing the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better, "pass it". This is too bad because the subject could have made a provocative film if it were done with objectivity and intelligence.
