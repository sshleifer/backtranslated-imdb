Unlike many, I do not find the premise or theme of this at least offensive show. Its execution, however, is another matter altogether. Like so many B-minus films, all decent gangs seem to have been stuck in trailers. For most of the 22-minute minutes, I stand waiting for any real mischief. Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with remote control or counting carpet fibers. With a few exceptions, the act is terrible; the excessive storytelling and comic gesticulation of some casting members might be suitable for a late infomercial, but not for a spring sitcom (even for a Canadian). Despite the authentic cultural angle, I can only believe that it is mainly incorrectly shot by CBC to reproduce the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they received the tone - and the script - completely wrong for the prairie. The final insult is that they could not even afford to make their location in a small town (Why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be fooled by the outside of the Queen's downtown? As a proud Canadian, I hope that this will soon disappear and that the rest of the world, prepared by CBC publishers, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
