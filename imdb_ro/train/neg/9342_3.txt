The closing of our 1929-30 "Our Gang" release, "A Winter Hard", has two subjects. First of all, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a winter day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer sends directions to Mary Ann from a radio kitchen show. Problem: Wheezer transmits information from various shows and Mary Ann ends up putting the soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang appears to shoot the taffy and get it all over the house! The second story deals with Stepin Fetchit, a Gang neighbor / master, and his interactions with the Gang. "A hard winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, though it is available on video at home. The reason for this is the characterization of Stepin Fetchit, which shows a fluctuating, cunning and slow character. Producer "Our Gang," Hal Roach, called Fetchit as "comic" and used this "Our Gang" as a pilot for a series of Fetchit comedies that never saw the light of day. Obviously, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been overturned. Although there are funny moments with both Fetchit and taffy, "A Winter Hard" meandering effort. If a positive one came out of this film, Hal Roach studios have become confident and experienced in talking. The sound in the movie is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film opened the way for the excellent films 1930-31 "Our Gang". 3 out of 10.
