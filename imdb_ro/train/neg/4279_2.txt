I found a DVD of "I Dream of Jeanie" in Wal-Mart's $ 1.00 basket. When I saw it was "Stephen Foster's story", being a music and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year he was doing because he did not say on the cover, but it was just a remake of the Sewanee River in 1939. Bill Shirley's presentation to the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. Man does not have testosterone and is a passer by all! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster believed that music publishers were giving him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying for them! In addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a Raymond Middleton's 20-minute segment and "Christy Minstrels" with a black face that plays the songs of Stephen Foster, which were hard to observe at least. I can not believe that anyone would consider this film to be right for you to rise in our present time. It is embarrassment and should be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will never be forgotten ... Also, Eileen Christy's portrait of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this inferior point of Hollywood history.
