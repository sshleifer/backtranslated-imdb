What the? Did you not know that Scooby-Doo fought with zombies? Well, you might not be aware of this little film that was directed by Victor Halperin, who also directed White Zombie four years earlier. That would probably be the second zombie movie made. No, do not look for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies and not even look for the brain being eaten. This is 1936, you know. So what you will see is typical of the period - a lot of talk. <br /> <br /> You will see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'High Hour) and Bela Lugosi's eyes, but it's about that. Zombie in Cambodia, really!
