From the star "MITCHELL", from the director "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are taglines that will normally prevent me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all of the above statements are true! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Blouse"
