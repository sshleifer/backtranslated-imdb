The actress was horrific and they both received the wrong sports ... not only did the skating rules go wrong, but also the Ice Hockey Rules GIRLS. You can not check in ice hockey. Also, do not block for someone. Not all the girls are gross and gross disgusting. I'm playing hockey and I'm only 4'11 and they're asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also, not all hockey players hate the figure skaters. Many current hockey players have once been the skaters themselves. We also skate much faster than those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie that gave people the idea of ​​sucking ... although I must mention that it is difficult to transition between sports because of the fingers on the figure ... of those twin movements that KAtelin making them on the ice you could not do in an ordinary hockey game. Practically prevented the person, which is illiquid. It's also unrealistic to get a HOCKEY scholarship when she imagines her skates. That made me angry that the scholarship would have been used normally for someone who could benefit from the team.
