I hired this movie after hearing that it was not an Oscar, but after seeing it, it's easy to understand why it did not. In spite of beautiful photography, the movie moves incredibly slowly, despite the fact that it has almost no plot. The plot is about a boy trying to reconcile with the deaths of his parents in what may or may not have been an accident (the movie is never clear about that) and how his grandfather told him to tell fairy tales. Fairy tales contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not seem to have any point. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale relates especially to a boy trying to get a magical flower for his dying girlfriend to save his life, but the boy is late to taste the flower first to ensure that it is not poisonous that results while a few seconds is too late to save my girlfriend - my grandfather then declares that the morale is that the boy was too impatient, but that does not make sense, because it was overloading and slowing down to his failure. A perfect metaphor for this movie. <br /> <br /> Skye's photo is beautiful, but Stardust that was released this year is another movie about Skye's fairy tales and beautifully photographed - and is infinitely better than it.
