This is very bad. Lamas shows how a second-rate actor is doing his job. But what is worth watching is the scene in which JO angrily grabs a neck policeman as if to kill them while the tonic plays a song with the lyrics "I have proof of you!" (It makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but we did not find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing in the future ... Too fun for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. Score and songs are more interesting than the script. Ditto sequel. Which raises the question of why it would continue. My understanding was that foreign sales lead many of these films. Do not say much about the world's viewing habits.
