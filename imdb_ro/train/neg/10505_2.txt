If you liked "Blair with," you like that. It has the same things with the camera and the soundtrack, and has the same non-existent plot and moments of suspense. He also has Tom Savini, so if you like "The Dawn of the Dead" by Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn" you are in a treatment. It is an icon and a very good actor as well. Not really. This movie is definitely the most horrible movie I've seen for a long time and I've seen some movies - and the bad ones. I can tell you that I find most fun horror movies in a certain sense, but that was just a waste of time. The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was hollow chick and hot action with all the sharp teeth plastic ... No, just joking. Probably I missed before hit the "send" on the voting form. Stay away, even if she has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
