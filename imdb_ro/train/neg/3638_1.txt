The film portrays France's unresolved issues with its colonial heritage in West Africa (Francophone) through the complex and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (here symbolizing her nation). It is a common and provocative portrait of the young woman's desire to join a traumatic moment from her past, in particular, and the desire of a nation to reach the "other" that she once owned and modeled. This is reflected in how it centers entirely on the concept of travel (or transit) from present to past; the recollection of realities to contemporary contemporary political and economic realities. Characters play a symbolic role, though limited and unconvincing. France, which is a visual representation, as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves an indifferent to her situation, because she seems to be still exhausted with the same naivety she enjoys as a child - in fact, as a child , it seems more to hold on to her reality. The rest of the rag tag is simply forgotten. Black Africans are, at least, the official impressionist portraits of former colonized peoples, colonized by the poor manipulation of the director of her material. They are nothing more than a dark and dying background against which France, like the blythei, asks to seek a world she never knew and hoping never to find in Cameroon.
