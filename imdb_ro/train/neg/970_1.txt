I'm normally not scared of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie came to my mind! is a very simple, yet very effective movie, it has a great atmosphere and this leads to shocking moments, the girl's father who descends on the hill is a true point of view. Another seen was family photography, I did not expect that and jumped into my chair !!! I would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights out will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
