I had the "privilege" of attending a special examination of the film "Absence of Light" on a horrific convention in Ohio. First of all, you know you have problems when the director introduces a movie saying, "Remember, I did not have much money ..." Not that budget-free movies are bad, but when a director uses this as an excuse, the results are always weak. And there is no better example than this undiscovered sleep festivity. In fact, "Absence of Light" marks a premiere in the world of underground cinemas: it's the only time I've seen a casting talented talented veteran, actually bored me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd, and Reggie Banister come in and out of the film and they are as uninteresting as new amateur names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? Everything is so dull, you will stop taking care of anyone or anyone. After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. It is not surprising that most of the casting members attended the event. <br /> <br /> Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from it. With luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
