I'm all for a horror movie "bad" but it was just a bunch of sh sh! T! How can someone call this great or decent film is beyond me. If you like fast editing to cover the special effects, bad action and bad scenario, then go for it! There was no suspense, and the gore factor was ridiculous, because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. On the other hand, I was stupid in the whole movie to wait and see if it did better. There is no luck! I did not see the other Torched film and I doubt if I'm going to bother now.
