The plot is plausible, but the banal, the beautiful and neglected wife of the rich and powerful man, has a wobble with a psychotic piece, then tries to cover it as a psycho strain and blackmail it. But what is developing there is surprisingly illogical. Despite the resources available to the ordinary couple who has money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have only one intern, their lawyer and local police (who say they can not do anything) at their disposal while struggling with suspense and terror. They do not have private security staff (just a fancy security system they misuse), house or field staff, drivers, etc. Even apparently funds to hire non-stop private nurses to care for the hero when they suffer life-threatening injuries, leaving the husband and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brain of a doorbell, and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the least likely and irrational way. Production is an insult to viewers who have lost time with this feeling and murder because they lost the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what did they think?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the public's intelligence for this insipid offer.
