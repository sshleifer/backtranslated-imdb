The premise of this film is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that does not degrade. But the movie fails to deal with him. Instead, he bends for 45 minutes, making his preamble before making the big discovery. Since the audience does not benefit much from seeing a child showing things out, it's a weird choice: the movie has been successfully prevented from any subject. Once the material has been discovered, the film determines too quickly that both industry wizards and blue-collar colleagues want the invention to be crushed, leaving the film with only two delicate moves; inventing the chemical and running from oppressors. I do not understand why anyone would describe this as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comic. It is more about the serious social critique of the day: that capitalism deforms supply chains as well as production. Which, in turn, prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, it is probably true, but without playing with this attitude, the movie is simply a serious argument. You will need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find something here. This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
