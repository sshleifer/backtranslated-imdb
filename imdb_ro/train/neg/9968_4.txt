As ex-professor (!) I have to confess that they are returning through many scenes - "although I continued to follow up. I wonder why?" (Boredom, maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The initial opening scenes proved incredible to me and unfocussed. Also, the plot, although there were some good ideas - the situation of an aid teacher, for example - was not enough focused on the development When it comes to young Mr. Macchio, he speaks like that in every * movie * Crying and acting crying aside, hair styles were the only nostalgic travels (if it is nausea) br /> <br />
