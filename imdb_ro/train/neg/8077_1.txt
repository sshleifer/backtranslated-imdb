I've seen this movie a long time ago ... fortunately it was free. I have to be one of the 20 people who have seen this movie in the theater. I do not remember a lot of things, but I remember that I was incredibly bored, the plot did not make sense, and when I left the theater the only thing I could say was at least now know what the worst movie I've seen ever. I was incredibly disturbed by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun enough for people to survive, why can not they turn it to a comfortable temperature instead of being warm and sweaty ? How stupid do you think we are?
