The younger sister and I are self-proclaimed. I've seen almost everything, especially the zombie. Now, I have seen many good zombie movies and many bad ones. This FAR movie is the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Not only does it act horribly but also the special effects, graphics and zombie makeup was the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadow around your eyes) This is a complete proof that you never have to judge a cover book. Because film coverage is the only sweet thing. do yourself a favor and do not think about this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie where I made a sticky note inside the movie before returning to the movie saying "This movie sucks, do not waste your time, come back now" hahahhaa I do not want anyone else to do it, and lose a good movie night on this POS movie! I do not even know how he got the ratings he did, it should not be negative
