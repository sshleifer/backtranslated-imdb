I was very disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved him. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked at Polyester and I really hate her. The only thing I liked for the movie was DIVINE. He had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
