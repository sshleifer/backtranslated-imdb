I do not know what to say about this terrible movie that has not been said before. Honestly, I just have to get upset. I should have known better when I saw the title of this film as a horrible piece, but I liked the war games, so I pampered my caprice. I will live to regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when government officials explained that their super computer could determine who was a terrorist, how well they played a video game, I knew I was walking, although the land - the good writing - forgot . The list of very, very, very bad plotting diagrams and acting is so long that I would shake IMDb if I tried to post it. For those people who said they saw worse movies than this, please let me know. Actually, I'm curious to see something that could handle this pile of steamed steam.
