well, the writing was very negligent, the direction was more sloppy, and the editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). the act was not bad, but it was not that good. pretty much none of the characters were pleasant. at least 45 minutes of that movie was lost over time, and the other hour was not used anywhere near its full potential. It was a great idea, but another lost idea goes well. could have finished 3 different places, but it has just kept coming to an extremely predictable end for Hollywood. and what was not predictable was so bad that it did not matter. the end is not worth forgetting at all. sandra bullock came out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. the film was also hurried. the movie just is not worth watching, and if I paid for it, it would have been very upset. maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a very good movie and I got one bad one. the movie was not bad everywhere, but I would not recommend it. I gave him 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much and I made it as a character (I just think, super smart). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover the holes of the plot. it was like trying to cover a volcano with a cheap masking tape, it was not nice. anyway, if you see it, wait for the theater or video of $ 1.50, if you do not really like every movie you see, then I think you like it.
