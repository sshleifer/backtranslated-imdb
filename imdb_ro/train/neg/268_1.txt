1 How do everyone without the devices like universal translators or translation microbes understand? The creators of this show realized that people who were taken from different parts of the earth at different times (Attila Hunan was not a contemporary of preliterated Greek cultures and contemporary pyramid builder vikings) speak different languages ​​and can never develop a a language that is so similar to modern English (except for the inflections I do not use), which was influenced by Latin, Ancient Greek, Danish, and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, trust needs to be won, but everywhere the team comes, they are received without suspicion and start to command people around them as their appointed leaders. Of course, real fans would say they are perceived as gods. The people I meet should be shaken by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. 3 History: None. From a visual point of view, you can vaguely remember Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run a local hire suit for a horned plastic helmet and claim to show the side. A small theater group probably has better props. 4 Boring! Another production from Canuck, which, inexplicably, worked for ten years. As a child shows that they can do the class, but anyone who has little knowledge of human behavior and language could not bear to watch the first twelve episodes of season one, as we have done. I really wanted to believe that I found a decent SF show, or I would have shut it down and clean up my computer after the first five minutes!
