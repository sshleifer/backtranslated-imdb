I am rooted in this film because it is a remake of a 1970s television series "Escape into Night", which, though sometimes chaotic and moved, was certainly strange, fascinating and disturbing. The actress in Paperhouse is wooden, an unintentional joke. Overlays did not bring any tension, but they only reinforced the fact that I was staying to look at a shoe. Casting has exasperated the disturbing dialogue that resulted in relationships that lacked warmth, chemistry, or conviction. As in most naked films, there are some good acts of support, these people should be comforted, consoled and sure they will not be held accountable. Of all the possible endings was chosen the most unexpected ... blade than I could have dreamed. "Escaping in the Night" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience and guided with a subtle mind.
