Penn takes time to develop his characters and we care about them. However, there are some real issues with the story here, we do not see a real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is deceived. It seems that it was established in 1963, music is in the late 60s / beginning of the 70s. References and dialogue are 70s / 80s. Potential for a strong climax is present, and Penn allows him to escape. But even with all these difficulties it's worth the clock, but not great.
