This movie was bad beyond faith. I saw it during the San Francisco Film Festival in 2004. Before we started, the theater owner got up and told us how half of the audience left the theater the night before, which happened to be "the premiere world ". I do not think anyone in the theater understood how bad the movie was at that time. We all have understood to the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary though it was sold as one. Dark Angel was a bad biography and a bad homage to Betty Paige, where half of the movie is actually a remake of Bettie Paige's old movies. The film has a length of only 90 minutes and the content of the 90 minutes is at least under the hair. A scene would start to go, then someone would say "wow you are so great Bettie, why do not we make another movie?" this would be followed by a minute of a remake of Betty Paige, which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. until the end of the movie people laughed every time another remake of Bettie Paige's film appeared. it was so ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in that theater, but people did not laugh with the filmmaker, laughed at the film and their bad content and structure. This was easy to say because the parties who would have the most laughs were those that should have been serious or revealing. <br /> <br /> I know movies are expensive. I have seen many independent films made independently, but in a way the cinematography and the quality of this film have put it apart from anything else I have ever seen. The film shows it was made for $ 12. Cuts, granulation, and lack of sensual plot have made this experience memorable. This movie makes "Man, Where is my car?" looks like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the feeling of theater as if I had just paid $ 8 to be tortured. The only part redeeming the experience was that we have to laugh at the fact that someone actually did this film and thought it was good. Apparently, last night, on the "world premiere" night, the director / writer / producer had been audience and witnessed that people were laughing and going out on film. Bettie Paige's movies have been destroyed. It should destroy this movie.
