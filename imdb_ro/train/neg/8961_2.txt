This movie was another waste of time ... Why oh why am I continuing to rent shit like this? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. back to the movie in your hand: Cube Zero is probably worth the first movie (as I did) and I just want to check what's happening in the last (hopefully) the movie shot together just to keep some poor actors and scriptwriters, then, of course, this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with good action and a fantastic plot ... * bad smile * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK I'm lying ... At best, this movie It sucks. Okay, I have to admit that some elements for that were great ... well ... cool ... and I laughed a few times, prolly about the wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But all in a few things that just make "ok" is not enough to make this movie worthless. If you do not count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the first ten EVER movies!
