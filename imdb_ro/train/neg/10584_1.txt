The only quality of redemption of this film is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry to give up. In fact, I have seen better action in low-budget pornography. Although I actually rented a kind of gay pornography after this classic scene: Jim: Look at your ass Nick: Look at you (together): I'm not leaving you behind! horrible is production, but it's very funny: good boys have transforming guns! In a scene, they all have HK MP5 fake guns. Next scene, AK-47 replies! And then, at first everything, I do a weapon that changes between scenes with a few M-16s! I think they had a budget deficit for weapons, not enough to go between the good boys and the bad boys. The battle scene is poorly coordinated and false like all hell. You need to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade to explode alone. You can not trigger a missile launched in any way while traveling inside a helicopter. The weapons you throw do not appear quickly. When a weapon is removed from the bullets, its throwing is still pretty bad. If you have no idea how to reload them. Large trucks moving in the first step get into the awkward action scenes. I really do not think movies like this are actually produced. This movie would be hilarious about nitrogen oxide or just drunk.
