somewhere I read that this movie should be a comedy. after seeing her, I would tell her something else. the point of view of this film eludes me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be later and, despite all the nudity and sexual content involved, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... all of them letting me wonder what I do not care about this thing! the premise of the title could have been the basis for a fun comedy (if it is not a politics). Instead, we are treated to cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for their sake. if I want this, I'm going to buy a CD with jones grace.
