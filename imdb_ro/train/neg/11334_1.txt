Here is another European blasphemous story, in which they destroy the religion of their country. (These atheist film actors are unceasing.) Here we see a brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic). This has actually earned an Oscar for the foreign film. This is probably because the story has made Catholics and religious beliefs in general seem extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as an idiot. No wonder the Academy dominated by secularism loved this film. There is also a madman who has a boring one who plays a guy who gives up his religion to marry one of the four daughters presented in the story. Women face a seduction in turn with the "seminarist" student (who says he has studied for six years but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie? This is a shame and another excellent example of the secular-progressive filmmaking of world affairs (not just Hollywood).
