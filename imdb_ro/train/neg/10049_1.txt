I love the Masters of Horror series, often misunderstood. Horror fans live in a constant lack of food. The projects of this kind (and the project similar to the "Greenlight Project" gave us the "Feast" - as we do or grab it) are reasons to reproduce the wonderful bubbles of thought in the minds of directors with a dread of dread to develop and to bring food for us to love to eat in horror. It started with a real-kool kernel idea and ran away ... right from the edge of "where in the world am I going with this?" I do not know how to ruin the spoil, but "SPOILER AHEAD" at once. ... no, it was that light that floated over the night sky early ... we have a bright brightening hair with a long hair ... (HUH?) drilling brain and ... yes, I understand ... but .. the worst curse of the story - a starvation and a promising set up without a perfect perfection. <br /> <br /> Cue for storytellers ... your building must have a payment that exceeds the accumulation. Not the reverse. Storytelling Math 101. The End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
