Basically, the movie blows! Blair Witch meets Sean Penn's mischievous fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what "the war on terror" means. Writing sounds like it was written in the 8th grade (it is not offensive to the 8th grade); the two main actors overtake the whole movie; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (not that they know anything about those things - but they did not look like the real documentaries I've been watching), and the worst of all, Christian Johnson did great idea and made her suck. He reminded me of the moment when I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and came into a very bad figure that looked something more like a huge crow. I'd rather have a look at Blair Witch VIII, than just sit back over it.
