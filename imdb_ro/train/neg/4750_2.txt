He would give him a 2/10. I was really, really disappointed. The story was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and short, so the morale was not clearly evoked. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a difficult time managing his role. I have seen the need to put Western elements into the show, however there are certain parts in which Chinese elements were also required! The bad one, for example. Its physical appearance resembles a robot instead of something from Chinese culture. The final and most serious defects were the incorrect and distorted facts presented in the show. Others might point out that this is a show of the "Kid's Show" and, therefore, there is no need for such standards. However, there are other Disney shows such as Mu Lan who were much better in terms of development and presentation. To conclude, I think Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts movements that depend.
