First I'd like to excuse my bad English. I'm not a hardcore fan, but I liked the movie. Live feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen a gore movie with a gorgeous action, but hey, who's surprised? Actor Live Feed was ... okay, not there! I've seen some commenting on this because it must have been a school project or something like that. Okey, but not by the students in the press or in the school that works. He was not class at all! And the story? A very sad job at the Hostel. And what about the gorillas? How about the scenes of psychopathic torture that should make you breathless and let you sweat? That was most disappointing about the movie with a hole! Short, fast and NO edge. Rather than a torture. Okey, where blood buckets, but it did not even seem true. Slaughter and violence reminded more of Braindead than the Hostel or any of the Saw movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed at Live Feed a few times, but that was more disappointing than fun! So instead of losing 80 minutes of watching Live Feed, watch something else!
