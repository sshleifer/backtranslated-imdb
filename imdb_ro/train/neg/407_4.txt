I like special effects and testify new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this film are very good. I've seen most of this movie because it has been on HBO for the past two months. I have to admit that I was able to lose a few scenes, but I'm usually attracted to movies and I've seen some scenes several times. But every time I see some of the "Hollow Man," I feel depressed, almost like a noir movie. I'm not sure why; maybe I do not want Kevin Bacon to be bad and there's a disappointment in it. But I think he testifies how bad he gets. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for emotion (although some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend for young people under the age of 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
