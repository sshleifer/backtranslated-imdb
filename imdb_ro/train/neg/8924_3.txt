It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven scenario. While some of them are witches and hips, quite a bit of it is boring, unhappy and lifeless. Many of the gagi just sit there, lacking sparkle and energy. From distribution, Mae West and Rachel Welch are coming well. Roger Herren as Rusty shines (too bad he did not make more movies). But for my money, it's too much for John Huston, and poor Rex Reed is hardly given a chance to fight. His character seems to be relegated to spin around, wondering what he's doing in this movie. The low user rating should give an idea of ​​the public opinion of this piece. Vidal's original offered great potential that was quite lost. Even "classic" movie clips have not done much. All in all, an effort fairly under the hair, and is not likely to be much better with time.
