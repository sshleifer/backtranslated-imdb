I love Alec Guinness. And that says a lot after this movie. Actually, that's not bad. He seems to be aside, to be urban and his ordinary charm, but to invest the lure. It is obvious that the little girl she is experiencing is a fever, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen it when he was young and obviously not happy about it. The interesting character is the impressive brother of the strange "Suzanne," another babe. "Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep secret was hidden behind the forehead? Was he in love with the father's mistress? Why did he remove Suzanne's hair when he planned to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the ground? Or maybe he just had a lot of inappropriate action. The film would have been charming with Guinness and the "older woman," who remembered and saw Paris together. That would be a wonderful story! Two wonderful people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of the Second World War. Why did not anyone come up with this? I suggest you look at Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but meritorious film.
