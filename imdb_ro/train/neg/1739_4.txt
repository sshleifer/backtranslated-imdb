Watching that lady in Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seems to be heading to Marlene Dietrich. Someone from 20th Century Fox may have decided that a sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. Betty plays an Italian 19th-century Countess, whose field was invaded by a Hungarian hussar band led by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Its ghostly aorta, whose portrait hangs in the palace, along with the rest of the family tree, sees no likeness in Doug now, and another invader 300 years earlier with which he dealt with when the armies failed. Besides, the current Betty was just married to Cesar Romero and the invasion came at a very inappropriate moment before things were over. That will give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, healthy all Betty American is NOT an actress to make seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have put her head on her head, but with Betty she was more paid than the presidential candidate yesterday. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can follow in anything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this movie and Oscar "This Is The Moment" for Best Song. This Lady In Ermine, a chance for Oscar glory, fell to Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died halfway through the movie, and Otto Preminger finished The Lady In Ermine. I can not believe Lubitsch took care of Grable for the leadership here. You will not see her if you see that lady in Ermine.
