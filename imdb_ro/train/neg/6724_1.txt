When you choose a movie, I hope that a factor that you will consider is the actors in the film who use their fame to influence positively or negatively the moral structure of our society? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that has an impact on society. When a comedian / actor makes a series of sexual and racist comments about a teenager and her father, should we ask ourselves (I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's behavior is tearful to the social structure that teaches the young man of evil, good from evil, that loving kindness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx should remember that it's just entertainment and there are many of them to choose from. Saying he's not sorry, do not get him off the hook. He will not hurt evil or eliminate the evil behavior he conveys to the young man. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. I do not see anything I belong to. We can not change them, but we can stop the fame we offer.
