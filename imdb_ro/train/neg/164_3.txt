I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I'm looking forward to this. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its narrow and submarine style, and the harsh technology in comparison with the passages we are used to. I did not see anything interesting about this pilot. I found the plot to be convoluted and confused. I will admit that I liked some of the character's development - people's representations as a teenage species ready to overtake the british were fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> 3/10
