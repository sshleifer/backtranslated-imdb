How many leaves do we have to see a spook who walks in the background and touches a mirror? It was made in two dozen films in recent memory and forty times in this filthy and stupid movie. There were only two strange moments to appreciate ... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Talking about the characters, the act was as flat as the Coca Diet in 64 ounces. the cup from which I fired it. The side characters could have been drawn from various cartoon Scooby Doo. She was the elderly friendly sheriff. It was a strange weird thing that lived in the woods on the bottom of the Mountaintop with the Alabama route. Lots'o'characters without development. The most disturbing picture was the one of a child killed at the beginning. But rather than exploring the killing of the child, which would have been exciting, they announced that she had died and her parents had difficulty reconciling their death with the community and the others. When they get into the cabin, the scenes seldom slipped together ... with intermittent images of the dead daughter forbidden here and there. Oh ... and the extraordinary sounds were also overcome. You know what I mean ... some doors that open themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. I've never seen that before. Again, you will see the stunning door of self-opening of the movie over and over a fish again. NOTE TO THE DIRECTOR: A frightening scene is only scary if it does not repeat every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think of these things before calling "is a wrapper!"
