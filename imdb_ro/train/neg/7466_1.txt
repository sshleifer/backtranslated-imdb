Wow. Some movies leave me speechless. It was undoubtedly one of those films. When I left the theater, no word came in my mouth. All I had was an incredible desire to beat my head on the wall of the theater to help me forget about the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it did not work. Frankly, this movie has nothing to recommend. Humor was at the first level of the class, at best, the act was extremely silly, and the plot was astronomically distant. I swear I will not see any other movie with Chris Kattan or any other SNL member.
