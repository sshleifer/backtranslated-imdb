This movie was a confusion at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but I must say that it was a bad choice just like when she made Ring Around the Rosie, that none of her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was much better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She dragged me completely, and at last she was crazy. It's about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who comes to the funeral of her twin sisters. She lives at a house that her sister owns and a grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationships to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she's trying. Ravins have a weird part in it. When relationships go to sleep, ravens eat organs so they can not sleep. But they do. Virtually all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried, but not dead, and that they must suffer forever so that Mary Ellen will remain alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If not, I'm sorry. I love you.
