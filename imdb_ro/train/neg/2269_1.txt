Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and actually has everything that's going on in the show! Well, if the idea does not intrigue you, what you should not, stay away from the ringmaster. I was dissatisfied with seeing this in the theater and being able to stand right through this film disaster. I think jerry springer does not play himself, as shown by the cheap props for his show (yes, looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he is known only as a jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can say it) is about a daughter while you live with her mother decides to start sleeping with his mother living in his beloved. So, the brilliant idea of ​​her mother is to call the jerry springer show and to receive her with her daughter's boyfriend. (It's a coincidence that I live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, elsewhere in America, a woman finds her husband and her boyfriend in bed together. So, of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I'd talk about the rest of the movie, but I'm just thinking about the movie now giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, seems totally unattractive in the movie. And remember Michael Dudikoff, the American ninja series karate boss? Well, take a look at him now like a drunk white drink. The thing is, it really looks too horrible and in shape to call it "to get in touch with him." But if your idea of ​​fun sees Jerry Springer singing a country song about his show or guys who get in touch with the transvestits ... well ... Look at INSTEAD! ... at least Steve was smart enough to be out of the picture.
