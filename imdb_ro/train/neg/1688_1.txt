Gee, what was that movie! I can not understand what people find so scary about The Grudge. The director plays a trick (I should admit a very good one, which is brought to a very stylized life) and then repeats it for the rest of the movie again and again. Consequently, I was surprised several times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew about the exercise, I practically fell asleep as The Grudge became more and more predictable at the time. In conclusion, I can say that there are several better movies in the beginning, that the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was more frightening and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
