As for the HEIST movies, it's pretty weak. Continuity is bad enough, character continuity is not enough to really feel you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he's one of the reasons why he's worth watching. Falk has some wonderful lines, such as "he'll be right back, he'll buy some envelopes," or something like this ... there are some pretty scenes, though it's all due to the actors' efforts. Direction, script, and editing are pretty bad.
