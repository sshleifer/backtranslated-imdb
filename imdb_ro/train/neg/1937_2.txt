In the first half hour or so of this movie I liked it. The obvious stormy tale between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was nice to watch and I wanted to see it happen inevitably between them. However, once the action passed to Ingrid's fiancé's house, everything was completely disintegrated. Instead of romance and charm, we see some parallel characters who do nothing, strange, that destroy their movie. The fierce son of the fiancé and the military attaché that turned to the attention of the maids seemed bad - like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. The way the charm and elegance of the first part of the movie can let go of sportiness is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to regain his success with GAME RULES because the film is very similar once the action moves to the country resort (as in the other movie). I was not a big fan of GAME RULES but ELENA AND THE BARS made him appreciate the art and nuances of the original film.
