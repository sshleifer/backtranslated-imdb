Really a terrible movie. It is to be expected, however. Clearly, a low budget: nothing innovative, an actress (if you can call what "acting") always has nudity roles in a shower scene, a man in a reptilian suit almost modeled after the predator, forests, etc. But there are some redemption points. Though the story is not new, for the most part there are some parts that are not so regurgite. For one, the black guy does not die when he attacks (the first time) and he's not even one of the first to die. But that's minor. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on the experiments of Kat and Wes & Steve that I have not seen. When Steve told Kat that he knew what he was doing, I thought what he said and what Kat said. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of revelation. It could be due to my lack of experience with the genre or the fact that it is a very intelligent reality. In any case, the movie is bad enough and you do not watch it if it's any better on ... Unless you can make a cheap movie.
