This film is nothing but a series of tense, well-designed sequences dotted with a "must-have!" Inevitable! at the end of each. Indeed, there is no character development and no real plot to talk about. There are only the most skeletal motivations for the characters to do something while heading for their inevitable vases. It is just an excuse to show a ghostly child (who seems to have brought some of the family cat mixed in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with his long black hair hung in front of him, like the "Ring") Take down a bunch of cut-out carton, two-dimensional excuse for human characters. This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you need to live. It is not recommended.
