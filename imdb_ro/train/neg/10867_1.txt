This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do a lot better than that (acting, writing and guiding) 2) it's so bad I have to leave a review and warn others. .. <br /> <br /> Looks like he was shot with the flip video. And I think my friend who told me to look at that has a vendetta against me. I noticed there are some positive posts for this home video; He must have been left by the crew members of people who are related to this film. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. we hope the writers and the director will leave the business. not even talented enough to make commercials !!!!!
