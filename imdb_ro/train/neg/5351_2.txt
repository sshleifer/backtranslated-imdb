If you liked the first two movies, I'm sorry to say you will not like that. This is really rubbish and useless directly to the video, perhaps the continued TV made. The idiot, but beautiful, scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own firm, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid that he gets his statue and his brother himself. Then he collects his wife and sister-in-law. Now, adults have to find a way to make the children of the home make them bigger. Quite a repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, a roller coaster toy, swimming in dip, etc. Pretty poor!
