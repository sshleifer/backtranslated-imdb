I was lucky enough to see a line of choirs when it came to my city .. I was younger then .. but it was an excellent game .. so somebody please tell me why in the name of the sky they have done to make a movie out of .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He did not fit the role .. this movie really suffocated BIG time !!! my advice is NOT to rent this movie .. save money for something better like "Cats" ....
