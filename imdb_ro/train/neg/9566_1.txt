I've seen a lot of movies. He first saw Wargames years ago and loved it. Computers where it was still a "great mystery" for most of us and the movie was convincing in this way. However, it looks like a small special budget on Wednesday night. Total carp from the beginning to the end. The terrain is so weak, you will not believe until you see the movie (which I would not recommend first). I can not emphasize an actor who really did a good job in this movie. But with this scenario, I would have been surprised if someone could do a good job. Many cliche scenes. CGI seems to be out of version 86. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm bad about just writing about it. DO NOT watch this movie. Life is short to be scattered for watching terrible movies.
