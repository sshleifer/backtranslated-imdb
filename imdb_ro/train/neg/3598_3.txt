Do you know when you look at your collection of old, filmed movies and do you understand that there are some that you have seen only once or twice and can not remember if it is worth the time to see them? Alibi is / was one of these movies; I found it, not long ago, and I decided I could give her a chance. I'm not sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie is really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free band ... yes, you understand. The plot is predictable and is in no way original. Pacing is bad. The act is bad, but that's not surprising, seeing the two leaders are the stars of the former opera soaps ... they are used to surviving. The characters are badly written cliches. The film even manages to deceive the easiest way to impress me (through the movie): scenes. Even those do not give any emotion to or against any thin cardboard character. The movie has no real quality of redemption ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clich√©s that it's ridiculous. And this is the only thing that raises this over a 1/10 rating: ease (albeit unintentionally) the comic of numerous cliches and stereotypes. I did not pay too much attention to the movie, but every time I looked at the screen, it was something to laugh at. A final note: I considered using the "Tori Spelling can not act" line as a one-line summary, but I think everyone knows this, so I chose the current one, seeing it more informative. All in all, a very bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Okay for a few laughs if you can sit on it. 3/10
