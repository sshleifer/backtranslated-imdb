I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, which I did not see in any Rocky IV movie. Unfortunately, this movie was a great disappointment. The action of all the parties was bad, except for Mr. Lundgren, who was all right. Kata Dob√≥ was a nice thing to look at despite her ridiculous coat and makeup. The plot is not at all intelligent, it's something that has been repeated millions of times in different films. The brothers were completely stereotyped, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I did not really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not really a decent action. Every return to the scene is extremely predictable, and the incredible amount of unrealism over the head and comic book characters began to piss off pretty soon. I would recommend this to young children who want something comic-like action, but unless otherwise available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in making this film)
