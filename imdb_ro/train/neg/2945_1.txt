I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he could not make this movie pleasant. The only reason I've seen it to the end is that I learned the video production and I wanted to make sure our students never did anything wrong ... but it took my whole intestinal force to stay in it. It's like watching your grandmother flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... with scary pains. If you took the real movie, soaked it in the paint and then you saw it, it would be more fun. Seriously. If you see this movie in the S-Mart trash, turn away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
