NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB and all the other snoop agencies in the world should watch this movie to get information on how to spy on people. (as says in MST3k Commentary ... "Health has the dirt on everyone!" Santa Claus Tentacles get far and do not hide from the Klaus organization ") From telescopes that can spy millions to the ears that hear everything. it's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa Claus on salaries. <br /> <br /> Dance's rhythm is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Pitch ... it's so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor in this movie is extraordinary. It is recommended to watch the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000 to laugh. <br /> <br /> You really have a laugh at the joy of the good kids <br /> <br /> give me a 1 for quality production and a factor of 10 for cheese and fun factor.
