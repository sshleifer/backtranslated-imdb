This bizarre adaptation of Borges' story is typical of Cox. Its powerful visual meaning is, as usual, overturned by the half-awful half-baked acting of most of the cast. The film is certainly in the surrealist tradition of Bunuel's Mexican times and looks at the times when the poor man takes Lars Von Trier's Crime Elements. Cox's apparent preoccupation for a single output, a reduction of tasks, and a recording of ambient sound, all work against the effectiveness of the film. It's worth a look, but ultimately disappointing.
