1 is quite generous here. I really liked BOOGEYMAN, even if it is not even BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! I dragged myself. But this movie is something else. Because he was directed by a guy who has long traveled and directed a lot of movies, he seems to have been shot on a 10-year-old VHS video camera! Story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you left me too. After you played one of the most dangerous villains in the history of the movie, did you resort to that? Story and acting could have been forgiven, however, if anyone had time to make the film look somewhat professional. There's a lot of video shot out there that does not look like this, or at least not so obvious that it distracts your attention from the movie. I can not say it's the worst movie ever, because I could not make it all the way, but it's definitely close.
