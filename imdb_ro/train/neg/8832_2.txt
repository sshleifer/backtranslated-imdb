I had a very hard time getting through this move. It was extremely slow and sometimes asked when the screenplay would actually come to life. This movie seemed to slow down and I continued to wonder when it was going to end. I am normally a person who likes a good indie file from time to time, but this did not meet what I was looking for. They seemed to have tried to make much of this movie. At one point it seemed to be turning into politics that I am not a big fan of movies. If you are looking for a slow motion movie with little to no plot, then this is the right movie for you. As far as I'm concerned, I felt that I lost two hours when I could do something else.
