I learned about Zodiac for four years. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anyone else ... In fact, of most people who know and read and learn about Z, I'm prolly with the least knowledge ... But I know or at least I think I know most things in this would not happen ... How he signed his name ... how he killed people ... I thought the godfather was the worst movie ever ... <br /> < Cinematography has been a year of five ... I'm not saying my movies are better, but I'm not someone making movies for the mass population ... The actor I'm I thought most of it was pretty good I really did ... the leadership did not talk so much on the camera or everything I forgot and do not know because I stopped watching .. his voice over the waves <br /> <br /> But you really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a big pizza or something ... <br /> <br /> Until I learn how to write a review, Psycho Phil
