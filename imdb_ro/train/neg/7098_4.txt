An interesting idea for a movie that shows both the last dragon on the earth and the struggle that he and his evil have together. When younger, Einon was stabbed in his heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) led him to the dark man who gave him half of his heart. Now grown up, Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new Draco Dragon friend (expressed by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for killing the dragons. But because Einon has half of Draco's hearing, both feel the pain in one of them is injured or killed. They also starred on Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert de Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Worth seeing!
