I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I was not a massochist, I do not know if I'd survived watching. It looks like it costs about $ 1,000 to make, but not the money that brought them. The act was horrible - not just bad, class III students could have read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason to watch this type of movie is skin, and which is extremely deprived of this movement. We do not even see the more appealing chicks of the buff. <br /> <br /> Well, more luck next time eh?
