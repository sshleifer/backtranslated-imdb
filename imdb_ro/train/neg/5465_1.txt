This movie has a special place in my heart, the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just as fun as doing hard work with stomach cramps. The movie starts inappropriate (I'd give the first few minutes of the movie to 1/10) and then worsen gradually, minutes per minute. The only way to evaluate it at all would be a kind of negative spiral number that grows for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but best describes the humor of this video. Somehow, the video even manages to make nice, thinly dressed females and sex looks grotesque and disgusting. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing again with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA, who flew in your ear rather than watching this movie. Continuing is not as bad. If you have to rent a Troma movie, take Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather see 5 Tony Little's information in the back than see the NUKEM HIGH CLASS again. Do not get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make this movie terrible, and if ever a movie deserves a prize because it's terrible, that's right.
