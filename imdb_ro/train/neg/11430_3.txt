Okay, let me write a new word here: polyphony: the fear of polyamorous relations. This is another one from a long series of movies that start from the audience about a certain type of three, just to turn a penny and to specify how much is necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution . Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. Mark my words: For decades now, polyphobia will be as big as a famous step like homophobia, but guess who's too close to understand that? The very first time: the producers of this film. And so many like it. Why do you even make a movie like this kind of modest and conservative? Preoccupied with the fact that it has no limits to openness to homosexuality, it completely ignores the fact that we live in an age where monogamy turns into a sequential monogamy, which in turn turns into swinging and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! This is a disappointing, run-of-the-go chicken-flick. (But, damn it, I have to say Heather Graham is the nicest thing in life.) 3 out of 10.
