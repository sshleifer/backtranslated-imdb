I happen to be the nephew of the director. It took me years to get a copy of this movie and I can confirm that this is indeed one of the most serious movies of all time. My uncle has no copy of his (I asked him). I look forward to bringing him a copy. Currently, the average rating of the movie is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell you, it should be placed somewhere in the mid-1930s in IMDb's "bottom 100" but with only 206 votes, it was not still placed. the film does not even have the respect of a lower title 100. In any case, I give my children to the family members this year for holiday gifts. The Best / The Worst Gift Ever?
