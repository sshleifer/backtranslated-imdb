I expected a comedy like "Big Mama". Instead, the film was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. This film has three plots: The first involves Madea and taking it into an adoptive child. The second involves a woman who is engaged in a rich man who abuses her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. In fact, there is a very small comedy in the movie. There are also a series of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the adoptive child with a belt (in a comic manner) to convince the child to straighten out. The child, in fact, returns. Apparently, it pays to beat the kids. There are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with the elderly who paint young girls who are related to them. (The mirror takes place at a family reunion.) The film jumps from plot to plot so it's always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, there is nothing ... except for the waste of time and money.
