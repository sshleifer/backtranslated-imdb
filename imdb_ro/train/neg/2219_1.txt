Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween is presented by the memorable Michael Myers and a great action by Jamie Lee Curtis. However, its readjustment factor is very close to zero, there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on boredom / culmination at real events. This is a kind of movie you can take away from microwave popcorn and do not lose anything at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> As such a lot of continuity has been born, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God God Rob Zombie repeats this. And, in general, I hate remakes. Surely, it will compensate more than all random fill voids with some strange points of interest that the original is missing. <br /> <br /> It is a movie we feel we should like, just as we have learned that we should enjoy Dickens. It does not assume it's a classic.
