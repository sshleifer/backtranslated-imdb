An Italian / American co-production that collaborates with Linda Blair and David "The Hoff" Hasselhoff: How could any fan of terrible horror resist such treatment? Well, relying on the unusual, and completely meaningless in the first forty minutes, I would have said "very easy"; However, things are becoming more fun by introducing more inventive death scenarios, and for those who are lucky to find an uncut copy and nudity (unfortunately, my copy was edited optically to remove such offensive material). Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) in a ruined hotel on a seemingly deserted island to take pictures of his latest project, Witch's Book; while Gary, frustrated, hopes to try and cure a bad blue balls case, releasing Leslie from her virginity. His plans for nookie are spit on the unexpected arrival of Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their daughter Jane (Blair), Tommy's son Michael Michael, beautiful nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) island hotel. After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are greeted by the new owners of the property, and when a violent storm rises suddenly, making it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unknown to the new guests of the hotel, the place also houses the spirit of the evil witch (Hildegard Knef), which requires human sacrifices to return to life. One by one, the victims are drawn into a red red vortex (which is guaranteed to offer unintentional laughter) before meeting a terrible fate. Nothing makes much sense, and the action is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff turns out to be one of the best performers talking about the others), but those spectators who go beyond the first half are rewarded with some beautiful gorgeous moments: Rose has her lips sewn together before being fried alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hagi and pushed on a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veneers pulsed and burst into blood geysers; and Gary is stabbed in the back. Oh, and Leslie is raped by a lipless guy and Blair gets possessed (again).
