I can not believe that some people prefer this. Still, they are still called Batman fans. It really goes until it says it's better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be plagiarized for them to use Batman's name for this piece of nonsense. It's not Batman. The whole premise of the show is "if you can not beat someone to get a bigger weapon to help you." Batman does not have everything about weapons. He uses his batarang, the hook and the Batmobile, that's it. He does not come up with some ingenious new techniques every time he can not beat anyone. I do not know where the hell they had the idea of ​​a Batbot. or anything else. They destroyed all the villains. Mister. Freeze left a sympathetic scientist to a small criminal who fell into an encryption. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50-year-old woman with a stupid suit. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50-foot top hat. Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, making Dummy the entire central piece of the character. They even had a bad idea to make it a giant! WTF? and the two most serious character changes are those of Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler to a strange guessed / retro teenager. and the Joker to a dreaded acrobat. Looks like a Marley wannabe bob. they completely and completely destroyed Batman even moreso than B & R did! I wish I could meet the creators and / or the writers and animators of this show, so I could hit them with a metal baseball bat.
