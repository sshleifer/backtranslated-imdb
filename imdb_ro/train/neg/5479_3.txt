I bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary expedition expedition to Mexico before taking the Aztecs. She did it well because she never knew about those T Rex who lived in a valley where the locals worshiped them as gods. It was understandable. What it was not was pouring blue eye Ian Ziering as Cortes. Even with blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 black painted, Ian seemed ridiculous. At least he did not make any attempt at a Spanish accent. The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez, also delayed by a series of television with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval in Dallas PD. He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be perfect only if it was not for those boring prehistoric beasts the natives worshiped. Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some exits from the famous series Sid & Marty Krofft The Land of Lost. All that was needed was a Sleestak. If you are interested in finding out about this reconnaissance expedition that did not do the history books well enough, check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try to stand on it with a straight face.
