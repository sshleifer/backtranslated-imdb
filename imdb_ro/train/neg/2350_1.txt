This show was bad. Writing was sucked, the dialogue was sucked. The guy who played Craig could not get out of a bag of paper. Being on Thursday night, it was definitely great to watch a few beers. Good music, bad action, bad writing, all came together for my entertainment. It was a dramatic / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not reveal who was the victim, they had to write the dialogue around him, which was terrible. The funeral gullige was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that have taken place today were completely horrible. Let's revisit. Everything that is happening today is sucked. Retrospective scenes, only Craig's writing, dialogue and action suck. Music still ruled.
