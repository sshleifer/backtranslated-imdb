This film is pretty weak. The actor is dizzying and completely forced. Moreover, by filming the film as a docudrama does not necessarily make it more credible, you can not easily get out of it, Mr. Dir. Do not let my comments mislead as I would recommend watching this movie because it shows a light on the psychology or psychology behind the authors of these crimes. However, the climax of the film is absolutely garbage! There is no other way to put it! It's pure and simply fails to capture any feeling of atmosphere! What happens does not translate any sense of despair, panic, fear, or fear that you will surely feel in such terrifying circumstances. No, instead, it leaves you with a fallen jaw. "Was that what?" sneaking out of your tongue and not haunting you at all of these boys' actions. Rather, you feel embarrassed about another movie that has begun with potential, but it has come to fall on your face in the most crucial point. Zero Day really .... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
