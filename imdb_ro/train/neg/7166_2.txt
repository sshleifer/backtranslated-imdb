This movie could have been very good, but it's coming a long way. Special effects with a musky effect and so on. I could have looked after that if the story was not that bad. If it were more of a background story, it would have been better. The plot focuses on a druid witch who is linked to this woman who receives migraines. The film moves forward and clearly does not explain anything but just continues to spill. Christopher Walken has a part, but it's completely meaningless, like most of the movie. This movie had a potential, but it seems they have been very bad for the TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
