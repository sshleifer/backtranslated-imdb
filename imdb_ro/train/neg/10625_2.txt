I'm in my 11th grade at my high school. In the current class of world affairs, a child in my class had this video and suggested we were looking. That's what I did. I'm faithful to go to the moon, because my dad is working for NASA. Even if I think this movie is the biggest piece of nonsense I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all he had to show JFK that he was shot? And how dare he use all those biblical quotations. The only good thing about this movie is that spark debate, which is good b / c in my class we have weekly debates. This film did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another film. The next Michael Moore movie could be called "A funny thing happened on May 11" or "A funny thing happened on the way to the white house."
