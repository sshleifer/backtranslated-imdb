Pedantic, long-term production attempting to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It starts pretty promising, with a bell ring still relevant to the explosion of a plane, yet the melodrama involving James Stewart and Vera Miles's wife is in the way (Miles had the habit of playing fierce husbands under coercion, and her nervous knees arrived here on the curriculum). Known director Mervyn LeRoy contributed to this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the image fails to make a big impression. Best performance was made by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, although most of the dialogue is ridiculous, and the pace of stimulation causes the movie to look twice as long. * 1/2 from ****
