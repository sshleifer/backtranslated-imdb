You could say, "Don Johnson like Elvis? Can this work? Is it possible? It seems to me a terrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind, maybe it will surprise me." Don Johnson is not a bad actor, but he's a terrible Elvis. He's too short, too weak, too well presented ... and you've already imagined how much it's bad to add a hokey black wig and big eyeglasses and mascara, and it's a big embarrassing embarrassing mess. The best thing to say is that since Johnson's act is decent and since his adornment is so far , after a while, you do not even think of him as Elvis, you see him as another crazy star, then at this level, the movie gets watched, Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally expressed as beauty queen Linda Thompson But she is attractive in her own and plays her role with honesty, elegance and intelligence on her we're expecting it from all its roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be a kind of drug that needs to stay with a drug-abuse dose. There is nothing new in this story; I heard it several times before. If you are looking for new information or information, you will not find it. It is said to be a love story - an irreparable one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
