The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the end made me laugh. I have had great hopes, as I usually like bad horror movies campy, but this did not qualify. It is really a bad attempt to slowly show a character in madness, which, again, is not a bad plot, but it is bad here. There are some scenes (like the end) that are not meant to be funny, but they actually made me laugh aloud. There have been several times when I thought the movie would go in an exciting direction, but it never does what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
