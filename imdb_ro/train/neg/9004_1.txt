Nothing could save this movie, not even Superman. Ten years ago, the special effects would have been amazing. Better direction may have had more sensation and better performance on the part of the actors. But nothing but feeding a dragon scenario could have solved the problem. Draw holes, bad, trembling lines, endless repetition of the same CGI dragon photos that pass through the hallways ... ugh. Avoid this at any cost. <br /> <br />
