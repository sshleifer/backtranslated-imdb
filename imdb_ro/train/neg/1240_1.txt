I think everyone was quite disappointed with this science fiction movie. First, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is the remake of what is supposed to be a classic. It seemed boring, brutal and ridiculous to me. If you saw her, you know what I mean. Almost everyone at Imdb says they're shit and boys, they're right! If not, avoid. He's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
