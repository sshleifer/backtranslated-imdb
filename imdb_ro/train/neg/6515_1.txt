This is not a boring film, the audience might stay on its fascinated seat of this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both a film producer and an actor here. The story is simple: after a divorce and ten years of a Hollywood non-career career, the author plays is the quest for love in front of the room. The first question is about how true is everything: what is written, what happened by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no," interpret M. Berkowitz as a small average of people. If you look at a love fiction like this, I recommend you read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... Besides, I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know that American people usually say that the French are arrogant (which could be true then) etc., and surely the French (and the whole world) have a lot of suffering against America, but why so much hate? Do not you think I would not like this movie just because of that.
