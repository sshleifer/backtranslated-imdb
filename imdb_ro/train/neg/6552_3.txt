Cash (now interpreted by Hrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has wandered into a desolation post-apocalypse (after her protector died from old age, the protector was interpreted by Elias Koteas, a true decent actor) and now finds that people wandering ruins looking for cyborgs for the trade of scrap metal and money. She runs a group of burned cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it's still a pretty dull feature. The problem this time is that potential ideas are never used well, action sequences are routine and distribution names such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are little to do. Haje is an unlucky heroine and Lynch is too upset (as usual) and the film does not have the inspiration or the ambition of being as fun and evil as his hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second one is just boring). Also disappointing is the science fiction angle that resists almost aggressively any good idea it has. As an action shot, this is a routine and through B-movie numbers and is made competent, this is the only positive thing I can say about it. 1/2 out of 4 (Poor)
