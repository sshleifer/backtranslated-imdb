OK - I ADORE this movie ... I'll give this movie - alone - because it made me such a dreadful horror fanatic. I could never see this movie alone. I have also heard many stories about the effect he had in his original release at theaters, spectators. An incredible masterpiece ... Terrible, psychological stuff scares my pants. They will bless their heart, whoever has done this wonderful movie. I like. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - this is the most frightening movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what is happening in the film and the idea of ​​the film are not quite frightening, but what has always been to me - was Brendan's fabulous action. Best EVER Horror Movie. Nothing can ever be so scary. Halloween watches his evilest.
