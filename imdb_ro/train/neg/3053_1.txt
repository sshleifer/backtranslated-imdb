Wow. Who said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This pile of donkey flies is a perfect case at this point; Make "Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards' most serious effects as the first night show. I had nightmares, you know, the awakening and sweating of the bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror Santa Claus had discovered from the seemingly pure ground of my being. However, I can think of some parties where this movie could go well. Also, if you look for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on the VHS tape, stop looking. Do not check this movie because I was informed that the MST3K version is now available. Go over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
