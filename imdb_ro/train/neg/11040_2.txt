You have to watch this show once to see them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something in the way that he means well, but his wife's soul, at the end of it finds out that what she did was really for her, she caresses her cheek and gives her a gentle smile as she looks bravely. In fact, story lines are so bold and formic that I will take a shot at one now. The Valentines Pay Episode <br /> <br /> Jim's wife finds that all weekly Jims pay has disappeared, and then explains that he lost her at the casino. She yells and leaves the house crying how terrible she is. Then, on Valentine's Day, he returns to a limousine with tickets to a ball (thus explaining the missing salary). She realizes her mistake and the usual "Oh Jim, you're so wonderful." The end Another very obvious element is that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson who as a cartoon character can escape being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with human beings do not do not work and Jim just as an arrogant bastard. <br /> <br /> IMO's only reason why this is successful is simply because we are so many now in the field of human beings with TVs, these days you could make a show about a man who is insulting walls and you have to get an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious.
