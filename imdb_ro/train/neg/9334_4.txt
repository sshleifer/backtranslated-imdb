An OK hit, set in Mexico, about a man who hit her (Scott Glenn), who struck a trip with the fought American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a blow. Does he pay them to take him to the border? but things are out of hand. It starts pretty well, but it struggles quickly and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The eventual overturning is wrong and hard to believe. The lack of passion and, in essence, no reason behind her leaving one man for the other, made her ridiculous - and the conclusion was predictable and boring. ** SPOILER END ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the American agent on the hit track, but he seems a little confused about how boring and slow the scenario is ...
