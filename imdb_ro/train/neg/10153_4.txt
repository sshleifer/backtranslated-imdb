SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the producers made it look pretty good considering the small budget had to work with. The film is apparently a "episode" of a Japanese live reality show that sends some competitors to a sealed "dangerous area" and has three costumes sent to them to kill them. The survivor, if any, wins fame and fortune ... anyone else is just dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that the act is bad enough. None of the "real" people seems real. The actors who play criminals are kind of fun ... because they portray typical and topical cartoons of modern modern horror films ... and that's exactly what they would do if it were a real showcase. The film claims that everything is done in a single exit ... there is a cameraman who follows competitors around the "dangerous area" and everything is seen from the point of view of his room ... but the lights continue to blink and stop in constantly (to hide "cuts" from one to another, I would imagine).
