Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a bad piece. I'm surprised she was rated as big as she did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie. The story itself is just stupidity and a clich√©. That's pretty much what it's about ... A pretty nerdy, without friends, is taken away, killed, and returns like a revenge scarecrow. "Everyone" is packed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching it. Also, the second one is not much better, so do not mind that you looked at this ... I rated this movie three, because I liked the scarecrow suit, not because it was something good about the movie. I think you have the picture.
