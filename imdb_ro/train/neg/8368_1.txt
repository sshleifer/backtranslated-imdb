When you look at the little man, you will spend your time trying to figure out a lot of plot holes. And that's not a good sign because this movie should be a comedy! You should laugh at him! But do you want? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little man is his concept - it's too ridiculous to accept (even as a comedy of cartoons) so when working loudly and working over the jokes above, things seem to be ten times more stupid than it is already. "But it's a comedy," some of you could scream. That's true, but that's not an excuse for such an awesome plot. I want to think if you saw a baby with FEMALE SELECTION, would not it be at least a little suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so bad, why did not he put it on a nearby shelf instead of a random handbag woman? And how can a qualified doctor not recognize that Calvin is an elevated man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about plot, about laughing," you might be screaming. Well, heres thing to see, there are almost no laughs in the little man and that just makes the bad stool floor stand more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a Wayans brothers' comedy with a suspicion of faith, stay with the white puppies because at least they had a few decent laughs. What do you want to get away from the little man.
