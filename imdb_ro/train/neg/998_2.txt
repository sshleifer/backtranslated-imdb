It's pretty bad when the generic movie has more information than the movie itself. The summary of the paragraph paragraph, written on the film page, has details I could not get from watching the real movie. I woke up constantly to see what details I lost, which could tell me what (bleep) is happening. Unfortunately, with no use - this film leaves some monstrous pieces of the story if you could tell a story. It's like trying to trick us into thinking there was some kind of movie here, filming enough to resemble the likeness of a story and leave the rest of our imagination. News Feeds to Creators: I paid to watch you make a movie. I can stay at home and imagine your plots and story lines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is a man I never paid enough attention to put my name in front and I can see why. She had one of the best performing fireworks I've ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I thought well, maybe she did not really want the role, she got a full offer money for a movie you did not see in? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, you do not book as lead if you can not act. If you really can, create a decent character for you to become. Also, somebody mentioned the white / latin problem - yes, I do not like to say, but this movie happens as an act of revenge against male men wearing baseball hats. This happens when there is nothing in the movie to dare the observer to Latin characters. The character Adrian seems to be a bastard who is no better than the story antagonist. As for the character of the Maya, she did not seem to be a true person. Anyway, I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was really done.
