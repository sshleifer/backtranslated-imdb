Ira Levin's Broadway divine comes to the screen, with almost no meat on his bones, a mysterious plot with only a few tricks and twists, but nobody deserves to care. Frustrated writer Michael Caine is crying to steal the work of a brilliant young man and divide him as his own; his unwavering plan may include killing a talented child who has Caine's married husband in her arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is terribly dead, and Caine does everything an actor can do to keep up the rhythm. Dyan Cannon is mistaken as his wife (he is too smart and intelligent to be passed as a ditz), and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems extremely uncomfortable as the best writer. These three characters, and Irene Worth's terrible neighbor, are so indefinite that what happens after the configuration has fallen back even after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is tiring and unclear, the design of the set unconvincing and poorly lit, and the end is a total disaster. The actors strive to give the script a substance, but with such a thin material, all we see is their laborious efforts. * 1/2 from ****
