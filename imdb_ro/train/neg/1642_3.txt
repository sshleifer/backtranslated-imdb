A few months before the release of this movie you saw it announced in all sorts of media, so I patiently waited for her video release to see what it was all about. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for the video camera for the last hour and a half to watch a movie so horrible. Essentially, it fails because it is a character-based movie about characters that can not be drawn. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only ransom quality is Amanda Peet) you can not stand anybody. The film is based on its dialogue, which is sophomorous, morose and brutal. The only funny character is Eric, whose portrayal of the only married member of a group of friends has died. The latest twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, inspires, in turn, the same resentment as Peet. All in all, just rent, if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
