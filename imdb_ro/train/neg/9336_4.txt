The "blaxploitation" murder project, which took place in the minus, turned directly to the black urban market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier plays the lead role of a nurse who becomes vigilant by a single woman after the bomb dealing with drugs make Coffy's sister a drug addict. Nonsense viruses bully, with energy and emotion preserved; only Grier's hot temper gives the story of a jolt (she is not an actress here but connects with the audience in a primal way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson did at this time, the film was marketed and promoted as cruel but still managed to find an audience inside the city. Today, however, it is just a footnote in the history of the film in the 1970s, and it does not have a large-scale attraction of other films of this genre. * 1/2 from ****
