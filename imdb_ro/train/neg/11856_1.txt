I just saw this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006, and it makes me very much wonder if fans at the festival will watch the movies before selecting them. The film was simply terrible - I say that without hyperbolic or hidden reasons - it was terrible. Matthew Modine's days as a leader are endangered. Gina Gershon brought an inexplicable and useless accent in English - she should be ashamed of participating in this film. Gloria Reuben had a little strange in her - she would also be ashamed. The script was terrible and we have absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I doubt this will be taken, but again, the people of Hollywood are known to sometimes make mistakes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious competitor for the worst movie I've ever seen.
