If you are looking to be offended or amused, or both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not even very thought-provoking beyond rechashing ordinary stupid cliches. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed that I was actually in a controversial mess. Beyond the thin gimmick premise, which attracted all the initial attention, first of all it is just another blade, an innocuous and antiseptic test of comments and entertainment that CBC usually excels in producing. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" hype welcomes its welcome, the show is likely to follow the ether of the annulment, because it is so superficial when it is judged only on the basis of its merits. If you are not obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or are slightly amused by the slightest idiosyncrasies on the subject. I really do not see how LMOTP is pleasing beyond the curiosity of the hype. Other issues have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multiethnic societies. LMOTP will never classify each other in terms of entertainment or understanding.
