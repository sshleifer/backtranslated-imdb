Pretty good stuff in movie B. Seriously, anyone who follows "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a bunch of people doing their first movie should know better than expecting real quality or even moderate intelligence. There are B movies to re-work the formulas that are popular. If you even give it a token analysis, you'll finish the movie for yourself (and maybe write something about IMDb). I liked the lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought it was particularly attractive. It was a memorable look for movie B. Unfortunately, I do not see where she made any movie ever since. I'll follow him again.
