No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book to the screen. While the movie is good and the performance is good, the dialogue that works well on reading is stupid when it comes to. Or, in other words, no one would be able to suggest that someone else's hearing was as if he had seen radially written on a pearl. Generally, the movie feels like a mistaken Cliffs Notes on the book - most of the parts have been hacked up to a fifth of their dimension in the book, historically and historically, and the end is different (and unpleasant) than that of the book . Most of the parcels in the book have been lost, including the one that makes sense at the end, and there is more than a reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" It's not a worthwhile effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned, and all the actors sent to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant extraordinary, but not even one of his own caliber could have made a decent film of such a complex book without doing a miniseries.
