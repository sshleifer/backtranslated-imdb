Blend exotic tropical locations, babes in T-shirts, explosions, Dudley Do-Right clones, a movie star with the best years ago (Martin Sheen), some martial arts and a ... I'm sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords ) and you think you'll be looking for some amusement. Not like this! This is a terrible television film, and although he likes to promote himself as a "Charlie's Angels" business, he is not as good as the original or even the most recent, irreparably bad, recent C.A. movies. This abomination is best described as THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris. Nowhere, as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some battle scenes are pretty decent. The girls spend too much time getting up and trying to look too superfluous and becoming annoying after a while. There is better gender stuff about it. Oh yeah, and "babes" are not as hot as they want to believe they are. Sound therapy ... when it's there.
