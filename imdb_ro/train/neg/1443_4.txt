Start with a good one: Swayze repeatedly speaks to Zulu for his friends, or that language is heard among the tribes. This is an extraordinary addition, as the US and UK film audiences usually think that all people on this planet speak English (only if you are one of them: no, no). "tenenkrommend", as we say in the Netherlands (makes your toes inclined - and not in a good way). I like Swayze, but that's terrible. The muscles in his jaws are doing extra hours and the whole film frowns-some have to tell him it looks a little weird. Not Patrick: it looks stupid and is a compensation for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for an acting style that does not match her colleagues' style. Her act is relaxed that this movie could have been set in the days. And it is not. You were just a clue, Alison. The best actor came from the people of the African continent and from Onyulo as Umbopa I liked the best. Warm, warm and in character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: It's mwah-fun on a rainy day. Mercy. It could have been better. Director's bag.
