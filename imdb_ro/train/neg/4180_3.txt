I chose this movie to replace the dissonant choice of television during the day and to go with my thirst for female females. Well, for the precedent, it's better than television during the day ... though I'm not sure how much. He has points, but after the first 20-30 minutes, he points out and comes to the conclusion that they are watching a television movie that has been put together with too little time to do something to keep together. In short, a terrific Sci-Fi movie. He has points like the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ... of course, this is not "Blade Runner." The captain looks, he feels like a kind of actor Robert Forster, the kind of person he would but unfortunately it ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda" rehash if the crew muscle is made up of bad children of intelligent aliens of "Aliens," the mystic is a vampire Willow intensified sexually, and the new captain could be the same as Jan-Michael Vincent running on the "Dangerous Island" in "Banana Splits," he just put the epauletal uniform, he has no right to do that. chains of force inside a ship that looks very much like "Eureka Maru" as it struggles with a class of "people" who occupy the universe and are scattered in several tribes or different sects the evolution of qualities ... like Nietzsche in "Andr omeda. "It could have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, someone has the feeling that he's been a hoot! Probably having fun, but it does not help much on the film. It's good". Okay in the way someone could watch the DVD once without stopping it; if they watch him with commercials, they will probably change the channel. You might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, you wonder what it was that made them look at everything. For me, that was fatal females. ............ when fighting.
