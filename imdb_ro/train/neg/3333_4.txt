Just like the early horror film The Boogens, the invisible unseen murderer is bad enough when he finally sees. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst was clearly entertained as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror. The father, extremely tired, has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) incapable of finding a hotel for the evening, so he willingly agrees to sit with a seemingly impressive museum curator, played exceptionally by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that boyfriend IL 'Sydney is a disturbed psychopath, so who knows what will happen to the lovely ladies. The three women are very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a clone of Helen Hunt) is the only one who wants nude because Sydney is looking at her to take a bath.
