This movie was a mess. It had the slightest absolute editing I've ever seen. It was almost at the end of a scene that the screenwriter wanted to go shopping, and the director added a second black screen to fulfill the dream of the writers. Under the dirty direction and editing, there was a brilliance of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere went wrong. The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of crimes. The first thing hard to face is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not ask him to be a good priest and he does quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the bad madman. Always plays a crazy madman. Very amazed. Oh, it occurred to me that maybe the offensive, horrible and disconnected plot is trying to add a sense of confusion that the character (Grieco) had lived. And just to prove it was controversial they rolled backwords credits. It's not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
