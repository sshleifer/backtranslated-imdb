After reading another review, I thought this movie would be good. I like the "B" movies, but this could not be classified as such. The photo is probably the only decent thing in the film. But editing left much to be desired. He was very agitated and staccato. Whoever chose the music and the sound did a great job. The music was terrible, especially atmospheric or scene. If it had been better, he could have taken the film. Unfortunately, I saw a better action in porn movies. If you want to see a vampire movie "B", check out the "blood ties". You will be much more distracted.
