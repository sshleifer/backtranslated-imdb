Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finished in the end watching this terrible movie! I wanted to turn it off in the first 10 minutes, but I figured I would give her a chance, because she just had to improve. Or at least some ransom qualities, as I thought at least that it would be a thought that would make you think of a movie type, or as really smart or very well filmed or something ... There is no need to I say it was not the case and I lost about an hour and a half of my life. I will not even worry about being terrible because it is a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down on the spoilers and pay more attention to the insurance the fact that people evaluating movies and commenting are not paid to write good reviews or somehow involved in the movie or anything like that. I thought it would be humor after this terrible movie will come to see the bad rating hoe would be and I was very shocked to see the ratings quite high ... all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly have to be about some completely different film ... Im still a big IMDb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no more than maaaybbbeee as a 3.
