*** Possible Spoilers *** When we saw this today we had some expectations, not too big, but not low. This was nothing like I expected at all, however, it seems to me that movie makers could not think about what kind of film to do. At the beginning of the movie is somewhat mysterious and exciting, but it will soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... As I looked closer I almost fell asleep a few times. The end is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splashing / comedy ... I'm not saying she does not have good scenes, it's just that the movie does not become "whole". <br /> <br /> 4/10 Filmul-Omul
