1993 was the year. It was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas had won an Oscar. Who knew I'd be extra in the movie with him? I was actually an extra paid in "The Back of My Boyfriend," which was shot in a suburb in Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thanks to God the producers had a heart change!) I was in the stage of the theater. I rushed to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters. It's more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to check it out. Nothing that's even close to "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead," but the cheese factor is pretty good. ciao
