I just had to write that line, but it really is. I like the genre of gangsters and this is the poorest entry I have seen in recent years. I have praise for all those involved in most aspects, except the most important scenario. It's a bad story about a little killer. No amount of fine or black and white film can compensate for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he's going to make another movie about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
