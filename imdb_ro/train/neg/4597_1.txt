After having endured this inappropriate film, I will recognize that it is a more modern story of the story than previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and it was made so politically correct that it made me mad after seeing it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, whom I thought would have probably been better expressed because Sam Houston gave love to the orator. I think Dennis Quaid (an actual Texan), self-absorbed, would have been a perfect Crockett and would certainly have been introduced into his starvation. Like a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mentality, I think Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan, even though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is, "It's not bravo if it's a fact," was done for Crockett. And the last scene at Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, must be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever did. even though this giant of a man and a fighter driven would have allowed himself to be alive is ridiculous Three different accounts of eyewitnesses place him dead among the dead bodies of twelve or more dead Mexican soldiers after a fight no doubt, hand-in-hand. Finally, that lame-man ends up with the San Jacinto Battle movie as a mutual battle between 600 soldiers and 700 Mexican soldiers, when it was actually closer to 1500 well-trained Mexicans Every Texas school that pays attention to their first class of Texas history knows that the battle took the Mexican army by surprise during the siesta , and the Mexican army was so confused that it could not form rows and ran because they were not trained to fight hand-held hand.
