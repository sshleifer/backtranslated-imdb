Do not be deceived, there is no horror, no movie. I strongly recommend that you not look at this 82-minute failure; the only reason he deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing is happening. Wait patiently for the hope that there might be a flicker of a twist, a surprise suggestion, a plot to get out - but not. Characters turn into irregular rhythms in their actions, and yet they do not have time to develop - thanks to economic publishers and shame writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful state (bring up the adolescent rock). The only thing that could have done worse would be to add the "comrade" of perishable ethnicity. Their encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are short, confusing and completely useless. > <br /> Chris Pine struggles to stay above the surface while drowning in a light casting misfortune. Lou Taylor Pucci could not be dry if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert. Watch "The Road," see the "28 Days After" watch but that; I beg you. He suffers from boredom, unlike the fact that he can be led to believe in the film, this film is not a treatment.
