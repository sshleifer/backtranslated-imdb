Bela Lugosi is a bad botanist who sends orchids poisoned by brides on their wedding day, steals her body into her fake ambulance, and gives her home so that her assistant removes her glandular juices to keep young Bela eternally young. Some secondary actors who play with the detectives are trying to solve the terrible and terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi does it well, but you realize she needs money. <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible and most actors would have been better to stay on the waiting tables, but the plot is awfully ridiculous. Tell somebody what's happening in her and they tend to laugh a lot and ask to see the movie. I took the DVD in a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a fairly accurate assessment, whoever pays more for this would not be in their minds.
