The black guy becomes a rich white guy, and a rich white guy seems to embrace the hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments in this movie play that. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost does not work. OK, so no one can expect Lance to get such a body and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I'll give that. But at the same time, it goes too far in the other direction. Should I imagine a rich white guy singing rap and everything uplifting, playing as if it were a bastion of hip-hop culture and people just accepting him? And about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white man *, even if he does not care about his money or his power? This is so completely unbelievable, it's not even funny. I could not stop the unbelief and could not finish the movie. I added an extra star because it makes me laugh even a few times. But I have not managed to get through the "white thing that makes hip hop", which has never been done in any movie I've ever seen try. There was no exception.
