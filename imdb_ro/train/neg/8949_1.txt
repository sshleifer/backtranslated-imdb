A few weeks ago I read the classic novel George Orwell, 1984. I was fascinated by this and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. When I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how she measured this adaptation. Unfortunately, the film has not even come close to creating ambience or developing the characters that Orwell has done so much in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie read the book because he does not try to prove why the characters act and feel like they do it. John Hurt, the lead actor, is full of the way, and barely acting until the end. We never really know what he is doing to live, or why his love affair is forbidden or what is the political climate and why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not be made right in cinematic form without a narrative and an adequate explanation of the political system that oppresses the characters, and their lack is the biggest drawback of this film. Besides, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking for about 15 years more than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to interpret. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the song was well chosen. It's too bad that they were put in a movie so horribly suited to the wrong driving actor. -Brian O.
