Many things become clear when we look at this film: 1) the act is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so, but the parent-child conflict is bordered by soap. The other two boys: a wonderful lovely child and your stereotype, I'm a babe, but I'm really sensuous inside the blonde dream-dreamers; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (Tom Hanks acts); 4) Inclusion of early love ballads is a weird choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) strange lines and side plots are no longer made by the terrible actor; and 5) this is a very bad movie. Wait to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
