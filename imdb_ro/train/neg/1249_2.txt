What disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, available technical resources and assembled talent. It is not the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to create in public the desired suspension of unbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible start that brought us to our arms, but then Mr. Burton forgets that his films have a working brain. Above Helena Bonham Carter's top libertarian, the lack of value of people's blockade, the ease of escape, the extraordinary abilities of the rider (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives who suddenly turn to a full inclination) the massive and immediate human rebellion, all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. He compares to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness completely captured his helplessness and stunning turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg retains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of leading and controlling in an inactive situation, and we never really ask ourselves about his welfare. Unlike Heston, he never seems to be in real danger. Tim Burton would have had to use part of the f / x budget for a competent script. Actually, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have ever bothered to pay fines for scriptwriters and directors. Let them go. The trained monkeys could have done as they did in the 2001 Planet of Waters. I bet that the repeated views of this effort will be non-existent. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination. Another lost opportunity.
