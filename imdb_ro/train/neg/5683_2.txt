Since the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like a movie about another Jason on Friday, 13. And it is ... Talk that the movie starts interesting. But, with the passage of time, his film has no purpose in killing, supernatural, silent in series. I mean, he's going under the guy's bed without making any sound that was not seen by anyone. He had to be blind after the failed execution, but he walks and kills people as usual. I `m tired of this. For me, everything is the same. In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. The good scene with the tide woman looked impressive, but only for the first time:} For this and for intriguing intro 2 stars.
