Perhaps it is the doubling of the film, or maybe the endless scenes of people weeping, groaning or wearing differently, but we found Europe as one of the most overburdened (and therefore annoying) movies we have ever seen. The film begins promisingly, if it is familiar, because Ms. Ingrid Bergman is too busy spending his time with his brave son, spoiled by a son (Sandro Franchina). While mummy and daddy (gentle Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at a party, the young man tries to commit suicide, putting in motion a series of life-changing events that finds that Bergman spends time with compassion for the poor and the needy . Delayed by Communist news editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she spends more time with the wretched than her husband, who soon blocks her in a crazy asylum for her problems. Bergman plays the holy part of her shoulders, riding her 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of illumination and filming in the best way. Unfortunately, the script loses its view at home with the subtlety of the ham-fist, as Andrea and Mom rotate, utterly speaking Marxism and Christianity. Through the final tear scene, we had more than filling these tiring characters. A true step down for Rossellini as he gave up on neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of the 1950s flowers of St. Francis.
