Someone will have to explain why every film that presents poor people and adopts a pseudo-stony look is somehow seen by some as "realistic." I have not seen anything realistic about the characters (though the actors have done everything they can with very bad parts) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "nervous", "stony" and "down and dirty." Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than just the camera without a rim or reason and they can not brighten the film to achieve any of the above qualities in a meaningful way. It's a sad commentary on the state of distribution of independent film that the only movies that see the inside of a movie theaters are now all carbon copies, with a bad cinema, a non-existent direction of the room and a lot of swearing that strives to pass "The art". No wonder films such as "In the bedroom" or - About Schmidt. I found them to be meandering and very common, but compared to the current clone of independent clones, such as "Raising the Vargas victor," they are all brilliant and inspired. A few years ago, seeing an "independent" movie means that you will probably be treated with originality and a lot of energy and care and maybe some technical problems caused by low budgets nowadays means there are chances to get yet a single figure, say - try the camera-around-for two hours of trying to taste the lack of taste of independent distributors. And, of course, all this to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived. Is it any surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer companies that have survived? It's not at all when you see movies such as Raising Victor Vargas who do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them.
