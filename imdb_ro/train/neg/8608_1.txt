This movie has two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. He also boasts Larry Miller always enjoyable in too small a part. Despite this, I found it almost undiscovered. Michelle Monaghan can be pretty, but she's almost free, and the reasons for Downey's obsession with her character are not at all understandable about the information the movie presents or the way it is presented. The end seems pretentious and although the intention seems to be that the audience should join the head and forget that the film, failing to bring us on the side of our protagonists, leaves us unwanted or unable to do so. <br /> <br /> The film fans say those who disagree simply "do not understand". I do not think so. The plot was not complicated or beyond the deal. It was simply unimportant and corrupt and obviously fabricated. Paddy Breathnach "I Am Lost," and "Snatch," and "Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Butoi" are much better examples of the film that director Shane Black fails to > I share a day of birth with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (especially as a screenwriter) makes me dissociate myself from any other connection.
