I could not, for my own life, follow, realize or understand the story. As the plan advances, it remains incomprehensible. I'll guess and say there was a pre-production story / problem that has never been solved. Producers can never separate many details about which the novel or any novel has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a movie about a serial killer and about the pursuit of the killer by the police. They ended up with too many things that happen in a time limit for the forbidden movie. Sin because they had a solid distribution, a director who knows how to move around things and excellent cinema. In fact, a well-done film that you can enjoy and relax for a few hours.
