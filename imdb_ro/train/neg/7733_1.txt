What a shame! I checked this in the hope that James Garner would be an undiscovered gem and what turned out to be a stinker! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undoubtedly blades and I can honestly say that they are just a few hours older and more weird now. The film did not really have redemption qualities, and if such things continue to emerge, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those who insist on knowing what it is, there is nothing, and in this case it is not a good thing. We're going to have to look for an old woman who is one of the foolish creatures ever to laugh on the ground, who happens to marry a real lover who is probably the only person in life who could have put her with her. She pulls him through one misery after another, takes him into an embarrassing situation after another, and boasts all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! It is not worth the time to watch it, so do a favor and jump over it, you will be glad to do it if you know how bad it really is.
