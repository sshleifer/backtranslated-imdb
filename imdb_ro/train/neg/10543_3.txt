The only thing that The First Power really has is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of his wonderful varieties of psychotic villains he has done so well over the past 25 years. Kober is a successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts of the fifties. But it's not enough, The First Power is a blow to blowing Lou Diamond Phillips lost as a LAPD detective who has a specialty in capturing serial killers. Kober is the last to catch, but Kober is in the league with a lower power and they want to join the team and make Lou's miserable life. Even after Kober received his gas chamber, his spirit returned to all sorts of characters. Mykelti Williamson is at hand as Lou's partner who encounters an ugly end involving a horse possessed by a demon and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a witch wisely around to help Lou. Will he manage to fight beyond the forces? Until the movie ends, you do not care. Lou really was caught in a turkey. Maybe the devil made him make this movie.
