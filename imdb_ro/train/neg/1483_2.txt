I just gave this horror comedy called horror comedy 2, because it features more famous porn stars of the past. A group of tourists, who are supposed to be on holiday in Ireland but actually in Canada, face an inbred cannibalist mutant or another, and the plot is more or less right from HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN. The only problem is, if I had not been confronted, it's just a mutant displayed, and it's not that impressive. A kind of mummy in that home movie five years ago. Some dirty but silly deaths help, but the movie is strictly amateur and boring night beyond belief. The end is foreseeable and was made to death. He did not want any money.
