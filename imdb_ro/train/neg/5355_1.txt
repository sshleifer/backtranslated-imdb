Now I do not like cheap movies. I do not see why you should lose money for a movie you could shoot with your father's video camera. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people who think it would be a good idea to waste a few MiniDV tapes. Maybe I hate so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the worst EVER plot, the most unrealistic EVER characters and indeed, indeed, MULTUMED SHOWDOWN in the history of EVER movies. Even Tom Savini can not save this. Seriously, this is a waste of time.
