We were looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's film, with great anticipation, after the string of hype and 6 Academy Awards. Unfortunately, it really is not a good movie. The representation of the situation seemed sure to be accurate and credible in all respects, but beyond that, the story happened to be incomplete, and the direction of the film seems to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors did a good effort, but for me I did not really get what the movie was trying to do. It's not as atmospheric and catching as the Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as an action packed like ... well, anything. I certainly can not see why he has been nominated so much, and why people "hike" to these epic proportions. Keep in mind, considering the size of movies in recent years, I think there is not much choice.
