I expected this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming it was more accurately presented than the movie "Christmas Box" based on Richard Paul Evans's book. We sent many emails to friends and family asking them to look at this show, hoping they would better understand a small part of my "new" life. After seeing the movie, I was so disappointed. As the mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really knowing the pain, I hoped that this film would leave the light to parents who "think" that they understand the pain that a parent who has lost a child goes through. This movie was a very heartfelt film, and Diane Keaton's feelings were a slap in front of the parents who buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from the start to stop. I had a few calls after the film, each one called the same, "That was so marked and made it look like in a short time you went back down the road and listening to songs on the radio and life came back." What a bunch of bulls! It is clear that director and Keaton have never lost a child, because none would have ever made the movie so unclear. I think it's Hollywood.
