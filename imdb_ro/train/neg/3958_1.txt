I will not waste too much time on this because, for my part, it's not really a movie at first, just a tiny movie with borrowing and amateur, embarrassing images made exclusively for the purpose of sticking all the misery together and call it a sequel to "Boogeyman." In fact, 80% of this movie is stolen by its superior predecessor, The Boogeyman, a film about which the writers of this garbage are not used to even looking, because they could not get the name of the original character of actress Suzanna Love (Lacy ) right. And to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original material and visible in the new material, apparently believing that their audience is as bad as it is. 0 out of 10 and I want the IMDb rating system to go to that lowest, painstaking and blatant attempt to break the people's money I've seen, You've been warned!
