OK ..... This is the third of the carnosaur series. Stay staying with dinosaur dolls! At the beginning of the movie, can not watch Dino's cause when it starts the number of frames you can see only the vision of Dino's eye, smart enough to hide evil puppets! and maybe 16 minutes before the film a special force squad with Scott Valentine as leader Rance, the team goes into the warehouse and then begin to find body parts and body after the Dino ravages, after a while a big box is coming up failing in the team and you you hear a velociraptor scream, quite creepy! and then a black girl goes ahead and now there's a blooper! A raptor's hand opens and cuts his face, but if you stop when the raptor's hand comes, you can see he's just a guy with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks have caused a truck, although they wash a few weapons there. 2. If the wrong dead happens it seems there are ten tons of raptor and a giant t-rex out there! How did t-Rex get there? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a blonde blonde girl told her to capture one of her life = (4. St. Jesui, the kidnappers have wheels in their deeds.) 5. Dino is now on a Pacific boat. t-rex had a strange thing on the neck hes ??? 7. END.Film is good if you want a good laugh.
