I borrowed this movie from the library, I think it could be delightful. How bad I am! It's such a stupid film that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this film she is not seductive at all, but I will have to witness her strange quest to seduce almost all the other major characters. It's so ridiculous. The dialogue of the film is so demanding and devoid of the humorous fact that then makes it acceptable. Total failure.
