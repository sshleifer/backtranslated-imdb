You are not sure why this movie was published as a wild, weird, laughing comedy. There is not much in this movie to have fun and not to amuse someone to shoot. Annette Bening (whose acting was presented as an Oscar worthy) comes here as a maneuver, with her seemingly routine performance. The character of Brian Cox is confusing and irritating, and the leadership of the Augusten game? Joseph Cross? seems to have no personality to play its part. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to support this boring, unpleasant film. The movie disappeared quickly and seems good reason. I have discovered some of the disagreeable scenes (the script with Brian Cox and his comrades used to review some of the worst scenes in "You and Me and Everybody We Know" and "Squid and the Whale"), some embarrassment and most they are disturbing. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Do not waste your time?
