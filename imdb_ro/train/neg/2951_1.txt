You do not see this movie if you cherish your mind. At the end of our collective view, I and my friends estimated that each of us lost 5% of our brains during the course. The only person involved in her accomplishment, who was not clinically crazy, was the stage designer. Most movies leave a bad taste in the mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of repulsion, this film has created deep hatred in me. I hate this movie very, very much. Some might say that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If she did not take it seriously. But no. The plot is a heated version of the Blade Runner-esque universe, combined with cheap rubber outfits so widespread in dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not just childish and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern, like Theodore Rex's voice, is like a nail on his soul. And if Juliet Landua, with her again, the British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft), as blustering commissioner, you sink into a growing sense of blur and disillusion. We recommend this film to anyone who wants to see the depth of stupidity to which humanity may fall.
