He saw this movie when he first came out in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated it! Easily, the most impressive movie I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh inspired, but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no moments of rescue in this movie, but only the long and long silence, with people unable to articulate what (perhaps) feeling is. If you want to watch something that will make you drink, then this is the one for you. If you have nothing to do better for two hours, put a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you get from this! Yes, Leigh has come up with a lot of really valuable things much later in his career, but give it a miss.
