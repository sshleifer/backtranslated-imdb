As long as I do not like to say "I" in response to other comments - it is quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with endless dirges that encompass the next 90. <br /> <br / > After being banned somewhere, the movie can not be watched. Just because it does not look like a Hollywood product, it does not make it credible. Worse, in addition to no discreet plot (otherwise than there are many places in the mud in Russia and many people, even very old, drink a lot of vodka) a number of visuals are so useless of nausea I'm in the second pack of rolls. As for spoilers - well, the movie is so deprived of any narrative narrative. I could not write one if I tried. Do not waste your time or money and do not confuse this with a good Russian cinema.
