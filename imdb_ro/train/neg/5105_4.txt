I think there are some there who remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl on TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles in the Head, and Who's the Chief? You perverse, you! Maybe you remember her at Baywatch when she grew up and got mammary implants. Regardless, you will surely forget about this alleged comedy about aliens who eat men. There are so many things that make no sense and are never explained. How did the stranger recognize? Why was the hot alien for boo and cinnamon? Why did the stranger not eat? Take the picture. Before the stranger can eat his friend and assume his identity, you can see it in Alex Meneses's body. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to follow this trash. Stay for your shower show and friend and continue with your business.
