I tried to finish this movie three times, but it's terrible for God. The point case: Mother and daughter head to bed and breakfast, mother stops for gas, strange crazy gas station on her madness, whose run B & B tries to rape her. She escapes, goes to the B & B and, instead of doing ballistic, wants to call the cops, the story continues with a warm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other logical deficits of action abound. The actor is also warm and the neighbor's warning is delivered at a very bad moment. Moments of intense gore / death unequally intertwined with teeming scenes of interplay between the characters in the meantime. <br /> <br /> Less emphasis on gore, more attention to mood and story would have been appreciated.
