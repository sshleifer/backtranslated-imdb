Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the photos are amazing and the material is dramatic. However, it was a great disappointment, and I was really upset at what Disney had done. Earth Planet BBC was one of the above and more. It was subtle. He had a general sense of balance and showed the whole circle of life and death. It was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's Earth Edition is nothing of all. They tried to make a movie about which Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put a top music score there to frighten us. They have done badly. They did evil WALRUSES. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be suspense and succeeded, but to the detriment of the equilibrium lesson. The film was an hour and a half negative portrait and only about 10 minutes of positive. I am for preventing the global alert, but this has been over political and environmental junk. <br /> <br /> This is another thing, I went to see him on the big screen, but he was disappointed with the image quality. Looks better on my TV at home. If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the Planet Earth series from the BBC. It's a better lesson, better sound and (if you have Blu-ray) better picture quality.
