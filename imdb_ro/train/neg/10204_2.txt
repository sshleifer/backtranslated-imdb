At first, the movie seemed to be great, it had set character profiles ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... however, as the movie progressed, it seemed to me that the director focused on hard things . .. or just a lot was edited from the movie. Character identities have changed more and more in the movie. It also seemed to have implicit meaning - in other words - they had things inside the movie that did not seem to match the movie. And the title ... not where the film matches the title of the movie ... I suppose the title works for predictions .... The actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have been better. But he did not. So now comes a terrible new movie coming out this Friday ... I do not waste my time or money.
