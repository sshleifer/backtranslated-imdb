The plot does not give new emotions, it even begins like the cube I. This time there are no other improvements for the cube machines, except for an extra exit that is not guarded, very ingenious. Characters are not as elaborate as in the first episode, but they have become "flat" as in soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone gets to the normal exit, that person will be asked some questions like "do you believe in god?", it is not creative or original, and especially in my opinion they do not fit in the mystery of the cube with traps. There really is nothing else to say about it.
