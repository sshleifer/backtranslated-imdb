A huge blow to launching with the Australian audience can be funny today, but the political flaw above her and the blond and unhappy humor can make it a little bit more. It's going too long; some of the content could have been saved for the continuation, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, who desperately needed new things anyway. Granted, the Australian ouster is amusing, but it also becomes annoying as the movie draws. Some say Crocker's songs are the best bit and are certainly original, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will descend as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything to make sure that overseas audiences do not see most Australians like Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
