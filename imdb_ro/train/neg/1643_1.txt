"Whipped" is one of the worst movies of all time. It's an average piece of ugly trash that made me stay in the theater more than any other 2000 film besides "The Grinch". It is not, as people call it, an insightful portrait of modern relationships. This would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While the film was honest and sympathetic, "Whipped" is a hostile, cynical, misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this as many plagues if you do not want to see how bad a "comedy" can be.
