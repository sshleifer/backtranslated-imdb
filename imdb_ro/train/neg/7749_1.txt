This movie should never have been done. From bad animation to worst action. I'm not sure at which point the people behind this movie said "Ok, look good! Let me do it!" I was scary of how dreadful this movie was. At one point, what might have been the best point, a Gold Sword computer fell from the roof that stabbed the idiot creature of cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the film was a paralyzed sabote who was killed in a few minutes after his first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before they are burned and shot. Then there is a casualty waiting for victims in the jungle ... that scares me for one reason. Will it be a Part Two? God, for the sake of people everywhere, I hope not. This movie was pure garbage. From the point of view of power point esquire, credits to image exposure end.
