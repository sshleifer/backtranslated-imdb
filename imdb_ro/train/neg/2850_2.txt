If I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have seen it. It is the deception of the Japanese, unhappy for Hollywood and embarrassing for any person who thinks. But then, most of John Wayne's movies are so. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved the Americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. The film deals with the isolationism of Japan in the nineteenth century. Perhaps Hollywood should be isolated. To make it as succinct as possible, this film is an offensive crime (a kind of Madama butterfly with bad music).
