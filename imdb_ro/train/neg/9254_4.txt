Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour faces the challenge of making a 1930s French music in vibrant colors. The opening vocation with delightful old titles was a pleasant touch. Then the camera aperture (such as old hand cranks) opens on a black and white card. The camera stops (or rather, up), suddenly shows the surprisingly bright colors of an elegant dinner party for a tea party. This is in the first 60 seconds. Then the music starts. A pretty banal and forgetful boy that contains a three-sided unbelieving choir that stutters some nonsense that have no relevance to the movie (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). These characters browse the door and are replaced by more people who enter a more forgetful melody. Then she leaves and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue in 15 minutes of film. I'm not sure what Resnais was thinking about starting with such a loss of time and musical cacophony. But the effect on the spectator is to make you want to cast on the screen and run out. I endured. It was not much better. I tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see our faces halfway (as Resnais seems too intentional to show the expensive landscapes to care for the people in front of the room). People sneak in and out of the scene, like moths around a lamp, and we audiences can not focus on a particular person or plot. It's like taking each episode of Brady Bunch and leaving it in a 2-hour movie. With the only songs. The only thing that kept me looking how I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at camera, lighting and landscape techniques, all of which I admit, excellent. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not I. Maybe tomorrow I'm trying to look at the end. Aw, who are joking. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you're doing it too. Get over it.
