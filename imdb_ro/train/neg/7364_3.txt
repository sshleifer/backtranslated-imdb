In 1692, Salem, a deceptive child's lie about the involvement of a slave in witchcraft, sends an entire community into a disorder. The costume with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not clogged, though it is not a vivid representation of contagious hysteria. Working with three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the story elements are quite interesting (especially since they left Hollywood in 1937), although anyone who has since read "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller, up melodrama the screen will not be tolerated for a very long time. The biggest problem with the image could happen in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a couple of lovers hindered by witch hunt, MacMurray being a far too contemporary presence for these surroundings. * 1/2 from ****
