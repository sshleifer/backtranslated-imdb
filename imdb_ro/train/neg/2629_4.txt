The empty point is a good movie worth half the rental price or if nothing else is in a good time without loss of thoughts. There are necessary explosions, hammocks and beautiful ladies. A fairly good distribution with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the wonderful Tia Carrere. This song plus a slight heart touch makes for a movie not a great but fun one .. on a scale from one to ten .. 4
