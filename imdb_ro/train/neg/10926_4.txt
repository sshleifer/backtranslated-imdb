While the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, execution is as usual lacking. While the mummy's practical effects are not bad, and the character "Gun Nut" is over the induction of top chicotel, the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the little screen. I guess that's been the idea over time. They do everything they can with what they have, but the moments "must see" for me were in the first 40 minutes or so, when Morena's character sported some Tomb Raider style pants. I do not know the high cinema, I know, but you can not deny true beauty when you see it! And Adam Baldwin does it again like the guy he likes to hate. If you want to watch only a few of your favorite Firefly characters, you have a good time with some materials under the hair, then this could be for you. If you want to act well and develop the character then we advise you to look elsewhere.
