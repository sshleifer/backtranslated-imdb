If you're watching this movie, you're either a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found it on the $ 4.99 Suncoast rack and you thought, "what do I have to lose?" Or you turned around the video store with your eyes closed and rent the first movie which his finger touches. This movie is hysterical bad. He has everything he needs in a terrible movie: a script that includes jaw-dropping dialogue and detracting detours in plotting, awful science that involves psyche and other dimensions, continuity that seems to travel through space and wormholes, actors which is not only wood, seems to cross the border with a free nudity (not everything that would necessarily demand it) and, of course, a 5 year old monster played by what I suppose is Fred Olen Ray's child. However, there is something that resembles the heart - as if Mickey & Judy decided to collect all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie (hey, my dad can direct her johnny's father's hardware store, and I know this ex-striptease that can act in it!). Look at the bloop bobber on credits - you get to know why the final cut of the movie was so weird. As a matter of fact, Biohazard II ... Alien Force also deserves a look, but they do not have the same delicious cook that he does.
