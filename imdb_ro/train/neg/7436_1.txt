This movie is a waste of time and money. Over the course of half an hour, I continued to wait for improvement and never did. It moved slowly, the plot went around, it was not scary or interesting, and it had nothing. Credits during the introduction were long and extracted, which was essentially the rest of the movie (long and drawn). Many parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the movie I thought I might have "zoned" because the disagreement of the plot, however, my companion had the same problem and made sure I did not "get out of the area" out of boredom but really was the movie. In fact, I have never posted here about a movie and I've been actively looking for IMDb movies for many years. So, taking the time to write something should talk about how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.
