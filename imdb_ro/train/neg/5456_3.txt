This is just one of those terrible movies you find on Lifetime TV that describe the abortive behavior of a disgusting woman in an empathic manner. Together with other such unpleasant films, such as "Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminality and tries to show the spectator why he is not a bad person. Give us a break! Here is my question about filming: If LeTourneau was a man and Vili was a 12 year old girl, would you have made a sympathetic and empathic image with this person? Answer: Hell no. Imagine the shift of genres into this movie, and then you will only see why me and others here consider this a piece of worthless garbage. If the genres were changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the killer. On the contrary, we should have been treated in a portrait of a monstrous and hideous man who lived a young girl, his lascivious behavior that landed him in prison and the brainwash victim suffering from the Stockholm syndrome. The only reason why LeTourneau does not benefit from the same treatment in this film is by virtue of his sex. Let's call a shovel a blow. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Simply. There are no buttons. He is a criminal who is part of the prison and deserves our disturbance and contempt, but certainly not mercy or empathy.
