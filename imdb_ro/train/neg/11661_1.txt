Basically, this is a prolonged, non-functioning action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed Wayans Scary Movie (1) and the sequel had moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even offer half laughs. <br /> <br /> Humor in him is absolutely brutal. If you like to beat, furting, stupid catch you should probably look at that. When it's not cruel, it's idiot. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave me everything, totally unhappy, just idiot. <br /> <br /> However, I've been following everything since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not have bothered). The story is undoubtedly thin, it was also in the scary movie, but at least the ladies were fast and steady. I think this is probably one of the main issues with this movie, the ladies do not come pretty fast. Some jokes are dragged too long when they are more disgusting than funny first. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells, avoid this. If you want a bad comedy with more laugh, then look at the scary movie, the plane, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 Completely unfunny, Thor storyline, A movie that seems to be based on an idea (ie if we were dressed like white puppies for a movie?), but they just did not have enough material.
