Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in an outdated apartment in New York and relies on his mother to help with renting. She has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who may or may not be married, but who will love Aldolpho playing the role in his film. When he unexpectedly receives a financial promise to finance his movie from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did. That's until Joe takes Al in an adventure to steal a Porsche for some of the financial support. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And, Angelica will play in the movie? This is, in the opinion of this spectator, a terrible film. The script is abisal, with a plot that wanders eagerly. Beals basically stutter all its lines, and Buscemi, though pleasant, is indisputable. There are a lot of disgusting and miserable characters to boot. Finally, production values ​​are also very low, also making the film look second at all times. If you have time on your hands, it is still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie. But if you're stupid to punish, let it go and see what's going on. Beals look nice, after all.
