A difficult movie to classify. He never gave me a concentration of 110% and, as a result, just as simple as the plot, I could not say with certainty who made what the American FBI characters and what role they were. I could not even take Irwins seriously as film characters, when their lines and scenes were all in the style of one of their shows, were not acted. It's nothing but a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show, with a sub-parcel largely insignificant, which just seemed to be hindered. However, since any show at Irwin always deserves a watch, this film also deserves a look, but not on Christmas Day. Speaking of it, I have better things to do than being here. A big 4/10
