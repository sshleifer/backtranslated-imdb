Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... well, two of my friends and I, I ordered Pizza, we sat down and I wanted to see something as cool as Ichi or the one a little brainless, but funny like Versus. But the Naked Blood sucks. It's a complete loss. Okay, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite remarkable. But that's it. Nothing more, nothing less. I will not vernalize the plot, others have already done it, I just wanted to stop the hype. But watch and miss for yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it could be. Another thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter has ever been - well, John is cool ... :) 2/10
