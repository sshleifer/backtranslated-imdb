I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After watching the film, when the writer / director and some members of the casting offered to answer the questions, no one could be bothered to ask anybody. Rarely has a movie so badly straightened (why on earth were random frames erased from some scenes?), He acted miserably (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional range from A to B. He park at A and bring a lunch) and totally useless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason, except forcing the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to a completely random and useless end that should "make you think". Unfortunately, what makes you think it's, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life, I'm never coming back".
