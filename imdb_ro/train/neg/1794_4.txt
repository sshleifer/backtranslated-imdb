not your typical vampire story, no brass stoker or rice anne here. a truly original story of vampires. these vampires are genetic mutants that are not disturbed by the sun. they are purely evil. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect. many actors are clearly amateur. the two drivers who play van helsing and the vampyre chicken rally are pretty good, though. the film is violently violent, which can bother some people. it is also loaded with scientific details that many will find it hard to understand and can get bored. I was sold on the intelligent stage and in the performance of the couple. without telling how successful this movie would be if it had a bigger budget and would be distributed massively
