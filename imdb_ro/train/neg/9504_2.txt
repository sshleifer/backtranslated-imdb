The only reason I watched this movie was that I recently read Robert Hough's film, which is less than perfect but interesting and fictional about the life of Mike Stark. Beaty appears as a character in the book, in a light less than flattering. I did not realize until I checked the movie later on IMDb that it was originally a serial. Anyone who repaired the original 233-minute running time to the 68th version available on DVD did a good job. The abridged version plays as well as any B movie of the period, despite many "duh-what?" moments. For example, are we really supposed to believe that our hero dug a twenty foot deep tiger trap one morning without making the dirt even dirty? Looking over the chapters, I see that the number five is called "Gorilla Warfare," and eleven is called "Gorilla". They were not gorillas in the movie. I think there were some cuts there. Interesting history.
