I agree with another commentator here, who was pleased with The Birds, won the Oscar in 2002 for "The Best Animated Short", not the sick material, which is the most pretentious and appealing to anyone, of course, faith in heaven or hell. The animation was good, but there are many animated shorts. And, by the way, I like dark humor, but this has not been appealing from the start. As for the story here: a guy who walks and is surrounded by something other than gray (the symbolism here) is told by a television (which appears every few hundred yards away) that he is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts a gun on his head and shoots after he has heard the news. I think it would be funny in two of the three cases.
