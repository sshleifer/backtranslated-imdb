Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. HERE. Now we know this movie will be very horrible. I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But I did not even think it would be so bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme ages (eventually), but, unlike Arnold, his films are just as good. Forget about this movie. You do not see him. Ever. I would not even have paid to see this movie. 1/5-star - a wonderful, action-packed walk in his heart. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketing would be sure we would think so, would not it?
