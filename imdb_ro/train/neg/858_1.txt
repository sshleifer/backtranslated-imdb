I hate this movie! It was nothing like the book, and I just think about it going crazy. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yes it is a good movie. But King's book was amazing and this movie was not like that. I mean, the general sense might be quite similar, but most aspects of the film are completely different. End of example! So the book is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this terrible movie version, the jack takes them into a stupid labyrinth ... yes, there is no labyrinth in the book and there is no reason for that. Another part that made me angry was that Jack just killed Mr. Halloran! what the hell he is, essentially, the hero of the book and killing him as if it were not important. Overall, it was bad that the movie was so far off.
