Shecky, is a goddamn legend of God, makes no mistake. Until recently I worked for a British HiFi & Video chain that led the testing department. We had to go through many new initiatives, it would be expected to learn how to come to find the various detritus that are turning out to be nonfunctional in one way or another in the shops. Now, to test testing the decision of these new staff members, we will release a copy of the Going Overboard. I had hundreds of copies of this movie because anytime someone who bought a special model of DVD player Goodmans who had this movie as a free gift, returned to send his DVD back, never managed to send Shecky back. Our new staff would have forced to use only the Going Overboard to test these cars for failures until they found a disc or two of them to test with. Now why the reason why this movie is so bad, where does it start? Adam Sandler, who can be as fun as Happy Gilmore or the Wedding Singer, must have a hell of a day. The rest of the crew died and what about Billy Zane? His name comes from some of the worst movies of all time and is a decent actor. Crazy. Production quality is absolutely zero. I would have been inclined to give this thing to scratch if I could, because they did not even have the courage to call her full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz" to release. Even so, it's worth a watch to see how far Sandler has come and how far he can go.
