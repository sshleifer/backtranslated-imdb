Pro: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: Everything <br /> <br /> Summary: A female reporter turns into a hitchhiker telling stories about the deaths of some people killed by zombies. > <br /> Review: Never in my life I have seen a movie as bad Zombie Chronicles. Filmed at a budget of about $ 20, TZC is a horrific horror film based on some dizzy, actors killed, who could not act to save their lives, and which were more brutal than frightening. How to make a movie like this? Simply put it, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. The last 2 cents: Very humorous, this film was made by a cinematic company called Films of Damage Brain. They have the brain were really damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it had been to me, this movie would get the negative bajillion rating)
