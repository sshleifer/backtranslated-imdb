It was a total disappointment. The actress is not bad, but the production was so bad that I sometimes felt the need to stop it, but unfortunately I did it and I was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor film. Is OK. if you are o.k. with moral plots and you do not mind watching a movie that mistakenly misinterprets Whitman. If you want a poor fictional story, go to him.
