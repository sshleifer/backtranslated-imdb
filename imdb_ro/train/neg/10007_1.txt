This movie is the best mediocre. Angie Harmon is as fun as a hammer bag. His emotion of "Law and Order" takes place in a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one who will be excited in this terrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to get out of this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. We hope this effort produces better results.
