A number of brides are mysteriously killed during the altar, and later their bodies are stolen on their way to the morgue. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate this mysterious murder. Discover that before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (assumed by the groom), containing a powerful drug that gave it away. Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a doctor, Lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting the groom in a suspended state and using his liquid to keep his wife eternally. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery that surrounds his wife), tries to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by setting up a fake marriage that leads Patricia in the mad doctor's claws. This movie had a very good opening coil, but in the end it came with too many cadre and other poor scenes. The distribution is decent, Walters and Coffin deserve better, but that's life. Russell steals the event (even if I do not give Lugos - who does not give one of the most memorable interpretations, even considering the monograms), as Countess Lorenz with the qualities of many stereotypical features of many of Hollywood's first donates acquis. Poor and controversial ends, too. Rating based on B, 4.
