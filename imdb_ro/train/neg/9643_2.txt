Under average movie with bad music, considering a music-based movie ??? Ordered script and bloody direction. Salman Khan was at his usual act. Ajay's performance deteriorates with time, while his looks, especially his styles like Steaua Rock, were pathetic. Asin was just a showpiece. I generally felt like I was wasting my money in cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many melodies in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song that impressed the music sponsor in the UK was the most impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be very easy to understand by an English music sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid," which was a simple and slow love story with a good direction and acting despite the usual music
