About 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material and because of its lack. They decided to fill in the free spaces where funny things should have been with so much language and utterly vulgar words as they could. When it left behind (very rarely), we would have sat back and followed (do not laugh, think) and wait for the following (gross) or offensive remark. After about 35 minutes, we both got up and left. Everything I read said how big that was. The trailer showed well and Roger Ebert actually called him "smart" and said it was not a gross comedic comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Together with Be Cool, it's the only movie I've ever taken ... and I do not regret it. I'm tired of trying to see comedies in America.
