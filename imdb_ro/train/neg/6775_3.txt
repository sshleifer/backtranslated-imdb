I was very excited to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a service-oriented comedy, director Stanley Donen, until now what she does not like? It's a kind of movie that asks me two things - when all those involved (including well-known names) realize that they have a turkey on their hands and what is the worst thing among them among the many aspects that oppose? I still think about the first one, but my vote for the second goes to the meandering story before the sometimes demanding scenario of the uncertain tone, the lack of coherent and well-developed characterization and the lack of relationship between the characters. You have to add a very unequal action to critics, but it is understandable that the actors were fighting these things and, in addition, they seem to be sub-rehearsed. Quite often they can not get their lines fast enough. Cary Grant tries to express her usual, charming and urban character, but sometimes seems insecure and staccato in delivering it. I have to say, however, that I was relieved when the initial suggestions of his character will be associated with vulgar vulgar Jayne Mansfield, who can not be said to disappear with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What do you like about the movie? - for me, mainly Parker's beauty that also acts with restraint and dignity similar to Grace Kelly. Generally, the movie is nice to look. Naval characters are very intelligent in their uniforms - however, you really need to ask Fu Manchu tunics, who do not meet them in their luxury apartment. Even Grant can not look elegant in his. Back to credit, Ray Walston has a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan Werner Klemperer's Heroes talk without a supposed German accent!
