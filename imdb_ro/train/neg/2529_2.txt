Bobby is a foolish kid who smiles too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to help with this search. The act is blades, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is just a chain of cheap crises and emotions. The filmmakers obviously wanted to capture some of the madness of other films of the time, but they have fallen over time. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, as this would add added comedic value. I'm trying to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito role - but he is just a supporting actor and there for clich√© value.
