The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a glamorous charm: it opens with the text in the Bible (the part Samuel Jackson recites to his victims in "Pulp Fiction"), and continues with two Karate schools in New York, fearing the eternal question of mankind (who's better, Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears, playing; he immediately stops a plane by hijacking and breaks a bottle in half with an empty hand. Unfortunately, any intentional or unintentional entertainment value is soon destroyed by the disjointed story, the lack of action for long periods, and the poor quality of any current action. To keep it simple, why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are no fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that are there are short and terribly filmed. Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is glorious. Just for them, they give "The Bodyguard" a second star out of 10. This movie makes it 87 minutes to feel like 5 hours.
