SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's about watching a short sketch on SNL is a bit nasty. Nothing like SNL is just a bad stupid thing. Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is just funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries the hardest and people think it's funny. Only fun in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was really fun with Andy was the pool side. It could have made the "silent place" much better if it did not make the scene falling for 3 minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he pronounces more H is retarded. They are trying to go with her for too long and half of it seems that Andy laughs while acting ... is a horrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. joke and it's for people with simple minds with a 10-year comedy level brain. Which is about half the United States.
