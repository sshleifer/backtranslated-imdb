There is no sun drop in "The Sunshine Boys," which makes the title of this supposedly ironic moment of Neil Simon's committing. Simon, who adapted the script in his play (which is not recognized), equates age advanced with irrational behavior - and, worse, left-handed, galumping, irrational moody behavior. Walter Matthau is ruthlessly starred by a veteran old age interpreter who has met with former comedian George Burns for a special television (they say they have been a team for 43 years, which puts the question " how long did it last? "). Burns, who won the Sports Oscar, has the misfortune to come to the film about thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already beaten the material in hell and back. The louder the film becomes less tolerable and more visible. Director Herbert Ross did a good job only when it was not coupled with one of Neil Simon's scenarios; Here, Ross sets up gangs as an amateur who crashes into belligerent routines that fail to pay (such as semi-incoherent Matthau, which appears at a mechanic's garage, at a hearing for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he compensated for the lack. It was up to Ross and Simon to alert the character, to give him the temper to give the Sun to the Sun some sun, but Walter continues to project as if we were deaf. The picture looks very rough and crawls along the spiritless rhythm; someone loses hope for this early. * 1/2 from ****
