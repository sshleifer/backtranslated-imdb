Maybe it's not fair, because we did it only halfway through the movie. One of the few movies I could not really see because of lame. The act is terrible, room work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example, during a coke deal, cocaine is simply weakened in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag. They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's the "sound" that crinkles and uses toy weapons with sound effects called.) The worst movie ever.
