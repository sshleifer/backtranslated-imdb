I remember when I was little when I was at the camp and I was in the field of the stars. There is always someone who has a good story to say he involved the forest that surrounded us, and they would always have come back. Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it in the hope that I would be one of those movies that had a supernatural being that haunts people in the forest, just like the stories that were told at the camp. Well, much to my astonishment, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is very bad. The story begins when a family of three leads to their winter booth, which looks like a suburban ordinary house and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and falls into a deer. Well, it seems that the locals have actually hunted this deer and are quite upset by our people. The film spends too much time following the daily activities of families, instead of reaching the point of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes, in fact, we have an action involving "wendigo". My suggestion is to stay away from this movie. He will let you want an hour and a half back.
