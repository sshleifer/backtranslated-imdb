OK, we did not have big expectations, but this movie went down into the depths that I could not imagine. The plot, such as it was, involved a priest of an obscure order of 2 members investigating the death of the founder of the order by a sinner. Guardian sin allow Catholics to obtain salvation outside the Church authority and is yet another immortal film with lots of ennui. Do not think that this has no meaning then a Baptist could give you salvation ... we will go further. I will plot the plot without giving too much: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to invest. He brings with him a mental patient (do that) who shot during a excorism and loves (not explained any of this lick BTW), an Irish priest drunk and Peter Weller as cardinal. They arrive in Rome are like children creepy do nothing in the film, meet with a robot S & M anti-pope that dr. Irish know (not explained) and providing information by killing people (oh, BTW, it's bad so it has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the story stretches. Heath storm sinner birds fly to New York, the sinner from sin a hunter and then other things happen and then (off camera), anti-Pope falls and the film ends. One hour in the movie somebody wonders if something happened. Eventually something happened, but you can be sure that the matter and since most of the drama takes place either before removal or off-scren, you feel really cheated.
