There were a lot of really horror movies produced in the seventies - but this movie is certainly not one of them! It is a shame The child is not better because it works from a decent idea that takes some horror themes sometimes successful. We have the idea of ​​a revenge child who worked so well in classic movies, like The Bad Seed, and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course was the backbone of many horror films. In fact, this happens: the little girl blames someone for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to take revenge (as you do). All this is good and good, except that it is boring! Nothing happens for most of the movie, and although it does not end up with a beautiful gore; not enough to finish the meeting with the rest. The movie was shot, obviously, in a budget because the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. I can not really say much about the film as a whole, because there is not much. The child is a terrible movie of seventy years and I certainly do not recommend it.
