This should be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever seen. (I could not see everything). Simply, free violence is just for her sake, and the ridiculous story line only adds to incompetent and insufficient filming. Sick. And only suitable for those with a love for manly mutilation. After killing hundreds of men, women and children, Seed is finally caught after the effortless murder of a few more police officers who finally have some advice about where they are. He is condemned to death by an electric chair and survives miraculously! Buried in life, he leaves his way and takes revenge on those who have left him and struck him. Needless to say, more giant crimes ...
