What a shame like Alan Clarke must be associated with this shit. This does not, however, exclude; takes a group of boys and some Stellas together and have a whale of time running this again and again and rolling on the floor in tears of laughter. Great things lost by night. House Al Hunter is in a well-published theme in the late 1980s - that the hooligans were well organized and not very interested in football itself - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent ???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors moving away from other lower-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or soon to go to the Eastenders, maybe for a nanosecond can do us to think it's a tough football the bullies is ridiculous. Did I really think that the ICF (which, of course, is based on the theater) would go to another city to fight just six blocks? ICF will remove subway stations and the like of SUTE. Andy Nicholls' scale must be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. The act is terrible and offers the most laugh - Oldman is so camp, it is unbelievable. Most of them look as if they should be in Mr. Bath's balloon. A true source of inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks he can make a move for that.
