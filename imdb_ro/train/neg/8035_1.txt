This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie and I'll rent any horror movie unless it's done for t.v. When looking at the box it says it's rated R for gore and some languages ​​... Where was the gore? Was it their only death scene where you actually saw the gorilla? I could have overlooked if there was a short nudity or a good dialogue. There was not even a spiritual line or fun fun in this sink film. Sometimes horror movies are great because I'm so stupid, but that was just sad.
