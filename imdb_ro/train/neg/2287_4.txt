I saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and you do not really remember him, but he did a great job as a naive girl who took pictures because he made people happy. She did not really believe what she was doing wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again. The photographs he made were certainly well-groomed by today's standards, and it is fun to see that men with cameras are very enthusiastic, and politicians pontificate the illusions of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, Good Luck) played a great role here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) has written and directed a remarkable biopic of the most famous pinup girls ever.
