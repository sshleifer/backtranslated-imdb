Honestly, this is easy in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. Partly because it's so serious, unlike ordinary light garbage, this movie wants you to be emotionally involved, feel the characters, and take care of the alleged conspiracy. None of these things are approaching even to happen. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) Incoherent and completely unobtrusive plot. 2.) Annoying MTV style troublesome camera. 3.) Moronical characters and plot holes <br /> <br /> Let me be elaborate. 1.) Apparently, when these films were made, they could not decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies, stigma or possessions. So guess what? They combined them! An aetheist becomes possessed by a dead person who then makes it exposed the stigma to expose a church conspiracy. As an ordinary person is capable of transcending death and possessing another human being through rosary, he is never explained or spoken. Now, instead of saying just what he wants to say, Stigmates give him. WHY? Why not just spit? Instead, we are treated in scenes of screaming things in tough voices, carving cryptic messages on cars and writing messages on the walls. It seems that this priest was also a violent type, because a young woman possessed also weighs one of the characters, speaking in that clear, harsh, "possessed" voice that I have heard many times. It also begins to bind to the second complaint, because whenever the lady holds the stigma, she defies the laws of gravity floating in the air and throws everything and everyone around her as if she were in a earthquake? Why is this happening? Who knows!?! I think the director thought it would seem "cool". 2.) This film contains dozens of photos, slowly moving, of course, birds that appear from nowhere and fly even the most annoying, dripping water. This woman's flat constantly supplies water! CONSTANT! Logically, the place will probably break up with many holes. To summarize this complaint, to the end, and for no reason at all, the room cuts at the drops of water dripping in slow motion in the opposite direction! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has nothing to do with anything, and once again I bet it's because the director thought it would seem "cool". 3.) One of the main characters says he has become a priest to explain holes in science. This does not make sense to me. I would think that reaching the church would be enough, but no, it must go through the rigid of becoming a priest. I just do not buy it. Secondly, there are plenty of plot holes, some of which you'll detail below. For beginners, when they receive the stigma for the first time, the scene ends with the unconscious, the bleeding. Then he's in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? The other is to the end, when the character of the "priest" mentioned above speaks with the spirit that possesses the face. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" It's not a word, but you have the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, no doubt!" So, because of that, he has an aetheist! An aetheist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then, is that the subject of the conspiracy film, this lost Gospel (of St Thomas, I believe) is available at local libraries. Characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you can go to a bookstore and buy it. Perhaps this should happen in an alternate story where it is not known, but the film never attempts to tell us this, or even suggest that it is an alternative event to discover this document. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is terrific in a spectacular degree. It is my archimedess, which feels the need to insult any chance I receive. Sorry. Final Grade: F
