It's a frightening parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, the amazing humor, as well as acting. But after all, it's a soft base movie that is expected and it does not matter because what you really want is sex. What makes me come into the biggest problem of all is hardly anything. What makes you feel like watching TV at 3am and independent movies are playing and the one on is made by a college kid who is not going anywhere in this industry. You left a lot of time waiting for a real sex scene, you often think something is going to happen, then you let it sit. The cell (maybe two or one with two parts) that actually goes somewhere is very enjoyable. I personally can not recommend this unless you found it in a clear deposit for one dollar or two. If luck for a good movie with a plot and good action, you do not want this. If you're looking for a good lesbian movie, you do not want that.
