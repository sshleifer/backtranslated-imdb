This movie is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. Surprisingly, how brilliant actors such as the two main characters in this film have agreed to act in such a peace without anything. The film is the kind of rape / beatings and revenge. The couple went to the party and hit a deer on the back road and came out to finish it when a jeep filled with bad boys came. He did not go to their car, but was hit and beat well while trying to run the car that betrayed her and she was raped. Then, in a way, she's in her father's home, and one of the bad guys is a neighbor, so she took a shotgun and wanted to kill him ... Scared that stupid! La Hollywood! He was against this vengeance, but "She was raped" "They laugh at her," so she has to kill everyone ... But once she got to the house, she was pleased to push the top of the boys into anus bad boys and gone while going crazy and running a bad guy. Personally, I think the director was out of money before finishing this because the movie ends before running anyone else involved in this rape and beating rape, which is not a big surprise, because the sponsor has obviously seen this thing and wanted to take his money back. LoL This movie is not really for those who enjoy rape because they will not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is to upset that this garbage peace has been done of the British cinema that I personally like and that is why I've been watching it. You do not do it yourself, you have better things to do this movie that follows the stupid scenario ...
