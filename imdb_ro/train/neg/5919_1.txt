I hired this movie yesterday, and I can hardly express my disappointment in the little Laura Ingalls because you got involved in something so badly produced. I'm not sure if it was horrible writing or a bad direction or both, but it leaves a spectator very disappointed with the fact that he missed the time to follow this. It consisted of a naive little story line, very bad lines, and relied only on beautiful landscapes and cute people to sell it. Unfortunately, this was not enough. It would be better to rent a static tape than to waste your time on these crap. Lindsey Wagner has also played a pretty pitiful part as a farm owner who apparently works very hard not to do anything, anyone who has ever been near a farm knows that this was clearly written by a young person in Los Angeles and not someone with a great knowledge of the world.
