I have read the book for a long time and I do not specifically remember the plot, but I remember that I liked it. Since I was sick on the couch, I thought it was a good idea and hey! It's a lifetime movie. The film is populated by actors and class B actresses. Female distribution is even from Disperate Housewives. I have not seen the show yet, but there are a lot of commercials for the show and I understand. Is not there anything original? Sure, but not for life. Male distribution is quite effeminate looking and acting, but girls must have assumed spouses. In a scene, a woman struggles with a man for her life, and what does she do? It hits him in the testicles. What else? Women love this, but let me tell you girls something ... It's not as easy as it has always been done to look. It was not bad. I've been cold for an hour or two, so I have to believe somebody with that.
