I remember Bo Derek's glory and British media attention (especially Sun & News world dolls) - all following his small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Obviously, a lot of agitation has been done to her photogenic image, her blue-crystalline eyes and her perfectly shaped breasts. Unfortunately, acting is, and has never been, her force! I think you should do one of the triple disc collections you always find in DVD coins - Orca, Tarzan Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for "So bad are great". He would be a guilty "must buy" of mine! If you have ever read your press or this comment, Mrs. Derek, please do not be offended - You have always had an unpleasant place for you and there are more important things happening in the world to worry than your ability to act.
