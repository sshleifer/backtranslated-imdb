I like the episode in which Jim becomes Greenman. Is awesome! When Jim throws that little person through the window, the face look is not invaluable. When she begins to address the priest in the name of her wife only to find out she has become Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting, together with an extraordinary adventure, make it visible. I'm trying to find some photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message, because I think Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim like Greenman? Can someone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?
