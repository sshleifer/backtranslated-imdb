This movie is really weird! I saw him as a 11-year-old and even then I thought he was ridiculous! I would recommend this film only to children under the age of 12. I did not really care about her, but I think she answers a few very good questions that kids need to know, such as: 1) buy happiness money? 2) Should I lie (my parents) about things I think they would not approve of? 3) Money buys friends? 4) Are the money all? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? I agree that these are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if the parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video to show / scare the children that lies have the potential to hurt you.
