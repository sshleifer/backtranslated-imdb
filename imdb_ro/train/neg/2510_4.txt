This TV film tells about extroverted Frannie who suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but not knowing of his mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but she plans to sell her and move away from her new husband. Frannie strongly opposes the idea and promises to keep the family's inheritance as it is, getting a job and maintaining responsibility. In a pleasant way, Ruben and the two fall in love soon (as you do) and from this point I have lost interest ... Farrah Fawcett is more than blonde hair and looks, she can imagine an extreme character convincing when he puts his mind to it - and it's certainly proven here, as well as some of his previous efforts, such as Extremities and Small Sacrifices - a tremendous performance from the legendary Angel of Charlie. Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never drives away from the cheap and cheerful TV picture and you know there's a budget limit, but it's not the worst movie ever made. Positive aspects are there; just find them.
