It could have been a fascinating morbid look at the life of one of America's most famous killers, but unfortunately it is not even approaching. Wicked editing, direction, bad action, you call it. This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched out in 100. The only quality of redemption is Bruce Davidson as a father, but that's not enough to save this stinker. A 1 out of 10.
