WOW! Why would anyone do a sequel to an already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. There is only the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is as follows: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where it could be a box filled with buried gold bricks. In prison, a riot bursts out among the riot prisoners, one of whom is shot by a guy named Cortez, and Cortez plans to come out. During the marriage visit, Twitch's fiancé and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and are kept in an execution hall. Burke is friends with Twitch and ends up in trouble with idiotic prisoners while he learns that Cortez has his loved ones. Opinion: This is the most useless sequel from Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the act is terrible, the dialogue is a joke, and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but that's no excuse for these guys not to make any effort in what they do. No one in this "movie" believes in the characters they play. No one in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself. His character "Twitch" is a backless minstrel doll who spends most of his time as he stands up for Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time in the film as if he had to do a doctorate (pretty big scene). Battle scenes are poorly pathetic and pathetic and for an action film HPD2 is pretty boring even when something happens! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is somewhat decent, weird and it's the first reason why people despise Folly Wood.
