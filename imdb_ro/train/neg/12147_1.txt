This is probably the most serious attempt at a Zombie movie I've ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the director, the filming family, or a friend of the director. How do you suck this movie? Count the paths ... the plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not get effects / gore, as I understand it is a low budget. But was there even a zombie that was not obese? Come on! And for a film set up in Rhode Island, why did this truck make a plate from Massachusetts? Go on, find some. The girl is dancing while the soldier "Stays in focus". Please do not put your girlfriend or boyfriend in your naked movie. It was an ugly film full of ugly people, and it does not even have a business that mentions Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, no.
