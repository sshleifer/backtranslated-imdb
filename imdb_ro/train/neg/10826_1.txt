I can not say that this is the worst movie of all time, but only because there are still some movies I have not seen yet! This must be the most pretentious attempt to make a movie of all time! The director suffers from the same problems he has had with "There Will Be Blood" (though it was not that bad in the movie). The whole movie feels you're looking at a guy who's trying to impress beyond his skills. It's like sitting in the director's chair and thinking "how would a great director do this scene?" He does not have it, I do not know if this movie could be saved by a great director. surely some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to crystallize The scene in which all the characters sing was the worst moment in the history of cinema One by one when we see the characters singing and I sneaked in my chair, I always said, "Please, DO NOT, stop the guy from singing to death, too!" Sure enough, FAILURE MASSIVE!
