: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with the Joy of Breaking Love. I've waited a long time to see her and I finally managed to resume Hallmark on Thursday night. I like the first three movies "Love", but it was nothing like I thought it would be. The entire movie was sad and depressing, there were many chances of appearing, and editing was very poor - at many scenes outside the context. I also think Kathy's child's death was coming soon and Clarks' appearance in the movie did not seem to fit. It seemed that none of the actors wanted to be there - all of them had no emotions. There was no interaction between Missie and Willie. I think the screenwriters should have gone more than a book. It seems like any movie that has been done so far is just slipping ever closer to Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the film they did not mention anything about the mine and the two boys or Clark being injured because of that. And I think Missie and Willies' reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. Of the four films I have made so far, I have to say that Joy is the least favorite. I hope the next four movies are followed by more of the book and if the character of Clarks is in them I hope he has a bigger part and I hope his side is not so gentle. I also hope that there is more to Scottie and Cookie and maybe even to Marty, but who knows what writers of scenarios will have in the next store.
