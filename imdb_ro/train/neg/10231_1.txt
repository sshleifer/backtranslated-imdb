Honestly, I'm rather thrilled that, based on the blinking reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I've lost almost two hours on my debut offer. Have all been written by his friends? Action is gathering over time, music is irritating and used, the script is simply terrible, and actors (except the gardener) are mediocre at best. I think we should support the efforts of a young director, but we say he is brilliant when he does not encourage him to make the same mistakes, that is, continue to write his own scenarios and use the same actors for another business. Yes, it's his first film, a low budget, etc. - I understand, but it's also there for the public to buy and it's not enough to zero.
