Those strange people who live in a city are giving their lives. There is a licker a licking guy, a diver who finds a body he takes home to live with, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean the girls of their evil ways ... in Finally, this black and white movie is better with color. The monochrome has the edge on the two steps of the home movie sensation. As a Troma movie, this movie is fun in fits and starts, but mostly strange to the weird sake and soon becomes a bored crash because one you see set ups can guess where they go a lot of time - not always - but enough not to be fun (although I did not see the cleansing coming). It's worth a shot if you have nothing else to watch and wait for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.
