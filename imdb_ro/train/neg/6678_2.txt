This is a copy of the classic "Doris Day" of 1948, romance in the high seas. The story line is more or less the same, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp man who replaces his husband on the journey. While Rani plays the college boyfriend of his wife doing the same favor. They try to catch each other while their husband and wife are trying to travel to each other in Bombay. During the trip, Govinda is wronging another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spying on her while falling in love with Rani Rani. Lever plays a double role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are against each other for the fighting couple. It's a poor copying attempt on the original classics, and the songs are pretty scary. Comedy is a slap and does not make you laugh too much.
