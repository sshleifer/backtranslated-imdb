Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was delighted when I bought my Syriana ticket. When I saw the trailer and I was a thriller lover, I was expecting to see a movie that is moving fast, with the soul collapsing wisely in developing global politics and in the relationship between oil, power and corruption, fresh angle. I almost left the movie in the middle. The rhythm was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, the interconnected editing made the understanding of the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you do not care. Save your money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
