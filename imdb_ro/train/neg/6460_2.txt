Can anybody tell me where is comedy? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very poor comic, (Thomas Haden's Church looks so weak (with him!), and everything is so rude! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a comic book that turned out to be a super-bloody nightmare and it was not even funny? Like the scene in the bathroom, it was so good with cinematic imagination, but there's nothing but PAIN Donald Sutherland's relationship with his daughter! * This is actually a kind of work that they just did to make it and earn some money from it, but become such a crime when this money is robbed of us those who have been deceived by such a low art work and entertainment has absolutely no entertainment AT ALL! Well, it would have been uglier if it was a big production and with Brando golden years with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Just be aware of Whoever was discovered to admire this movie or -God-Love her loving it! Then you have to go straight to the therapy before it becomes more dangerous and hurt someone else! Brando is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he did not intend to be one here, after reading this safe! But the main major problem is that no one else has ever worked in this, trying or wanting to be a little smart or even good time! (I'm sorry I'm crying now! Torturing the movie is unbelievable!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hitting (Mira Sorvino) of her shoes! He was so realistic! Maybe she can see her, so she punished her because she was in such stupidity! <br /> <br /> * For billions of years: It could have been better (or less bad!). The scenario, until the wreck of the train, was beautiful, and I just imagined they would escape to have another hunt (Smokey and Bandit), but (Brando) as a sheriff. In fact, any of these chimeras was very merciful than what we have been following! Why did not this masterpiece receive a Razzie Award? You want to make me think there was a smaller film than HERE? I do not think so ! It is a situation in which Razzie's supervisor must win one himself for his negligence! Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star, perhaps for supporting his son of failure, but ironically, the father was just as failing as his son! why, please? Good ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hated that comic movies were not as ambitious! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO. It's a horror movie! I just hate horror movies, especially those that have been propagated as being comic! <br /> <br /> * Name a good thing about it? Hmmm! Well, this film compared to Marlon Brando's other monster film (Dr. Moreau's Island - 1996) would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what they are or what are the bad ones, the ugly and very ugly in this movie .. Pray your last prayer and go to watch it .. May God Help You!
