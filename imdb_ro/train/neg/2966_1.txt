I can not understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap spitting, you will enjoy this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not look at it. Personally I did not like the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired directly from the street. Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what's next. The overall quality of this movie does not have a very low budget. When I saw this movie (I and three other people) I had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do so just to get their graduation from a film school - with the lowest effort. Another problem that really diminishes the whole experience is a little bad (very agitated) and bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recognized with only one microphone.
