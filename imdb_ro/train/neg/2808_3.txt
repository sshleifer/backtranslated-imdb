A distribution of the 1980 TV movie and TV series stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel, among others) in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course, models and other people are starting to return to death, causing all sorts of complications. Over the thriller was not very good and has enough nudity and violence to get a rating R, but not good enough to generate any real interest. This is best described as a kind of film that gave the Cinemax cable channel the alternate name of Skinamax. I really can not see the point of watching this if you do not have to see every crazy thriller out there. (I also have to tell you that this movie is full of smoking, to the point of becoming ridiculous when someone lights up)
