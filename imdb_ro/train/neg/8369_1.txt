Since this image is classified as a "pure entertainment" activity and because there are already many comments about it, I would like to address here something relevant to humor abuse. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the role of joker in this movie. Of course, as long as he has been involved in casting, he has always acted as a small man - an actor can change his usual dress, but he can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter may be an advantage when needed . Far from what I expected, I saw a very disgusting picture, claiming to have revealed various aspects of the child's life in error by a forty-year-old killer. And with a happy and happy ending. So what's the reason? Many elements are mixed, some of which are violence, sex and criminal activities, including the story being mistaken and, to a certain extent, lacking common sense: Where is Vanessa when her home peace is violated and her husband's life is being pursued? In addition, the diamond is even higher than the world's number 1 Cullinan! But the most aggressive aspect is the continual attempt to make the little man superman, pointing to his weak physical points. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, rough and fragile; it can not be cut off with any other material, but only conquered by the warm blood of a male goat. Therefore, it is no longer a diamond, but pieces of scrap.
