Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine it at a friend's dinner party and add a comment to the in-depth political debate. People look at her and say, "Oh, what did you know, you were the star of" Theodore Rex "?" How could one take it seriously after it has descended to be the star of this strange piece of nonsense? Even young children would be embarrassed to this. He reminded me of a particularly bad episode of "Sigmund monsters and the sea". In fact, think about it, "Sigmund" was far superior to this. And yet it was done? Making the manufacturer with an illegal substance before telling him about it? Watch this hideous abomination at your own danger.
