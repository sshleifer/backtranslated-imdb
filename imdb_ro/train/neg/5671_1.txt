If you like to see the animals are skinned alive, their heads crushed, the throats of dogs crushed the men I stomped, then it is for you! But if you are somewhat normal and you do not have to see real images of animal cruelty, pass it on. This movie tries to shock the viewer and certainly does. With the smash of animals from the beginning and killing children in the film (at least fake), it was enough to disable me. I've seen movies like this before that showbiz movie (BTK) and this kind of material should not be allowed in a horror movie. We're watching gore and horror because we only know makeup and special effects, so we do not have to sit down watching a movie and see the real killing of the animals, not for what we rented the movie. If there is anything, there should be a high warning label placed on these types of garbage so that people win, not be surprised by it. Like a very heavy horror fan, he turned my stomach back. The entire cast of film and crew need their checked heads.
