Whale hunters choose the wrong whale. A group of whale exploiters yahoo catches a woman and plucks her through her tail. The dragon's couple sees everything, including when the fetal child's child slips and bends down the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) might say that the big man is crazy about how he looked at him as if he said, "Get out of town before the tide." <br /> <br /> This vengeance story has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not something else. This was Bo's first "released" film, although his first role was four years in the movie "And Once upon a Love" released in 1981 under the name "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). Today, the date of this review (November 20), is the birthday of Bo Derek. I hope Bo has a "whale" of a good moment ..... to get it? ..... balena? ..... hee-hee.
