Unfortunately, I have to agree with the halopi critic. For a short feature, cinema, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else are very, very good. This may seem surprising at first, but I was told that the technical crew working in this area was professional, so quality is expected. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. The thing is, it's not a story. To tell a story (or in the case of a movie, show a story) you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason can not get it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that respects humanity. That's right. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of telling a story, we just learn things about this guy in Tim Watcher. Of course, given Tim Watcher's special nature and the short duration of the film, it's hard to get enough background about him so the movie will turn to Narration Voice-Over. In this case, it is used in the worst possible sense, which is to provide information that we would otherwise have never found. In fact, if it was not for VO, we think the character was just an old man looking around at things. To make it worse, VO also explains what's going on on the screen! The pictures we show are just decorations for the text we are listening to. We could say that this short film would make a good movie for a band or something, but because the pictures do not - They're not on their own, it's impossible to say that. What remains of course is value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew (not incredible but good), but fails to entertain, to amuse, to tremble, or at least to show a story.
