This movie is a good example of how, by manipulating the media, you can sell a movie that is just a very dysfunctional television sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the most widely circulated daily newspaper has continuously written about the wonderful achievements of this film, almost silencing all the others. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. CLARIDAD weekly is the only newspaper on the island that analyzed the shape and content of the film and highlighted all its flaws, clich√©s and bad writing. Just because a movie makes part of the audience laughs with simple and obvious jokes, and because it recognizes the actors and the landscape, does not make it an acceptable film.
