If you touch your head with a shovel, write the scenario with your feet, you can get closer to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster movies and has done much better. Those who think Scarface was a kind of hero who had to watch or see "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead President" and thought MMM "That's Life for Me!" you will love this movie. I thought I'd give the movie a chance because the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs. Anyone above a class IV education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be pleased.
