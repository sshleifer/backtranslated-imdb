This film differs from the "wonders of the human body", naturally carried out with bizarre courage, which lead to disgust for the spectator. In one scene, the camera closes on a huge 50-foot zigzag as a teen pulls pus and fluid out of it. In another room, the room is semi-submerged in a half digested swamp and stomach acid as part of a pasta salad falling from the esophagus and poplar in the goo. In a final force tournament, the camera takes the spectator in a rough walk through a hairpin ... Unfortunately, I do not do anything about it. See this movie if you have to, but: bring the sack to the vomit and you do not have pasta salad in advance.
