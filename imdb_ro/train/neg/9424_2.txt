It was not good to look. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets an ordinary job (boring!). Just like his cello son can go to the shooting school, but his stepfather decides he will instead make a humiliating document about a man. A documentary film should direct the camera and simply shoot, do not manipulate and comment with subtitles. The director's bitterness and resentment towards his stepfather is obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank look stupid and pathetic, but he meets as the most humane of the three people presented. In essence, a smear campaign, all dressed as something smarter and more edgy than it really is. He left me an intense unease for the director of the film.
