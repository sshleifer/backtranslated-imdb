Canadians are too polite, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival has left the theater, mumble that they will miss this 0 or 1 movie on their ballot papers. The premise is that a modern director interprets a 17th-century fable about the love of pastors and shepherds established in the distant past, when the druids were spiritual leaders. The work in three epochs has many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including silly and impractical clothing and special spiritual rituals involving very poor poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross confrontations and assorted phrasal situations occur. The movie could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece that looks very much, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience laughed at the jokes about sight, but otherwise it went mad at the slow pace. The end comes in a hurry and it is really terrible. This is a trivial film and a loss during the movie.
