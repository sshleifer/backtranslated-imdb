Man To Man hardly tries to be a good movie: has the heart in the right place, aspires to be epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. But there are some of the problems of this image. She strives so much to be good and to receive her message in that sometimes the viewer must feel uncontested. So, it is enough that the images that are used by this image are simplistic - The Man of Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but crashes the message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: doing everything he can to look worried, truly moved and all the other emotions you can express with the facial expression of his repertoire. Add that the movie is too long and loses its speed at the end of which you would have easily led to the conclusion that Man Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it's fun, it has humorous scenes and Kristin Scott Thomas show theft. Of course you should not compare it with humanistic masterpieces such as "The Elephant Man" (David Lynch), but you will leave the crowded theater. Try to get your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and manages most of the time.
