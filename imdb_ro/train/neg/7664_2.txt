Spoilers before, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a full movie review of all the questions? Could it be that? Why buried an ancient civilization artifacts around the world? Why did he never answer this question? Why was the inaccurate crawl opening text? Why would she be a nun (which she really looked beautiful!) To give more orphans a madman? Has it always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why one of the gold mine wells comes out in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does suddenly Tara Reid's character appear to Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I only answer my own question?) Why could even a non-archeologist bang open a solid, worthwhile gold chest with a barometer? Why would the modern computers continue to pre-Tron green screens of objects, supplemented with small "sounds"? And all the explosive timers of the movie must have digital displays? Why Nothing in the movie makes sense?
