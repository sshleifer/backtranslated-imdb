Poor parcel, inappropriate operation of the machine, and helpless characters. At first I thought this movie was made in the seventies, because the quality of the picture, as well as the story and drama, seemed to be taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made up to -97 I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst and fewest movies I've ever seen. If you read this, we advise you, if you see it, you miss the time when you could have done something more interesting, like watching the dry painting.
