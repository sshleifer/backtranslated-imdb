This movie is very bad, with a scenario full of "memorable" lines and incredibly bad shows. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen), and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it. Only two short themes (about 30 seconds) are repeated constantly throughout the movie. All this, one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
