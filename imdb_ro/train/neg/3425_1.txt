I will spend more time on this review as script writers. This is easily the biggest ever EVER done. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's show GOD-AWFUL, so it was everyone! Physical comedy was forced, paid and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by Mongolian monkeys using the names of Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. The way the producers have managed to squeeze out such cinematic debris are above me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talented buff. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. I want in 96 minutes of my life to look at this remembrance of a brilliant comedy, to try to condemn everyone involved in this cinematic atrocity.
