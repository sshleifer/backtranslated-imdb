This version of Moby Dick insults the audience, claiming it is based on Melville's novel, even if it is a phrase in the first chapter, than the famous Call me Ishmael. Apart from the fact that the actor had a terrible adventure, even from John Barrymore, this is probably the best example that Hollywood (especially at the beginning of Hollywood) could revise and change a famous novel just to show off, and improve your box office chances. the novel has been completely eradicated, and Ahab has been changed from a blasphemous, obsessive madman to a dear and erroneous hero who wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance (!) returns from him after he he saw his leg. To this is added the evil standard brother who wants the fiance for himself, and another end is over!
