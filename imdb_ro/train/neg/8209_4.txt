The actor, despite other opinions, was remarkably well done. Brad Pitt does quite well with the role of an annoying and unpleasant climber. Another action is fine. The story might have been ripped off, but somehow lost her - she really does not understand or care about the characters she presented, so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to attract this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and cinematic landscapes, a remarkably dramatic story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but we could not try as I could get involved in this story. As a fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected him to love this movie - and yet he let me go cold. but I tend to look at the creative end of this film - direction, script, production, editing - somehow lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful. Good action, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It was not. It's probably worth looking, just to make your own mind - but do not expect too much and maybe you will not be as disappointed as me. For the most part, I was bored.
