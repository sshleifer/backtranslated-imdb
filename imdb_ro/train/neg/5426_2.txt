- In the tradition of "Carrie" and "Heathers"? Try "a shameless revolt of these two films, but also" Evil Dead "and" The Shining. " That being said, they really do not make bad horror films like this one, and that's a shame because it's a gas. <br /> <br /> Rainbow Harvest is Winona's replacement here, and although she barely makes her mumble (and from time to time yells, "You're ugly!" in her haunted mirror), she's Goth before to be fashionable, so you have to respect it. (And she's pretty creative about her too, accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black spray-painted Hawaiian-Punch-type hat. Eat your heart, Cher.) Karen Black overacts a gift but is not totally unpunished and you can not help with it. (If you are not a certain friend of mine who asked, `Who is that, the lips of horses from 'MASH'?" First time it came to the screen.) <br /> <br /> There are performances Decent support by Kristin Dattilo (like the square queer who is fond of Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his sarcastic role as trademark), and William 'Larry, Darryl and Darryl' Sanderson (as a kind of funeral animals company, or something). But it's sad to see Smokin 'Yvonne DeCarlo once reduced to playing what can only be thought of as Charlotte Rae's part. <br /> <br /> Eighty were the glory period for horror films, bad-minding mindbogglingly like that, and "Mirror, Mirror" was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.
