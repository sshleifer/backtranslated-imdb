This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I have ever seen. And I am very amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as the other films) are different. It also lacks a very important problem: Resurrection. None of the other films goes beyond this very important part: the faith of all Christians is right in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is vain." A very impressive scene for me in this film was to see on the streets the remains of the palms used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus IS NOT a myth. And, by the way, he was a JEW. There are a lot of documents (expensive and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say God to become a man) that really changed mankind. I strongly recommend (since he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the brightest Jewish commentator of the first. Century.
