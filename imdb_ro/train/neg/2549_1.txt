my friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (it does not even have 1 cent in value), because they wrote that it is like American pie. but soon we find out that there is a long way from American pie to that piece of nonsense. it's not even a comedy, it's really a really bad documentary. not only the story is bad, the image and the sound is also shit. they put some drunk alcohol, chicks, dwarves and teens. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie you do not buy it, rather you spend your money on something else and better. if you get tortured, then do not invite your friend / s, unless you hate it very much and want to get rid of them.
