If you want to make such a movie, it threatens to be real. Do not surround yourself with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and unbelievable. The actor is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Well, at some point, he must confront music and fight crazy. I do not care. You? All these long scenes are set in this austere office (cardboard or masonite furniture). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's over. Not disturb.
