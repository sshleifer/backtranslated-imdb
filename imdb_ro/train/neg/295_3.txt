I took the movie because I worked at a movie store so I got free rents. It came in and the lid made it look good. Hot chick, wearing a gun, okay, I'll check. Dude, move it bad. It was so horrible, I spent half of the movie watching fast before I got to nudity, which was minimal. I think there may be three scenes of partial nudity. Dialogue with cheeses, bad violence, poor excuses of characters. I feel stupid to put this movie down, because I know it was made for a cheap budget, but it was "Clerks" and it became a classic cult and a franchise.
