I just watched this movie last night and I wanted to put a warning on someone else who wants to see this movie. In a word - no. I feel really serious about something that a screenwriter student wrote in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, that is, every word was a cursed word. I have no problem with the deep curse as in "Hunting Goodness", provided it helps to enslave more into the characters. In this case, it was just an attempt to try to attract a breathing or a laughing occasion from the audience. The three main characters are all their unique stereotypes, street jerks, cocks, and "not gay," "easy-to-touch-with-feminine-side". You just do not care about anyone! They're all lousy little deep, you do not want to see, you want to see lost. For those who dare, this movie has some funny moments, just the beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a rather sick "Uh, yes" way. Indeed, I would recommend this film to the worst enemies.
