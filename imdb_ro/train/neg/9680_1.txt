Greenaway seems to have a habit of deliberately trying to disfigure the viewers. This film opens with incest - and intentionally, meaningless, incest casual to this. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers salon tricks to actually shock, to do something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. It's just a little perverse for the sake of perversity.
