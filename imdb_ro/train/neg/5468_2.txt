I admire the worship of the Toxic Avenger series, but this poor offer of the Troma people made no sense and I burst all the time. A dripping nuclear plant (and the growing weeds beside it) make the young people in Tromaville High Nuts, which makes them join a gang, have sex, explode and anything else. There is also a kind of reproduction monster in high school ... God, this movie is a mess. The actors have ceased their efforts after that and should. (The smell) began to get my nerves in about 5 minutes ... Dissappointing. 2/10.
