Do you remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest Hollywood star for making great movies? These days they feel like an ever more distant memory. While Hollywood Hollywood is not terribly terrible, it's a routine and surprisingly boring movie of a cop. It's a comedy that is not particularly funny and an action movie that is not particularly interesting. An overlap of subplots can not mask the weakest of the central story. At least it seems that Ford enjoys himself more than his latest projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is appropriate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. Everything, "Hollywood Hollywood" is a rather funny diversion, but it's barely. Get Ford out, and that's not it.
