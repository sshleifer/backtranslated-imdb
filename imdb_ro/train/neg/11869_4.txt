I do not know if the problem I had with this movie is that I have not been able to capture the way in which movies have been made in the past, but I think it did not fail to make use of any of the fashionable conventions available in the 1940s for make a movie. If you do not have something better to do, my advice is not to look at this movie, but to read a book or go for a walk.
