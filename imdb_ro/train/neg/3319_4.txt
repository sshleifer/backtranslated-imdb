I was surprised when I saw this movie. I hear it was the best film of the novel. What a disappointment I was. As any true fan of Jane Austen can evaluate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The writers decided to stay in pieces of ridiculous humor that are embarrassing in the best moments, but also ruin the sensation of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a pretty shallow heroine (but then any hot American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor is made ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really could not say a good thing about this movie. Looks like I'm among the few who do not vote, but if you want my advice, see the television production with Kate Beckinsale instead - believe me, it's more preferable to this surface trash.
