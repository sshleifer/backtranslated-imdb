I realize that it should not be BSG and I can handle shows in slow pace if they are interesting, but I find myself completely disinterested and bored of this series. The formula for BSG seems to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will become more interesting, but in episode 3 I can barely follow. In fact, it's at the bottom of my watch list for the week. This is a state of sad affection. The Syfi Channel has really destroyed their range Friday night. Anything happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
