Awful. This thriller should have been buried. What a piece of shit. The terrible writing, the characters are less than credible. Horror Schlock! There are a few B stars in a very writing POS to try to give him a little credit, but he does not manage to hurt. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given it a word review, start with "sh" and end with "it". Horrible, late termination. Who writes this stupidity. The ending of this film is so controversial, it's as bad as it would have no idea what to do with this story, or it just ran out of money. Probably because of the number of camels in this movie. It is a good thing these actors are on their way out, because they would be a career killer. Good for them that hardly if no one will see it. At least one is not important, such as future investors. It may have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated of my precious time. Do not bother with this, you will feel like you have wasted the time you can never get back to.
