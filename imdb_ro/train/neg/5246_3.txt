Wow, the most spooky thing about this episode was the house price 40 years ago. I will preface by saying that I am not a fan of narrative episodes. If the story / actors / etc. they deserve their salt, they should be able to convey most of the story without having to read it, remind me of characters who can not think about the cuff, but rely on teleprompte. The psychobabble was boring and boring, but some enjoy this sort of thing, it's not just my tea tea. He could have kept the story, but at least he would have made it much more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a newspaper reporter or something like that. Strange small things like Peugeot being at home, which has only one half-circle exit, yet it seems he parked his car in the tree he was standing on because there is nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . Sloppy type processing, as she enters the access path (for what seems the seventh time) exactly what the two guys you see are 24 feet away when you go to the car as she enters the landing the deserted house? Also dolly miniatures have been overstretched, just like a high school pupil who first discovered the zoom function on the camera. I could still do it, but that could be almost as boring as this episode. He continued to shoot and the real purpose seemed to be to use all the materials they had shot from Elaine who was driving the convertible at Newport. I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle game while a voice told us everything about the 8 tracks track, automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about one is that it ends only abruptly. There are no free ends, nothing explains or ends. Not that many would notice, I guess most have already changed their channel or disappeared to the end.
