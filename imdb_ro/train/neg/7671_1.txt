The movie begins with a scrolling text that takes almost five minutes. It provides the basic summary of what is happening. This could easily have been done with the action, but you will get a text scrolling effect. As soon as you are bombarded with characters you learn a little, remember that this is all you will learn about them. The land begins to descend and then collapses throughout the film. Not only does the sketch change, but you might even wonder if you look at the same movie. I never played the video game, but I know the people who have it. From my understanding whether or not you have played this movie is not doing better. Save your money if you do not like sleeping at theaters.
