Immediately after renting and watching this movie a few years ago, a friend and I decided that he defined zero zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the movie that could have been worse than it was. Until now, the rate of movies, even the very bad, is much better than The Lonely Lady. A long time ago, I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the scripts among others "Last Summer" and "The Journal of a Crazy Housewife," and she said she was asked to write a script for Harold Robbins' book "The Lonely Lady". She said she sent a treatment and was rejected because she did not think she understood the difficulties of a Hollywood screenwriter. Then he said, "I think they have someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the release of the film. He died in 1981 and bet that the first thing he did when he arrived in heaven was God's personal thanks for saving her from involvement in the result.
