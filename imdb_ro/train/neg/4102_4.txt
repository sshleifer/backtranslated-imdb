"Dead Letter Office" is a low-budget movie about a couple of Australian postal workers who are struggling to rebuild their destroyed lives. Unfortunately, the action is weak, and the links between the past misfortunes of the characters and the current mentalities are ruthless and over-schematic. What is most disappointing, however, is that the portrait is life in the office of the title of the film: there is no mechanization, and it is impossible to establish what a person really does. Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this kind of office was definitely closed in the 1930s if it really existed. It is a shame, since the general tone of the film is full of malice and evil, and in the scenario there are some promises: but little convincing details. On the whole, it feels the work of someone who has not experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and a sketch, but unfortunately something else.
