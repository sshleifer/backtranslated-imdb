this movie was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie was called something else nobody would even notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> really strange because I can not see the point. prequel and sequel allows you to just say they do not make sense, nor do they fit. maybe I'm naive, but it's not a vol 1 & vol 2 to fit. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in prison in the first and dies in the original, and in prequel he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was OK, but it would have to change around some actors and part of the story line and the name of the movie and it would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really waited for it to end as the other began. <br /> <br /> If anyone has a say about this post, please.
