I do not know what you're talking about, the first time I watched this movie with two of my friends, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest I've ever seen. Comment on pornography is so right, though hahahaha. Yes, this movie is actually worse, but it has brought tears to my eyes because of the fake characters, weak dialogue and action. Not to mention the expensive rooms they used to shoot them? Looks like one of those movies in my drivers. class. The breakthroughs show that they have emerged from a high school theater show. Music sounds like it's from an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that really came to scare me about this movie was that he had a killer clown that is not stuck with fat, listening to clowns? hahaha if anyone should ever see this, however, they have to look at the verbal errors of the actors, such as the clarification of words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha I died. SESAME
