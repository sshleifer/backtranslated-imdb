"Paula, maybe I'm a bitch, but I'll never be a boy!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in a pretty tiring skin film that has a beautiful honey in Stacey Walker, but it's all about it. This gallop is a real whistle that attracts friends, colleagues and even her lesbian roommate, Paula, into her bedroom, but then turns into a crying job calling out "rape" and calling the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this c ** t certificate is interesting for a little while, but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive business. At least the end is worth waiting, for those who will care since then.
