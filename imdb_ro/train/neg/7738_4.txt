The movie was "OK". Not bad, not good, just fine. If there was anything else in the theater, it would be omitted from afar. Unfortunately, fast and angry 2 also stunk but I would rather see FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Ford Harrison or another punk young, it will be a "cute" movie for you. Personally, I would wait for HBO or Blockbuster.
