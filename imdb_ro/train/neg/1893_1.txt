This movie became extremely stupid when things started to happen. I would not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the main actor (forgetting his name) also got nervous about me. I do not remember how it ended, and so on, but the whole idea of ​​aliens that possess human bodies and still seemed stupid in this film, things have not gone away. My dad told me it was a stupid movie ... I should have listened.
