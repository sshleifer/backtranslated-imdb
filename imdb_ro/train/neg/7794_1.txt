This movie is terrible of God. There is no quality for this movie. You would think the gore would be good, but it's bad. The effects are worse and the action, if you can call it, is the worst thing I've ever seen. This movie was shot clearly on a video camera and probably runs on a budget of about $ 500. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the Dead or Death Day. If you want to watch a cheap movie on the movie Zombie movie like this, but better than watching Redneck Zombies. Avoid this movie at any cost. It is undiscovered and useless. You were warned. I have nothing to say about this stupid movie.
