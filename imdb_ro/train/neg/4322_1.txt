Read and note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (that's it!) <br /> <br /> The film is about to produce (think) a small, modern American town, the fabulous American-style Capra. If it fails ... completely and absolutely fails. I tried to think of a good thing and I can not. Let me mention some of the most important ... People do not die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in the trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send a beautiful letter to him). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I will not spoil it for you, but there must be a light in the movies if only to contrast with the dark, but it does not exist. Even the photo is bleak - the snow is shown at the end of a freeze, wherever it looks cold, damp and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you might guess, the movie has a happy ending (schmaltzy). What a relief !
