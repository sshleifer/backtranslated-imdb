Zu Warriors should have been an animated series because in the movie it's like watching an old acid anime. The movie starts from nowhere and people fly around with wings of metal and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices for her lover on a cloud or something. If this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me, but quite fast, this flying wind comes and kills it, while the rascal guy battles with another mystic God / Demon / Wizard. The plot line is not there or it's extremely hard to follow, you have to be clever clever to get this movie. Soon the plot follows this Chinese mortal who is called by this god to fight the evil flying, the princess killing the bad guy and soon we have a very poorly choreographed Uwe Boll as a battle scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something . Even the visuals are weird, some might say they are stunning and colorful, but I'm going to say that they are blurred and the acidic journey like (yes, that's a word!) I looked so I called with subtitles and Both were just as bad and hard to understand .... I'm kidding that I did not understand at all. I felt she was looking at the episode 30 of the anime of the 1980s and completely missed the story started or how I started I read a series of comics 5 to number 4 because I had no idea how this started where it was going or how it would end and it was lost all the time. I can honestly say that this was one of the most serious movie experiences ever was like seeing Inu-Yasha at the 134-beat episode ... yes, you're right, you do not know what the hell is going on. the brain is trying to figure it out.
