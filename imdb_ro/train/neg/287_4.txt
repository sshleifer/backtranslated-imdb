As a fan of Altman, I've been looking for this movie for years, thinking that with such a large cast, it should be at least marginally brilliant. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's foods that are thrown together, improvised and improvised (or so it feels), with the hope that everything will come together in the editing room. It's not like that. As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable for Alfre Woodard's debut performance, which shines on the veterinarians around her. But besides, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do - it was never released on video - to my knowledge - and cable appearances are Halley's Comet.)
