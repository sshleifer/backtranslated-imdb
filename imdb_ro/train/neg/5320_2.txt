This is a dry and stellar film shooting on one of the most interesting events during the Second World War and in the history of the war behind the front. The dramatic composition of drama is the most serious of this film, because the plot about Hitler's assassination involves a rather dramatic event. There is no development of the character and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play a high-ranking commander who casts doubt on his deep thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I think Mr. Bin would play better. Generally, the film looks pretty much like a copy of a good German "Stauffenberg" television film in 2004, but can not approach this film in any cinematic aspect. However, the film obviously gets its financial target with pop-horn audiences who cherish Hollywood blood and superficial art values.
