This movie seemed interesting; I read the book a few years ago and realized that this feature followed the contour of the plot quite closely. She started to follow her, and from the very beginning she did not manage to rise to the expectations. Actually, I did not bother to watch everything he did to me ... amazing - bad performance, bad action and instantly desperate characters - that was the point in the movie, I think. left a bad taste in his mouth and put on a downer for the rest of my weekend. Do not bother with this feature.
