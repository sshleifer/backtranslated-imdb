I went to see this a few days ago and it's hard to forget the movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie should be funny, it's not a laugh in the theater (maybe for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu) and it's boring, boring, boring. It was hard to understand what they said. They simply spoke and did not open enough to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I got caught by saying a line that should have been funny "what, what he said" and I'm French. I do not like to say that given that I think good films are made here, but I apologize in advance to all the strangers who will go see the film (if presented outside France). I'm very sorry for that cr @ p. 2/10
