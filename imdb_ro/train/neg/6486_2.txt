If there is something you can count on Disney, it's their ability to take a story and tell them again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and Tramp II was a terrible experience. Disney will destroy one of the most beautiful classics in history. He even had that scene of spaghetti meat. It was done before! And that's what I'm telling this bad video directly (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a remix of the original movie and even more Bluth movies. The penguin and the spirit of the mollusks (I even forgot their name) are just a very low carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. It even repeats virtually all of its old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abusive. I've never heard such bad songs from them until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It is pathetic and simplistic. In addition, at least they had time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the regular characters are not as upsetting as they were (or maybe it's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is so cute that you could vomit. I almost did. Do your favor and your fans Little Mermaid. Do not waste money on this. True, it is not as horrible as the return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but there is little consolation.
