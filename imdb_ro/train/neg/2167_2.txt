To die for (1989) was just another dt.v. who made an appearance on the cable we found in the early nineties. The only remarkable thing about this feature was the last movie in which Duane Jones appeared. Besides, there's no reason to watch this vampire blow if you do not like to like pseudo-chicks as a horror movie. A tired vampire wishes for love and looks in the back streets of L.A. looking for it. Will he succeed or Vlad will give up again as in the last century? This movie must have been great, because a few follow-ups soon followed. They are so bad that they make it look like a classic. I know this is a vampire movie, but movie makers could have used it. He did not recommend me, because I did not like it. Nuff said?
