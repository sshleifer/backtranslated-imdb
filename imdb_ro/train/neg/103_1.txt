Without wanting to be a murderer, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and cliché films I've ever seen - one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible, the footprint is unclear and everything about this movie screaming "seriously, you could do better." Perhaps this is a challenge for everyone to tighten YouTube with our own nonsense-related zombies? I bought this for £ 1, but remember, you can not put a price at 71 minutes of your life. You'd better avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement.
