Exactly what you would expect from a B movie. Cute, nudity free, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and special cheesy effects. Of course it could have been better, better acting (defint) better written, directed etc. But then I think it would not have been a movie B. The actors have suffocated quite a lot, in fact, this seemed pretty much like a stinging episode of the vampire killer or something other than a lot of blood, profanity and nudity. Tiffany Shepis must be separated. She is absolutely the queen of the new millennium. Not that the actor is important in these films, but he was better than any other actor. She also smokes hot in that plastic costume she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her posterior position is absolutely amazing in this outfit, that is, whenever she returns around her, she can help her, but she checks it out. Then, at the end of the movie, the viewer is rewarded with her full look nekked. So if you have a horrible b-movie horror movie (like me), check this out. If not, you should probably avoid it at any cost.
