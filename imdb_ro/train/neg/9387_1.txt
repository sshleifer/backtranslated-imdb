I saw this movie when it was released for the first time. The memory of how bad she has been with me for almost forty years. I did not want to trust my feelings about the movie when I saw it, so I reviewed a review of a movie published in a major metropolitan newspaper, confirmed by the following feeling, the reviewer wrote that the film was incoherent, indiscipable and inanimate . A small study reveals that the producer was Leslie Caron's husband, so the blossoming of nepotism suggests the start of the dreadful film. Caron's film, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking, among others, suggests he promises something. But the death of this film is due to its terrible scenario. The "mystery" involved is so obscure and so revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to stage. The film seems to be torn between a mystery detective and an espionage thriller, but he never meets with each other. The feeling of suspense is completely absent. The main characters are to play dry, emotional types in a way that does not inspire any empathy. Cinema is pedestrian. The result is that the unhappy spectator loses interest in characters, plot, and ultimately the movie itself. I am a little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available for purchase. I hope that if TCM finds a footage of this movie and feels forced to issue it safe back to the 4:00 am slot.
