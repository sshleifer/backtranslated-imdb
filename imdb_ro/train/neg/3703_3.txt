I did not expect too much for this movie, but boy boy, I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock does not show a good act here, you can not have the feeling that his character is real, I think the movie would have been a bit better if the drama or romantic scenes would have been a smaller part of the movie and more / a better humor. The film is as if movie makers had a bad hangover doing it. In "doing" of them does not show a single smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave her three out of ten because of the few smiles she gave me, but I never laughed!
