Okay, "enjoy yourself" is a relatively relative term, but the flexibility is fine when you're dealing with James Glickenhaus's gallant director. McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, above the action movies I've ever seen, without the ugly edge of the Exterminator. Other comments commented on a suspicion of distrust of the film's heroic middle-aged behavior, but how to make a film in the Philippines that is settled in Colombia? All extra are Filipino. In fact, the only character that looks away from the Hispanic is Victor Argo's good as "El Presidente". Yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting as crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this funny bread to the glories of American imperialism.
