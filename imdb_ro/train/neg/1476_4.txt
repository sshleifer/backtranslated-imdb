This rather formidable sword and flying fist film is an early decay of John Woo's talent. The cinema is excellent and some of the sword works are truly remarkable. Unfortunately, the movie takes place under the tedious boring story and a very low budget (check out some of the battle scenes set if you doubt me). However, it's worth seeing, especially if you can catch in a letter box.
