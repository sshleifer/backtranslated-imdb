(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about German heroic women. But it's too long, does not touch and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not a good enough action. The story (story) is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers the events of her life. Okay, now we have a point of view. There is another introduced woman who does the same thing. Confused is that they both remember the events of others' lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of the basic story ... How can Riemann know about the fate of the little girl and her query, for example? Scenes are presented in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene that Riemann proposes to Fabian. When it happened? The scene seems to have been set in the Twenties ... Riemann's character is, of course, a talented, well-being, even baroness pianist! Wow. Her brother comes from the Eastern Front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" that he performs in some scenes. So he's a hero of war and another good man who kept his conscience. And he got acquainted with the massacres committed by the Germans. He even made some photos! And so, cliché after cliché is thickened and that's why the movie does not work. In principle, von Trotta made a chicken blow from something that could have been a decent film. And in the end it's very simple. Riemann finds a way to bring Goebbels to bed and - yes! - Everyone is free. That is not a historical fact, but a pure imagination despite the claim of the "true story" from the beginning. Like "Sass" is vaguely based on a true event. It's sad, but true, this is the typical German movie these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
