I was not as bad as other commentators. Sure, she has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful sirens with razor teeth that run to cars on a road off the road, come down to the house (at sunset) and invite their prey .... What's going on there ... well, after stripping and kissing the most, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some shine of the room. Some scenes are pretty dazzling and actually shot, but the sex alone does not have a movie up (no word does not intend ... at least consciously). There's not really a story here. We have the two girls. We are shown an inexplicable and inexplicable start where we see them shot with a gun. Why? What does it mean, "Why do we have the guy who stay for a few days to greet a guy at the hotel who insists he knows him a few years ago, does that have a purpose? Of course, I have even more general questions like a couple of beautiful girls who make vampires in the countryside in England and have a wine cellar full of wine from the Carpathians? However, the scenario is full of such defects, and it is rare for action outside the catches, wine and meals (quite literally ), then go to sleep in the trap, and the end happens with some more serious scenes, but it is anticlimatic. There are, as I said, some effective scenes of the director ... I really enjoyed the way the girls dressed and they were filmed in the woods in search of their prey.The house is also an impressive set and both faces are as I said very wonderful: especially Marianne Morris stands out - in many ways than one. , veter the silent screen year Bessie Love has a short cameo to the end of the movie.
