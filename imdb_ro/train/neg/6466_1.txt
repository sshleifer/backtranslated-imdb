Marlon Brando has long lost interest in acting when he made this film. His performance as the "Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's what he wanted to be. He does not go over it. Instead, he acts simply in a bizarre manner and has fun at his embarrassing edges. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst and funniest moment in cinema history. As I saw it fell on a head first in a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are looking at the same actor who played in A Streetcar Named Desire, Waterfront and The Godfather. I think the real question is why Marlon has been acting like this in recent years. Was he sick of the movie? Did he make a complete and complete madman of himself? I think we'll never know. But this movie serves as a fascinating study of what is bad about action is all about. On this note, look at veteran colleague Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed himself because he has agreed to participate in this transvestity.
