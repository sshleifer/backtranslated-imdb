Who, in their right mind, does something as stupid as this movie? The accidental killing of a guardian ... characters that are so two dimensions that a two-year-old could have painted to attract ... and better ... A tool red of death? Please .. <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak ... <br /> <br /> Working from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically this movie moves between teen comedy, thriller , voyeurism and ... feminine ... (uhm) Rambo? Unbelievable and an insult to anyone who thinks. Do not look, go far is far more horrible than you could imagine ... And above all it tries to be hip, being too graphic in its violence ... Mrs. Montford: Shoot ' Em Up was fun and fun, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
