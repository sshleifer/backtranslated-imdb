Before watching Dahmer, I thought no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. To summarize "Dahmer," is a story about a homosexual serial killer who has almost nothing to kill, and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with homosexual men before being killed. There is no plot to be found and has no purpose as it tells us something about "Dahmer." Everything you learn about Dahmer watching this movie is that he likes to have sex with men. Horrible action, horrible, horrible, horrible writing ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, go with the vomiting ... it will be less painful .....
