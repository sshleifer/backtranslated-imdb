The comments I've read for this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to check. IDEA REA! This is another movie about a ghost to take revenge against a group of friends. The story is bad, mix two parts Ringu with a single part Prom Night, a sprinkle of I know what you did last summer and add a small dose of Single White Female - now stir up to totally absurd. There is nothing new in this plot and reviewing the clich√©s we've grown so much has never had fun this time. This movie jumps past and past too much and once I felt it all, I realized that it still did not make much sense. Characters go from the psychotherapist to the psycho killer as it blinks. Speaking of characters, they are all stereotypical your preferences - lawyer selfish greedy, egocentric actress, star baseball video voyeur, bitter girl, baby scary, beautiful girl "beautiful", a black cat ... and I did not care about none of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes, but in general this movie was a disaster. I should also mention a certain "video tape" that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to pull. <br /> <br /> This film is not the worst Asian horror to offer from far away, but it's still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in dark or just want to laugh out loud at some of the top actors over or just want to scream "you're stupid"! to a movie screen or just want to have another Asian horror to raise your sleeve when someone asks you how many of you have seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a decent plot are looking elsewhere.
