One wonders how the script was written. Wayne and the other performers do a good job, but since it's neither comedy nor romantic thriller, nothing else is quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> It feels as if one of the threads was pursued could have been worthwhile. However, it is interesting to see a true turkey of a story made just before the US's direct involvement in the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics is about trying to make a movie for all tastes, but it ends up with something that does not like anybody. However, it has historical value.
