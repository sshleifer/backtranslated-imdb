As I was of Puerto Rican origin, I had mixed stuff about this "documentary". First of all, I was offended that Ms Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Also, just a point of fact, sir. John Leguzaimo is not descendant of the Puertorican. His parents came from Colombia. Anyone who researched this was not very precise. I think the future of our race is based on education. This message should have been resounding in this movie. Education is the road to freedom and power. I think any future efforts of this production team should do so. In my opinion, this film influenced an anti-American sentiment.
