This film should have described a "lady's man" who was ready and willing to sit once and for all. However, I did not care about his mission to settle, because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He should at least have a way of doing himself, which made the ladies weak on their knees, apart from his saxophone play, but without any use. Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to draw a married woman's attention to being in love in five minutes to know her was scandalous and ridiculous. Does this man have any such shame? If he had awakened, and ceased to do silly things, he would have been more appealing as a character, but unfortunately his character was gentle and boring. The character of Gina Gershon was useless by the British. It could have been as easy as an outstated out-of-towner, with her voice speaking regularly rather than a poor British accent that would sometimes fade through the movie. The only two characters I cared about were fish and frog. Now the two of them had chemistry! Nominations at the Academy for both? STATE! Collapse pits, lack of character development, horrible actors, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What misery in a movie.
