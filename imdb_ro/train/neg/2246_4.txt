I did not see the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so they have no means of comparison. It has also been a few years, but I have found this story neither caught nor her captivating romance. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical career is heading in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a disappointed, disappointed red star, embarking on a tale of love with a new, talented singer, Esther Hoffman. Its dramatic success only serves to highlight its decline. The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are well suited to their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot have left much to me. The film is remarkable to me, for one aspect, the beautiful interpretation of Streisand of the Oscar-winning "Evergreen". It really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
