Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once he left for Italy, tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment. First he suffered the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, an artistic failure that would have killed the career of a less resistant actress. And now is EUROPA 51, another boring exercise in soggy sentiment. Even the story does not do much for Alexander KNOX, in another novel role as her long-suffering husband who tries to caress her after the suicidal death of their little son. At least it has better production values ​​and a more coherent scenario than STROMBOLI. Bergman is still appealing here, but he is heading for a more mature look like a woman rich in society. She has never managed to deal with her son's sudden loss, despite the attempts of a good male friend. "Sometimes I think I get lost," she tells her husband. A cruel statement in a movie that does not have humor or grace but gives us a sense of where the story goes. Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve his emotional health, and from there the plot has a bad effect. The effect of the film is that it's not interesting enough to make a project for an important star like Bergman. The film is losing halfway through the story, as Bergman becomes more distracted and the husband suspects that he doubts him. The story comes down from there, after he takes care of a street through terminal illness. The final daughter of the plot has her husband forced to place her to be seen in a mental asylum. Ingrid suffers in noble way through all this (overcompensating her son's loss), but it is not at all useful. It's not one of her best movies, to say it gently. If he wanted neo-realism with mental illness, it would have been better to accept the leadership of SNAKE PIT when it was offered to him by director Anatole Litvak! He would do more for career than EUROPA 51. Summing up: Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
