After I noticed a high rating on IMDb, I decided to visit this movie. Beyond that, I intended to avoid reading any reviews. I wanted to enter the theater with a clean slate without knowing my plot or predetermined expectations. Considering my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed developing the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed the way the hotel manager tried to speak from the entrance to the hotel room. Until Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some frightening things. On the pillow appear candies and the toilet paper is bent. Enslin reacts in a credible way. It got scared. I am encouraged and thinking about myself will be fine. People who made this film understand that less is more. But what happens next was a great disappointment. Subtlety is quickly replaced by the foreseeable approach to burglary ... Just distract the public with every Hollywood trick in the book and hope something works. Let's see, a clock radio that starts on its own? Okay, that's always scary. Objects moving in the room? Okay, you can not complain about that. Blood spilling from the walls and the sink? That's great. Ghosts who commit suicide? Good. Something else? How about loud noises, trembling, fire, more, trembling, room breakage, more blood etc. It's all good. And everything was done before. Overstimulate the lack of attention Disordered audience with all sorts of things in rapid succession and will not be able to look. It did not work for me. And you know what else? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it is typical to hear more groups of girls in public, shouting for fear in frightening moments. But this movie did not have frightening moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I did not feel cold in the corner of the spine. Nothing. Shining has been 100 times this movie is trying to be. So, what are all these people who say it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just do not understand.
