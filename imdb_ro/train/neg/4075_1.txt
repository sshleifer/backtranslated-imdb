I'm a horror / gore horror film and this movie was so bad, I felt embarrassed not only for the actors, but also the director and the poor digger of a producer who put his money for this schlock. /> <br /> From the title, you would expect some great massacres in a story and at least one direction or dialogue. Instead, you'll get what looks like a more violent and sexier episode, Trei Stooges. At least I laugh at Three Stoogi. As I watched this stupidity, I turned another TV and started to see Howard Stern until something interesting happened. There's no need to say that I've seen Stern. Watching this movie, I realize I can produce a movie with three monkeys, two DV cameras, 50 free dollars and a broken PC. This movie is my inspiration to get into budgeting without a budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is nothing here but a lot of little talk and action. This makes KaZaam look like a Meryl Streep movie. I'm sure Germany did not forbid it because of sex or violence. Other countries need to remember.
