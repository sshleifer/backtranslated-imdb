I have to say honestly that I can not stop watching this movie from the second beginning. Simply for how bad it was! It's just like watching dry paint just a lot more confusing. I mean you're sitting there and waiting for something to happen, in fact, preferably something that makes the whole movie make sense! At the end of the movie I was right there, wondering if there was a chance I had missed the first hour that explained everything to me or if I had accidentally lost during the movie and lost the parts that stuck the plot existed, one fact) together! The most important thing that really bothers me about this movie is almost at the end of the main face (if there really is a main girl) was in some sort of alternative reality, I mean what the hell is going on at this moment? she suddenly woke up and was in a mental institution bound in a drug-doped bed or something, then faster than he'd given me to cut my wrists, turned back and was eaten by vampires the random did not make any sense! I am tempted to send emails to the producers and ask for my time back, that is, I have lost 2 hours of my life looking at this trash! I'm interested in knowing if movie makers do not know why it is! it seemed that someone edited all the bits that could have made sense even though I think the movie should have taken 4 hours to do it! I find myself completely with the other person who wrote the other review, I was royalist with this movie, by title, and alone. I'm so thankful I'm not buying the movie, no matter how many times I've seen it in the pound store. You would have thought I would have given a clue that the movie was a complete pile of movie steam trash but to be honest I think Â£ 1 was too much money to spend on this movie !!!! what a tremendous amount of time and a good shave, I want to say that I want OD'ed, less painful than watching this movie !!!!
