The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this thin-woven plotting dog, the poor script, as a gloomy quality, and ridiculous continuity in editing this mess together. It has some memorable moments, but it quickly dries quickly. As a child I remember this as a Luke-hot vehicle for the two comic actors, but it was not always strange about the flow and the feeling of what was being transmitted in each scene and how this link to the overall plot . Watching it again many years later, shakes shlock-a-mania. I'm not so preoccupied with racial controversy, as I would not mind seeing a movie that takes the issue on with a bit of frivolity. The most obvious guilt for me is that the scenes are set as a chaotic series, non-related 2 minute comedy situation (even the ones not very good at that) that were stapled together by the publisher after one night white to the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations on a ban, without any reason, between scenes and scenes, making it feel like no one has any idea what to get out of the scenario. Not that there was a jewel to begin with. I feel bad about the two actors whose heritage is destroyed by this disaster that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
