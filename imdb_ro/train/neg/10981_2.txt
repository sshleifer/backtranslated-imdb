Or listen, for that. Even the soundtrack is a cellar. Honestly, it's not the worst homosexual movie I've seen (which would be about Billy), but it's very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This pulls and pulls and pulls. It's not that this plot is inappropriate - it would work in the hands of a good writer. . . it could have been a lot more fun. There is no parcel point you do not see coming ten kilometers down the road. Dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to the wound, it is full of unidimensional, stereotypical homosexuals. Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relationship between the two leadership was possible, much less real. There is no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact no evidence of the fact that the rulers love each other. . . I just said that they are in love. It's hard to think when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Like the same book? ? The actor is not totally evil, but the pace of movement is hard to tense. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slowly but without quality Jarmusch. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch's films, avoid this.
