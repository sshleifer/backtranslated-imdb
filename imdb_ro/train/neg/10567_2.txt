I thought this film was a case study on how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I'm a director, I give him a 2 for consistency. Problems remain from start to finish, partition being highly predictable using bits and tracks of most, if not all,. The computer-generated graphics was too much like watching a point video game and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what she had to do but did not find that information. It seemed that this project pushed the limits of a low-budget film, a production that attracts the spectator together with the story without the imagination being hired. The actors were not bad, but the plot needed more innovation.
