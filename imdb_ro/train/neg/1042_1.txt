First of all write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. Then we bring amateur actors. It will be good for the hype of the festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years doing their job? Then you hire a cinema that does not know how to shine. See, if it's well lit, it will not look "real," and people at the festival will not like it. Who needs professional-level photography anyway? Then you hire a ten-year-old who has never had a room to be your operator. It will give your film an amateur touch that festival writers will mistake for "reality" and will guarantee that although you will empty the seats to real people, critics and a little shield of the over-intellectual audience will scream "genius" they will not think this was just a complete amateur watch. Once you've done this, buy your ticket at Bad aka Sundance Film Festival. sad waste.
