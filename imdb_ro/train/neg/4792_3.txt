Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... wonderful. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. Even if I'd love to stay for this movie, I just can not. The movie seems to have "sold". The first bad signs appear when the movie has trailers for other movies at the beginning (something the others have not done). Also, too many unnecessary characters, primary examples for the child (which is a crack shot, funny initially, but soon you want it dead), the woman who uses karate to fight balls (it will not work or should not ) and thriving zombies (what the hell do they do there is no connection with them in the other Phatasms). There is also a severe lack of stones running around. The only good bits are the beginning of the crack and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILER comes) br /> <br /> For me this film seems like a stuffing between II and IV as extra characters just leave it to the end, so it can continue with the main 4 in IV. Overall, very disappointing. 3/10
