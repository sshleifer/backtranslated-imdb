I've been watching this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving the movies. Although I tried, I could not stay at this film at all, worse and worse as the movie continued. Although I know it should be a comedy, but I did not find it very funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and jaded representation of rural life. If this is what some of you think the country's life is like, certainly not. I have to agree that some of the trained members were nice, but the French guy was very fake. I have to agree that she tried to have a good lesson in the story, but in general my recommendation is nobody to watch her, it's too annoying.
