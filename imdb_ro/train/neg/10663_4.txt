The film was not a waste, except for boring scenes between them. But the women cast gave a fairly good show than the men who were ridiculous. But Krista Allen really embarrassed in the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. Scene in bed involving Krista should have shortened, but she did so much more sexy than anybody could do. Krista is indeed one of the best in such roles. He also adopted quietly as baddie in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the film. Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not the best action star. He could have chosen a better scenario than that. I think he did for the money.
