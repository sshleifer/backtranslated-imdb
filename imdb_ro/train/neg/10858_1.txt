I did not know if I would laugh or cry to see that. Only Danni dump fans could have a taste for it. This should be a horror movie, but in this case there is only dirt. The hottest scene is the car crash, with the real best of Hollywood special effects. Avoid this movie at any cost. See this only for studies about how bad a movie can be ................
