I am a great fan of the old Westerners and I do not think Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help this 1957 film, which carries almost all the characteristic features of the reformed gun pistols, which has turned into a good guy. a virtuous woman, a virtuous woman, a city that must return to a machine gun for salvation, etc. I can only see the name of the last writer and the young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Any nepotism out there? I've seen a better adventure in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization by Chill Wills. Have I already reached the 1000 words?
