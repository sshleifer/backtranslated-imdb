From filthy naive African strangers, our overbearing directors acting as narrators to horrible fake ears that turn sweet Indian elephants into African elephants to total lack of logic, to Maureen O'Sullivan's continuity, shouting " Tarzan! Tarzan! ", There is nothing about this movie that deserves the classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
