It's a little hideous production, capable of providing a nightmare and headache. It's a harmless combination of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not a fun, weird fun trip that somebody hopes for. He's cold, inhuman, unfriendly, ill, strangely odd. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. Cosgrove Hall also made things much more attractive with stop-motion. Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, she reaffirms the stereotype that the French have no scary concept.
