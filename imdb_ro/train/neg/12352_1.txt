<br /> <br /> How this movie received an average of 6 stars is beyond me. The script is so banal, and frankly an insult to the life on which it is based. Cinema comes straight from the world of advertising, and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show any surprise by participating in this movie if we look at the song list. On the whole, a "high" style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
