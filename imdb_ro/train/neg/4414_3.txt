Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorable nun, because he can not give up on this concept. The song "Sister Maria Ignatius explains everything to you" was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lamp, a bitter satire, a confident lady, doctrinaire, and a very judicious nun - and, as interpreted by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists on taking this exaggeration seriously - while, as I mentioned, keeping the same tone in the scenes "explains all". The two approaches collide in the head and in the last twenty minutes, the film goes off the track, collapses in the gorge and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and the encounter with Sister Mary were adorned with the scenes of Sister Mary. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary were presented more realistically. This simply does not work at all.
