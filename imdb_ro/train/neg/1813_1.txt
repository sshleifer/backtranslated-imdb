If someone wants to make a really bad movie, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a benchmark to measure the depth of wickedness. Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a white "wand" costume, which looks as if it had been sewn together from the pieces of carpeting thrown. Work slowly, painfully, through less special effects that deny the viewer the suspension of mistrust. Add a garden gnome (only for the best). <br /> <br /> In the second thought, skip this movie completely and find something to do for an hour and a half.
