I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels, and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason why, but it's even the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the shining casting of legendary Liz Renay ("Disperat Living") could not save this piece of worthless garbage. This movie should serve a lesson for all the past, present and future movies ... when you have a movie as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders" you should probably have left the lie to sleep and certainly not try revive twenty years later (if you do not have the financial support to shoot a higher sequel, as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do this you should probably spend a little more money than you did for the original and for God ... NEVER to shoot a movie on film ... why filmmakers are really trying to do this when everyone knows the quality will prove to be hideous ... I personally, however, to see a movie made in this way that deserves the powder to throw it into hell ... if you can not afford to do a better sequel than the original movie, do you sell movie rights to someone who can ... and what did Ted V Mikels (or smoking) think when writing this god - a wful script? I mean, come on, foreign dogs and cats from another planet? A painted cardboard box look like a devastating machine capable of eating human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, have been paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are paid a long way! Avoid this movie at any price and watch the original in return.
