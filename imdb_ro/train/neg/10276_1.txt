So you could read some of the comments posted on this movie and you might think about yourself: "It was sure a lot of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30th." It is funny that most of these reviews sound as if they came from the same person or at best a small group, coordinated by "Open House" groups. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is really undiscovered. Just because it is "independent" does not mean it gets a free pass. If you want to make a music, either on the film or on the stage, on Broadway or on the local community's playhouse, you should make sure (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dancing, (c.) Have decent sound equipment, (d.) You have a well written score and (e.) you have lyrics that are wizarding and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not save him. It's one of those unfortunate shooting experiences, where I felt deeply embarrassing to everyone involved.
