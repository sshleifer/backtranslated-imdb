This movie was terribly awful. The act was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought about myself, it's an old movie. Then I remembered it was not an excuse! I've seen older movies with better action and so. The music was terrible. He was very tangled. Editing was poor (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) Generally, this movie does not deserve even 1. I watched just because I was so bored and the movie was not fun on me. It was just ridiculous. My pinkie finger on his left grandmother's left could make a movie better than that.
