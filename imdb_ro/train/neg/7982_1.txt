It's hard to say if Noonan and Marshall try to repress Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry or another comedy crew, but anyone trying to imitate could not do that. There is only a slight laugh in this incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and Marshall have no chemistry; Marshall seems to try a guy of Dean Martin, but he does not come close from a distance. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing, but be fun it was not. He seems to think that throwing his arms and legs very much and looking at everyone and everything is the height of the comedy of the screen; maybe for him, but not for the public. I remember seeing this in the theater when he left. He was on the back of a double bills with a three-year Western Jeff Chandler ("The Pillars of Heaven," which was pretty good) and a short feature Three Stooges ("Sappy Bullfighters" that was not) and about 20 minutes in that all the children in the audience threw things on the screen; he was so amazingly stubborn that he did not even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges trousers. I stood at the end (not that I wanted, but my people did not have to take me until the film had ended) and until the end of this mess, I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 years ago on cable one evening and I stayed around to watch to see if it was so bad I remembered. It was worse. The only thing he had done was Julie Newmar, who had been as smoky as ever; other than her, this has absolutely nothing to recommend. The two also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis interpret the Japanese characters as gross, clumsy, stinging mental defects that look good by comparison. Marshall continued to host "Hollywood Squares," and Noonan tried to try to shoot, but most were almost as bad as that. But not too much, because I do not think NICE could be as bad as that. A truly pathetic loss of the movie. Do not waste your time.
