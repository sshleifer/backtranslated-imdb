When I refer to Malice as a noir movie, I do not like masterpieces such as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Falcon Maltese, nor compare Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer, or Luis Bunuel. I only record a protest against the darkness that penetrates this movie from start to finish, as you often simply can not find out what's going on. I can understand the darkness in the night scenes, but this movie was dark even in the light of the day, why did I miss to understand. How, though, would not have changed much if director Becker had filmed her in total darkness.
