Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal, was a big hit B. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie with nothing lost but without the ability to win anything. It's less interesting than the first: in all respects. But it is a worthy aspect. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also want to watch on the screen the former WWE stars or even if you like to watch the sequels, even if they are direct or not. Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was under the average, I think it's not done at work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, nothing far from good. Technical details, well, a production made by Sony can not be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Regardless, just look if you want. If you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... you will never lose.
