I'm sorry, I've already written my opinion on this movie, but today I was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what is scary is that there are some people who seem to enjoy this movie. I do not like to write ugly reviews or to criticize the opinions of others, but I think it's fair to warn someone who might be talking about watching this movie or not. This is not a good movie. I love movies very much and I will look at anything, but this movie made it on the incredibly short list of the movies I watched and I was happy to go halfway. If you are really tempted incredibly, follow the trailer ... this is the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after which there are no surprises, only a shocking bad dialogue to lose time . I love Michael Vartan in the Alias ​​and I do not want to criticize him, but I think it's my job to stop the other people from losing their hours on a movie like this!
