Welcome to a bad ghost story and somebody's nightmare. This horror story finds a newborn husband (John Hudson) and wife (Peggy Weber) haunted by the memory of his earlier wife and the screaming skulls found in their empty mansion and lily pond. Is the husband really trying to lead his bride already crazy crazy? Or is Mickey's learning gardener (Alex Nicol), who took care of the mansion's foundations since the death of the original lover of the house? This low-cost horror hit has a story line that always involves you in the end. The special effects are pretty bad even at the 1958 standards. I swear that sometimes the screaming scream sounds like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the feature film as Reverend Snow is actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the listening gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can catch this as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
