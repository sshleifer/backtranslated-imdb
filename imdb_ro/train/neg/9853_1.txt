I think most people all want to believe there are extraordinary things and that this film does not show any constraints in trying to exploit this to the fullest. The presentation is very interesting, well presented, and graphics are state-of-the-art technology, but they do not work from a scientific point of view. Hydrogen filled the flying vesicles? It should be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is a permanent possibility of catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, do not try to give it up as a fact. Some people will always understand the wrong way. Everything in the movie is fun, but I woke up constantly saying "Brother, oh, what load ..." If you want a FAKE documentary, watch this instead is Spinal Tap. Or at least turn off the sound.
