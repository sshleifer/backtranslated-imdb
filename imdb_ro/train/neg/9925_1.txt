That's been on the 30-year-old DVD for Blazing Shaiba, shining, but not so. Nowhere have I seen Mel Brook's name here and I can guess why, it makes more sense not to associate with this pilot. My Gawd, who would find this funny. Of course there may be a race problem, but it was not funny to me, because it's just not funny. It's as if the writers did not even try to be funny, just to make money to be tied to scary seats. Have this show been expected to go through more seasons when this pilot made it? The quiet, they did not care. It was a quick cash cow that I thank God for not paying her. I think it's useful only for historical purposes, or just to prove how stupid and deprived imagination Hollywood writers can be.
