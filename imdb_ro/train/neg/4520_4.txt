Irwin Allen was great. All his television shows had a big pilot or the first episode. the rest were basically rip offs from his other shows. Several episodes of the Swiss family Robinson have overturned their older TV shows. An episode of the Swiss family is the same as an episode of the Land of the Giants when a party member needs an appendix. The show had a high and too expensive budget to continue. Irwin has lost touch with TV shows since the 1960s. The act is strong with Martin Milner. The stars of children who have arrived there start with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. a bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes as a typhoon and volcanic eruption by doubling "The Master of Disaster"
