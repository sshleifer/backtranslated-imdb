Being a fan of the manga and anime from Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this. I have not seen either manga or anime, so I had no preconceived notion. What we have here is a series of terrible softcore movies of the kind that are happening with alarming regularity on TV channels late at night. While it is tainted in comparison with what is crowded in the throats of ordinary cable viewers (the hedgehog of the hero is either drowned with taste behind a strategically attached scarf, or dressed with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture borrow the procedures just gently enough to make them unsuitable for children. While I have nothing against female nude heroes, I do not like amateur movies made (there are at least four in this series). In addition, there is at least one amazingly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I've seen. No wonder TESTICLE BOY from Nagai has never succeeded ...
