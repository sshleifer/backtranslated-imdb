I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection and one night I decided to see it; although it does not wait too long. As the opening credits roll, I'm surprised to discover that this movie was made under Filmirage. Filmirage has brought such astonishing stinkers to the world as "Troll 2", "Ator Invincible," and "Quest for Mighty Sword", so I was forced to watch. the potential of being quite decent, although it was non-original. Gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the rhythm began to be dragged and I woke up thinking, "Somebody better better killed soon" or "Somebody better moved." At the beginning of this struggle, when I had these thoughts, though someone might have killed or moved, however, as observed, the gorillas and effects were not very good. What made things worse was the fact that stage transitions were confusing; for example: the first Dr. Houseman would be at the Zoo, then he would have flashed back about eventual killing someone, eventually woke up in a cold sweat in bed - making the audience wondering: "It was seeing that was the Zoo? " Just like the rhythm of the movie, these stage transitions have become increasingly bad. I was able to say that Dr. Houseman's character development was pretty good, but towards the end of the movie, that is, you saw what the doctor turned to, we hope you will laugh - which, indeed, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this unintentional movie runs like a long joke. <br /> <br /> The costume of the monster, which Dr. Houseman gets, can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's Quest for the Strongest Sword, which was made the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they always reuse the same things!
