All these commentators are on the spot. I have seen many bad movies over the years, believe me, and this is the batch! It's not just a waste of time for a "so bad a good" exploiter, but a true, hilarious, atrocity movie. <br /> <br /> CHECK the furry white monster stuff! <br /> <br /> FIND YOU TO Thom Christopher's "witchcraft"! IN SHEER AND ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! to gaskets sets! This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of those who participate in "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" are not aware of the fact that they appear in a movie! FACT! I first watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from coma and sleep deprivation. I had to see a copy a few weeks later to make sure it was so terrible. It is. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, much more ridiculous than all John Derek's films, this is really the Citizen Kane of Trash.
