Why is Colin Firth on Earth in this unnecessary movie? Was it really money-related? The movie is not clear about what it wants to be about, grief, exotic places, ghosts, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a mess muddled, muddy. There seems to be an idea that Italy must be good in itself and that the Italian has something to offer as a language - but ultimately the girls just want to return to Yankland. There are unnecessary episodes on the beach, in churches, on crowded roads - but what it is or why someone should take care is simply not clear. /> <br /> There was also a woman in the movie. It was not clear what was here, but it seemed to be just there to make vapid, inappropriate, and maudlin girls. Should it have to be paedophilia? A rather terrible misery as a whole. I gave him 2, rather than 1, because he does not have the charm of a completely confident film.
