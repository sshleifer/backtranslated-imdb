First of all, this movie starts in a great note: a 10 year old girl playing in a moving vehicle decides it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then cause a terrible accident that kills mother .... duh .... I am sorry, there is positive not 10 years, that stupid. The rest of the movie does not get much better. After the death of her mother by the most wonderful 10-year-old on the planet, Dad moves his family to Genoa, Italy, where he has to study at a local university, but here is the clich√©: he does not speak the Italian word! Then the little girl has "visions" of her mother (whom she killed) and often of subsequent night terrors, which always ends with the father who kept her and surrounds her. Then we are forced to see that this family is continuously lost, then found, then hugs and then weeps and gets lost and then finds (followed, of course, more hugs and crying) to the point where I wanted to a natural disaster, just wipe out all those ignorant people on the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I like Indians, but an indie about stupid people (and I am so amazing) is simply ridiculous and useless. It is really a shame that this film is based on such insipid characters who were spinning in such retarded scenarios because the place was interesting.
