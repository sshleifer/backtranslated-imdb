This is one of the many minus B films, labeled as a noir movie, hoping to generate an interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the movie - scenario, action, direction - are mediocre. Operation through the three ends is made of wood. I think John Dall was expected to go to the movies, but then somebody realized he had a little talent and therefore got to work on television. Lee J Cobb, who is usually terrible, can not rise above bad scenarios and bad direction. Jane Wyatt should be a fatal woman, but she does not come close to convincing the audience. The movie has two of the weirdest cars I've ever seen, one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. DVD transfer is typical Alpha.
