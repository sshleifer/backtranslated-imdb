I had no idea what the film was about before seeing it, because Tashan had teaser trailers only when he was promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it, and they said, "It's Vijay Krishna Acharya's directorial debut who wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 and 2, and Saf Ali Khan's son, Ibrahim, makes his film debut by playing a child in retrospect. " After watching him, I understood why he was not a suitable trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show him. The story was extremely big, and even a 10-year-old can come up with a better story. There was almost no action, and the camera shuddered at every possible angle, and it is difficult to understand who kills who. Also, the action was unclear and unrealistic, eg. One man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. While watching Tashan, he reminded me of three films: Sin City: During the opening of credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor's English giant, like Amrish Puri in Koyla. Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: ridiculous ridiculous jokes that are not even funny. <br /> <br /> I also heard that the budget is 40 tailors, which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2, then there's absolutely no chance you'll like Tashan. The breed was warm on the heels and that's a million times better. The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece in good locations, but what's her use in a movie trash? Even Anil Kapoor's English language has failed to save this disappointment.
