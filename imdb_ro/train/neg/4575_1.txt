I will admit that I am just a college student now, a great Englishman in this. At the time I saw the movie, I was a high school student - I mean the junior year, but maybe it was senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes a long way in the honors course of physics, the interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read this topic in a series of books on the theoretical aspects of the field, as well as any article I can find Discover and also. I'm not a doctor in any way. <br /> <br /> That's what he said ... This movie is just terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the New Age guru, who desperately wants to believe in how special everyone is. My mother is such a person, and since she saw this movie, she tried to make all her friends see her and bought a copy of the movie. I tried to highlight the various shortcomings and problems I have seen with the logic of film and science - and there are numerous - and rejected my allegations because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those doctoral students "In this case, apparently so, leaving behind the fact that winning a doctorate does not necessarily mean that a person is correct or intelligent, leaving behind that my basic understanding of physics is enough to discover half From the film, leaving the filmmakers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear to have sustained their beliefs when they actually opposed them completely, but I think the intruder did a great job of debugging the movie, so do not hesitate to read that if you are careful to do this, http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
