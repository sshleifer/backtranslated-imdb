I could not wait to see this movie. About half the movie, I could not wait to finish. All the actors (whites) were making lines that Woody Allen had just said, "Tell them that ..." Then they said their lines on the screen as if trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks, and he does not stop his words, like Mr Allen. The comedy part of this movie was as boring as the tragedy and certainly never fun or even fun. I have to admit that I was never a big fan of Woody Allen and this movie did not convert me for sure. I think his writing was just as bad as his direction. This movie will fall as one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen.
