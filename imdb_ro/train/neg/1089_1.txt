What about Robert "the pretentious" Altman? Has he saved the enlightenment? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a law firm where everyone works in the candle light? Do not waste time. In fact, do not waste your time with everything Altman does: it's a pretentious movie loss.
