It might have been a good movie if it explored something more exciting than the surface of a lesbian relationship if it were the meaning of the movie ... it is quite predictable, not to mention that the two girls resemble the Russian tATu group. ..coincidence? I do not think. There is nothing original in this movie to support it, so they had to use something already known. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I do not know what their role should be. Most are well known in Romania and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (eg Mihaela Radulescu). SO to summarize: "father of the girl" + desperate / publicity that needs "actors" + a nonexistent plot + opportunity to use bad language to shock = sick love ... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I'm serious about the title comment ...
