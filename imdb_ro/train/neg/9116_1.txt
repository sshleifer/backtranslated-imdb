There is no decent scene. Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy who plays Sebastian sucks too. It does not even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. And the other two girls are terrible. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also shit. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (About to have triple): If you can not beat them ... Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat them? Lame. The end contradicts the whole plot of the original. In the first film, it's clear that Kathryn and Sebastian never did sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, besides playing Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl she could not have and killed" . It was a crap that liked to play with him. The fact that he never gave it increased his desire. Then, in this P.O.S., it means she can have it, along with a girl on the side. What the? And we do not see sex either. It's implicit, making it not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but worthless. And first, Kathryn rejects Sebastian for falling in love, making him a loser. Even if she won the bet, she crushed her chances. Then, in this excrement, he loses and falls in love. So it does not screw up "misses", just miss it completely? Another thing: Sebastian is said to have never been in love, so what do you call Virgin Girl? Finally, the little girl is suddenly discovered as Kathryn's lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they enter a third of a thick screen. Dumbass. <br /> <br /> There are other contradictions in the plot. Writer saw the very first movie? A 5-year-old is able to straighten things out. After that, Sebastian had sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind behind a limousine, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned into evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist Stand in front, listen and smile badly the room. <br /> <br /> The end ... Seeing Sebastian become the bottom hole he was in the first one, he could have made an interesting movie. I think all that was necessary to do little harm Sebastian was a trio with two hot girls. Interesting.
