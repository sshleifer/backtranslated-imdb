It really struck my mind when someone meets a movie like this and claims that this is one of the worst movies in the world. This is far from being one of the worst there, it's not a good movie yet, but not the worst yet. Go to see something like Death Surse or Lake Blood and then come back to me and tell me if you think Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The movie has a decent job and editing, which is much more than I can say for many other obscure movies. you see that your saw breaks into a throat, but all the other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean it's not a slasher movie, just one bad one. The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it was certainly a reflection on the traditional slasher elements made in a cheek-tongue. For example, after a murder, Charlie heads to the city's "welcome" sign and marks a smaller population. This is one thing that can only laugh. If you're in motion pictures, surely give this movie a watch. It's a little different from your regular movie, with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The comedy of the film tells the audience enough to relax and not to take the movie so God becomes serious. You can forget the movie, maybe you remember. I remember because I like my name.
