I do not know where to begin; action, special effects and writing are just as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff reached a point where they said, "Our work is done, the time for its release." I am glad that the first two of the series have never been to the UK. I would really recommend watching this movie just to appreciate how well most movies are made. I do not know how any of the other IMDb users would be frightened when dinosaurs "terrifying" corridors down with rubber arms around.
