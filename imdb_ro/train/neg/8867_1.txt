This movie, by Oscar Petersson, is unique. Its uniqueness is not in the story, since a half-brain production in Hollywood served us comparatively miserable parcels, but rather in a detailed manner that total and total frightening in one aspect is combined with an equal swearing in all other aspects. /> <br /> The dialogue is worse than embarrassing. The rounded and abrasive drive direction is thrown into the mix. Bosnians speaking English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentionally humorous element. The inanimate light and working with the room are the icing on the turkey film cake. As a kind of surprise for the public, there are some slow-down sequences completely unmotivated, where you would expect the least. To add insult to the injury, everything is cut by someone lacking any sense of sync. "The evil man returns well after hearing a good guy speaking" in the church, is the point at which it is time for Ed Wood to be deposed from the position of the worst director of all time; Get over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
