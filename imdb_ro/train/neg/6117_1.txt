I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think so, because when it was first released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough because my girlfriend insisted on going let's see it actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets and (2) it's the only "serious" movie that I remember where the audience started to collide at a certain moment and actually laughed at film, the rest of the way. Once we have reached the scene of the infamous (and endless) fight of the serpent, I think everyone has quit. The only positive one I can recognize is the shooting of the lush location. Oh, and there's Bo's boobs, though her role is so woody that nudity is unerotic and not much more than a Playboy pictor. The "dramatic tension" in this film lies between Bo's terrible appearance and horrible direction of her husband. The snake fight must be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever shot. However, this is one of those films that is quite bad, it can be looked at at the level of unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
