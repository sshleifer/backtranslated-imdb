One of my best friends brought this movie in one night with the words, "Want to watch the worst horror movie ever?" I always enjoy a good laugh at a dreadful horror movement and I said yes. I was expecting your typical b-slasher cheese, but that was beyond B. This is the Z-slasher, the smallest of the little ones. Obviously a low budget, an extremely bad action, a bad lightning, no plot, the so-called "special effects", uncluttered rooms and a terrible soundtrack, the movie, like House of Wax, looks like a Oscar winning masterpiece. The only good thing about this is about 15 seconds from one of the melting characters - she had very beautiful tits. Most of what I said during this movie was alongside "Wow this is really SO BAD," "This is the worst movie ever," and "I'm not drunk enough for that." So, in conclusion: do not waste your time (or money!).
