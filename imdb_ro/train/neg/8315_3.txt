What a lost opportunity to make an interesting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration of what she really feels is a straight (or homosexual) man who works in a homosexual sex environment. The dancers continue to talk about their art as if they did not have erotic components. It is possible that they are not all prostitutes in their own name, but they are really sex workers who deal with fantasies and sell private sessions in which more than dances are offered. The film would seem to appeal to women who go to homosexual clubs and then stop employing "dancers" for private sessions. Even club pictures show women just in front of the stage and "dancers" are only playing for women in the audience. This is not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to make private dances for women and straight couples. So, how do they really feel about their admirers and their gay clients? We learn very little. Instead, we get stuffed. A homosexual activist who adds nothing to the study of the right dancers. A manager who tells us about costumes for dramas, but does not give any insight into the life and attitudes of dancers. Mexico City photos are generic. Falcal roasting of sausage steaks is ridiculous. This is an absolutely simplistic film that should be of interest only to those who want to see some pictures of nice dances. The rest of the film is an insult to homosexual men.
