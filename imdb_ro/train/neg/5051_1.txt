I am so amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this film is so exact about Vietnam and NEVER I AM. This movie is equally true about the entire Vietnam war, because Rodney King's beatings are true to all police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and happened), but generally people are just like you and me. They have morals, they're not killing machines, they do not do drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. It has happened much less than the "hype" would make you believe. Oliver Stone has a talent to make movies that show the Vietnam War as this brutal blood bath, but it is based as much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe stereotypes in Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA have done much worse for South Vietnamese than any soldier in the United States. Fact: World War II soldiers treated the enemy much worse than the Vietnamese soldiers and were blessed when they came home. The good Americans who have served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although the war was badly politically bad, no one could have asked more than our soldiers and it is a great disadvantage to say that this "more true" fiction is how things were really there .
