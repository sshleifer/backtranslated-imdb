I have come to realize that I am watching the euro horror, especially the films made by the cult Jess Franco, that you can not expect a plot that makes sense. However, Franco crossed this film; and, despite a surrealistic atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the best directors - Succubus is, unfortunately, a truly horrible film. I have to admit that I saw the cut American version, running around 76 minutes; but if it was not just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is equally boring. Plot has something to do with a woman who wanders around; practicing S & M and talking about garbage, and it's really boring. There is no gore and sex is boring, and most of the runtime is borrowed from a boring dialogue and despite the fact that it is a short film; I had difficulty doing everything to the end. I have to say that the locations look good and Franco did a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director who made some classic garbage movies - but it seems to have been one that he did for the money and generally I recommend you to skip and see some of the director's more interesting works .
