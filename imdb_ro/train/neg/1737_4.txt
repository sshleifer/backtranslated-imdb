The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's premature death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and humility, romance and music, fantasy, and dramatic costumes. In a 19th-century castle in Southeast Europe, a Countess falls for his vow of enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising; she is helped by her ancestor, whose painted image is magical. Betty Grable, in a long blond wig, adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this scenario (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is full of different ideas that fail to handle or have fun. The results are good but not absorbing. * 1/2 from ****
