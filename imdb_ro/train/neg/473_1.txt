That's what my friend Brian told me about this movie after about an hour of it. He could not keep him away. I just struggled with how exaggerated it was, and finally I changed my mind and played it after I came out of adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want, the climax of hacking. Something so uninspired, so impossible to terrify that everything you want to do after seeing it is to sit alone in the dark and not talk to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is being watched. It is not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would recommend this to someone only, to help them understand how unbearable it is. Do not you believe me? Gather. <br /> <br /> Granted, as a nation, we in America do not always portray the peoples of the Middle East in a tasteful manner. But how about a child in a sheikian suit that leaning in a way to a bunch of Castrol engine oil bottles? You will find this here. TAKE HIM? THE SELECTION OF OIL ARABES. I could not believe what I was seeing. The planes flying the kid in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think it funny joke? It's not even close to the "smart offensive". Simply suck and make you want to put someone who was paid to write that little in front. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, a group of five singers called "Land Mines" takes their place in a ball of officers. Okay, are you ready? The joke is SINGLE TERRIBLE and OFF-KEY. Why did I also write that in the lids? Because the joke is POINTED, BROWN, LAUNCHED WITH YOU with a HORRENDOUS Gorge Marathon. Starts fairly mediocre; Cracked glasses, whipping fist rotors ... then there are, are 100% serious, a stop-motion sequence with two frame SHOES WOMANS VENIREA OFF. You have read correctly - the music was so bad, in a single frame, the woman's feet have shoes. In the closest - shoes are stopped! Take it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came out! What F? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless fit of stock images to drive home the point where SINGING is bad. If any human being actually suffered through this stage in the theater, without running like hell, I would be amazed. This movie is sincere as a practical joke to see how quickly people can pull out the doors. Robert Downey Sr. leads the comedy in the way his son respects his drug-free stay. Dumbass. Other things to watch: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music is stifled whenever possible. Every time Liceman appears, he plays a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song. In addition, all actors are doing their best to act as if they are very cool for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. The terrible critic's accent of Barbara Bach. It seems she is trying to talk like a child while running a marble around her on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes in which the boys are all clinging and clinging to a glimpse of their cleavage, as they are in a community classroom community classroom and have been directed to act as excited retarded people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his rebellious dog a condom. Remember; when this movie came out throwing "abortion" and "condoms" was seen as "bad". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a pedophile hungry by boys back when Hollywood believed that "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one and the same. It was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the end. Nothing is wrong with the VCR. This is actually the end. Tell me it does not make you want to explode anyone who ever made a movie ever. Follow this at your own risk. Up Academy was actually known to make other movies, such as The Jerk or The Furious Season, less funny simply by placing the video box next to them.
