I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise line. This is intrigue. This is! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy breakfast and not strangely, but more frustrating, throwing both shoes that way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason I can not understand (certainly not for humor). Add to the Miss Australia mix, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something I will not call the worst ever movie because Going overboard does not match even the basic definition of a movie . We recommend watching this movie because it will raise the position of each bad movie you ever see. I guarantee that the first thing you will say after seeing a bad movie will be "at least not as bad as Going Overboard."
