I bought this movie last week at my local video gallery. It was buying 2 get 2 free and I need it once again, so I chose it. A terrible error. The box reads like it's a very good movie. Well, it starts as if this movie is great. For about 5 minutes, that's it. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who died trying to save Jack, a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a farmer that local people are terrified of. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because he was supposed to be afraid of this bull and to go hunting to find him. That was the first 5 minutes good. What's next will only get 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, was supposed to be on a journey with acid or something else, because nothing else had any meaning that had ever happened. Jack is on the run and finds out that the radio traveler named Mary gives him a ride. I think Maria should be a virgin Mary type. You know, Jesus' mother. But who knows, I could not make heads or tails from it. As they are running ... we see evil, magical visions, phantom encounters, flashbacks, etc. And all these things are done so your brain hurts to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the film back and changed it for something else. It's horrible, I say, horrible. And, in this movie, there is absolutely no battle. If you do not count the first minute of the movie. I hope I helped other people not to waste time in this movie.
