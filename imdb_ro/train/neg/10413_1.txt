There is no reason to watch this movie. If you have earned an extreme sum of money and spent the time discovering every life of pleasure in life and you have reached a point where you are by chance a free end and have time to kill ever, then get this movie from the video store (if you find it and you can sit with your assistant laughing at you, then ask this movie.) Be prepared, however, for your mind to be invaded by an extremely woody instrument that acts absolutely the world (in fact the best actor was the one who did not say anything), Oliver Reed ends his career playing a drunk figure but is waiting to forget that there is a reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy showing her chest!
