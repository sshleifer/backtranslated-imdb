good well A cant b losing time just cause the big cast cast .. I think all I could see is a lot of talent losing their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by whom? some steep pathetic upheavals justified by whom? the race against time? u means waste against time? Ok so first to spoil your child and then to teach him a lesson in which we are so ignorant of this fact, anyone who has said it is a brilliant new concept, probably there are other species, other than man , the message that will be given but could have been given by an alien sitting next to you on the bus rather than going for such a prodigious film to learn that Hindi movies have already proven a lot already and also , i cant lose my writing time about waste anyway!
