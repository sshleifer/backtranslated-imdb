Lady in Cement - PI spoof with Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a Miami homeboat in this rare, fun comedy. Accompanied by an annoying and repeated Hugo Montenegro scandal and a bunch of blows, this 1968 film never gets too gentle to be on television for television movie status. Bill Blocker is effective in acting as the big gallop Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia and Raquel Welch should thank his personal coach. The only thing that makes the DVD to be kept or seen is the collection of Welch's cheese trailers such as Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mama, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge.Even if you get DVD-skip predictable movie and du it's for the trailer library in special features. Besides tons of mysoginistic association - Sinatra scribbles @ homosexual owners of the local go-go bar. A relic that must be put back into the time capsule. D
