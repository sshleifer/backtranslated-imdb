The guys who - I really think of watching this movie - already have some troubles going through their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack Ripper (you think you think) another B, I mean the E-Grade movie is made up of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes are tracked right before they get their splines splattered on a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or funny. If you feel like dirty stuff without a plot, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not sleep halfway by directing this shit. Watch it only if you have absolutely nothing to do alive and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey is crying on the TV.
