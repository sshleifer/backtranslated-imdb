This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not care what critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It is not that it is impossible to be endowed; it's just that 99% of his work is pretentious and exaggerated. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters are like umbilicals, and his novels as a whole are misogyny. I read many of his works (even his realist socialist poetry. That was really terrible) - I just do not understand what it is about. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novels make the reading infuriated. In a movie, all the things Kundera does not like were amplified. Maybe I lost something, but I do not think so. On a side note, I can not believe this is a DVD with collection criteria. No way is this essential movie.
