what kind of sh * t is that? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was followed and as good as the first movie from the beginning, but from the part where protagonists get super powers in their dreams, it has begun to become childish. This sh * t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff, but it was only for 1/3 of the film. The rest are for small children. Plus, he focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways of fighting demons. Why should Christianity always be? This is the totality of orientalism and full of the superiority of the white / western men. Do not look at it, show the little children who love the rangers.
