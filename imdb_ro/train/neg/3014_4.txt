I have recently seen the Landscapes Made at the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film as a photographer because I'm so familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I think the film is doing a good job by conveying its message, I could not believe it was made as a complete trace of Burtynsky's photographs and later popular book. Obviously, a reason for this is the extensive use of still pictures with zooms and pans over them. Although this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the film was just photographs of Burtynsky's book (they already own). It's probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you hold the book or are familiar with your work, it would be better to skip this.
