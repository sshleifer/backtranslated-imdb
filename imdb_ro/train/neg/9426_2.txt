After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two college friends lead to a rock concert, after a lot of lining, hit something and slipped off the road. They wake up in a cabin inhabited by an old old man connected to the wheelchair and her successors. The killers are, unfortunately, very good for a supposed Nasty Video. The twisting end is stupid and predictable. No one involved in the mess will again make something worth mentioning. So there are still happy endings, sometimes. Candy Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full front on the screen <br /> <br /> My degree: D
