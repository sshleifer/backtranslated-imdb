Ooof! It was a mess. Do not fall "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller," that's for sure. In all realities, it fits somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, with just such a big budget, and many more ugly adolescents crying. Simon Le Bon takes over the front and center, while the rest of the gamely tries to hide the fact that they have stolen their entire career from Roxy Music's last three albums. Barbarella's short clips do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the role when singing "Hungry Like the Wolf", but why was a tiger hiding in the audience changing into a tiger-painted woman? I mean she does not sing "Eye of the Tiger "" Hungry like the Tiger "is a Wolf! Whatever it is.) A DVD of Duran Duran's films of the '80s probably deserves an aspect of nostalgia
