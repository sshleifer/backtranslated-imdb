The biggest one that gives me the mistake is they say Zues takes orders from DUTCH. But he speaks to him German. The two vices are completely different, such as "well, he takes French orders" and begins to speak Spanish. James Belushi gives more sense of being a comedy actor, not a detective in the least. The role does not match it, even if it's recommended to be a comedy. For many stereotypical / predictable things. Typical comment or returns. If you do not look at those things, I think it could be a nice movie to watch if you ever watch TV. But I would not suggest hiring her.
