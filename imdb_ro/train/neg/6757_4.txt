The slasher film from producer Charles Band. In the days of Full Moon's biggest success, Band said he would never make "truly killer movies" because he felt that small puppets and big monsters added a fancy element that made the movies better - killing each other are real and less fun. A beautiful philosophy and a real shame that Band, destroying the Full Moon studio through possible business, has become so desperate for cinema profits that it has started to do exactly what Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality . The team behind this team also worked at Delta Delta Die! and "Birth Ritual" - both equally gentle on Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is on the usual top form here as a beginner to a band of guys and dude who decide to make a story about a "crime club." She - as obviously - does everything she can to join and then panic because it was not a true story and the bad lady, Ms. Rochon believed and now everyone will have to run around to be covered by blood and may kill one another no. The choice is there and regarding this movie ... it is not recommended, but not entirely bad either.
