When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually, when you have these types of movies, there is generally a sasquatch, but in this case it is like? 7 or 10 of them? The action was good, the plot was OK, I liked scenes where sasquatch kills the first few victims, which is very good on the camera. I expected it to be a bad movie, but it was very small. This movie was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel needs more sasquatch movies, so I liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one we're reviewing is ok but Sasquatch was not, but I do not review so let me I'll be back on the right track. This movie is good for a rainy afternoon, but for other occasions, no.
