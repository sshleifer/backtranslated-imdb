What a movie dog. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but it's in the midst of a jungle of abominable scriptwriting, mediocre direction, and wood that works most of the play. Many of the characters are terribly serious, especially Colin Friels. Much of the "character development" is done through a foolish voice, and often contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to figure out who speaks the voice because they describe such characters different to those we see on the screen! How do we know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and uncertain? One of these silly voice superstitions tells us. To shout aloud, the nature of his character is half the movie's point of view, and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin voice over! The true murderer is the character, everything about them. fresh from the shelves, despite the fact that we are always reminded that they are meant to be peaceful artists. All are absurdly spoken of for "junkies." No one seems to have a real understanding of life on skis or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.Monkey Grip is not worth more attention than a morning TV movie day.Russy like this one, well shot and technically presented, but an angry, clich√©-driven drama that draws so wide is plausible and eats for hours without going anywhere At least Noni gets her costume on her birthday at every given occasion. i seriously support this junk.
