(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is a good thing about this Pokemon of this poor (doing what you will do): the theme of opening. It has to be the hottest thematic music of any song called japanese Japanese TV anime made for consumers-oops-i-mean-the-young-fans. Unfortunately, we had to add a kind of show after the opening theme. And they could not come up with anything more exciting than the people who hold out loud about books that are better than the books of others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately, I can not imagine why the children would like to stay in a show where the one-thousand-five-minute dialogue of the monkeys occupies 98% of the running time. "Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your wild Pyramid Diamond in a single shot! Do not you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, fool?" HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! " <br /> <br /> "Oh, yes, look at this! I am about to use my Delta Times Pie Card, which eradicates each of your power workers and makes your creature of Uber- Fantastic Doomsday of Ultimate Doom Destruction Beyond Any Significance Useless Attack! Bet you did not see anyone coming! "Really, that's all they ever do in the show, talk. While in another children's show I noticed, the Pokemon commercial phenomenon (every mom soccer boy), at least monsters were courteous to take it from time to time, "Yu-Gi-Oh "just in the quiet words of Roger Ebert magazine," Mirror Orange "," smooth and boring. " Not to mention for a long time (I realize that I am hypocritical here considering the sentence I have just written). This show goes forever. I do not know if there is a plot, and the static monsters do not have the character of Pok√©mon. Even when I did not compare my drawings as a child, this show is shit. It is unintentionally funny, but not fun enough to deserve to see it. Pa pa, sleep tight, dream dreams dreamy.
