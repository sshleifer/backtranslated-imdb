Serge Farnel made a very precise critique of this film in "Rwanda Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) A critic who shows how France is behind all the situations that the United Nations has undergone in Rwanda. UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the forces of genocide. The day before, ten UN soldiers were killed by genocide. That is why UN soldiers have decided to protect their own lives, driving behind the French trucks. By doing so, they have given up Tutsi, which is of course unforgivable. But we have to take into account the fact that the French soldiers organized this situation.
