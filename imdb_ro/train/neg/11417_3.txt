The youth group in "The Fire of St. Elmo," who just graduated from the college, barely seems to be able to get to high school less than four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and foolish, yet the co-writer and director Joel Schumacher seems to hold them as precious stones for a generation. Having an obsolete "up and coming" presentation, a background score that sounds terribly akin to that of "Endearment," and writing to gentlemen the joy of this circle over us, "Fire" is a liarful arson, one that becomes and more shameful as the years go by. * 1/2 from ****
