I will be short to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with an IQ of room temperature. I'm sorry for liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a Seal. They can forget about the project or the fight. It will not happen. You see, hard to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Regardless of 2007, reality can not change things so people do not harm their feelings. Men can not give birth or babies for feeding (Oh-I forgot San Franfreako). Women do not have the physical strength to be on par with men in a struggle or in other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I could not give you a bloody hell if what I wrote just upset you. You're going to think about that - if you bother this, that warms my heart more. I did not write a thing that was not the truth. This imbecile movie is nothing but a comedy and a terrible one about it.
