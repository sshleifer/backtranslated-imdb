An obvious b class effort to make money in the Hostel / Saw pocket, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And yet they managed to disappoint at every level. The actor is so bad that it's not even funny, the plot line is nonexistent and the only scared one was realized that we lost for 1 hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave him a 10-star rating. I can only guess that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. 34th is probably the mother of the directors? - although I'm sure it will be hard to go above 2! DVD extensions include an hour-long feature. Which raises the question: "Why?" (although they can serve to prove what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
