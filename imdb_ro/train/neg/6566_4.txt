I watched this movie after I had so many problems downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say it is not worth it. The parade was so hyped that I was really looking forward to seeing her. Parinda is one of those films that fails to meet the standards set by other good Indian producers, despite having a wonderful story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was freely leaning on the classic "On the Waterfront". Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from America. Direction has been devoid of quality many times, except for a few scenes between them. Give it to any one of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and they are 100 Secrets, they will make a great movie of it. I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. He was not good enough.
