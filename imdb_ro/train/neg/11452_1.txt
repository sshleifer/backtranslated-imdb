If I could have rated this movie I would have had it! I have seen some ppl at IMDb says this is the funniest movie of the year, etc. etc excuse me? are you ppl snorting LSD or ........? There is absolutely nothing fun about this movie N O T H I N G! I really want 27 minutes of my life to be spent in that piece of nonsense. <br /> <br /> I read someone who was sitting on a plane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes, I totally understood that in fact we would have been watching snakes on a plane twice over, in instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, do something else useful in your life, make dishes, walk the dog, fuck ... anything better than spending time in front of a TV that follows a hot rod.
