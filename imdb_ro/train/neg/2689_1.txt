Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really looked "September 11". This movie was generally bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was most effective and direct about the subject, short films were the most boring and, at worst, offensive. The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment, in which he compared Palestinian bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest that suicide bombers fought for a greater cause. The segment was completely the subject, and considering Chahine's lack of decency, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie with their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
