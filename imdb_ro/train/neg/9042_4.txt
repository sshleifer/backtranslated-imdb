I wanted to like this movie. But it collapses in the middle. the whole premise is good and connects nicely, but the middle leaks tangentially. The people I was looking at were upset while running on the road and hoping it would end faster than she did. Another person actually fell asleep during the middle segment! I found myself dreaming somewhere else during the Schtick plays that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for eye candy and gave it to me, but she misses the writing and soul of Pixar. I think kids 8 and below will enjoy strolling in front of the valet, while missing the plot. People who are old enough to follow a plot will find themselves wondering too far to return quickly and easily. Edit most of the middle section, do it for 50 minutes and it would be a solid shot. I wish I had better things to say. But I do not know
