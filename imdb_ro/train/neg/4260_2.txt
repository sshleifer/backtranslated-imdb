Yes, OK. I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to take off. It was boring horrible and consists of most of the people riding randomly around the hills without an apparent direction. Then the hero gets into the picture. Born as an Asian, but when she grew she became white. Obviously, white. It was not too close to go to Asia. It looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and the story did nothing to help the cause. Unnecessary battle successes and blade dialogue. It's an hour and forty-five minutes, and by the end I was trying to eat my face. I looked at this because the people in the video store I'm working on always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It happens like this: ahem. "NOT GOOD GOD IS NOT HORRIBLE! DO NOT DO YOU TO YOU. We recommend another movie, maybe one that will be fun."
