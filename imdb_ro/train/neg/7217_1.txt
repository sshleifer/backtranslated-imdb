I just looked at this DVD home. We love Westerners, so my husband rented it. He apologized to me halfway. Stitches, costumes, accents - everything was stopped. The part that made me so crazy is where the guy did not shoot the collector with his bow and arrow while taking the fat of the soul. His only excuse was "he had only two arrows." I've watched everything and, as somebody else said ... too many bad things to identify any reason to suck. I mean, the fact that the boy beat the bad stone from the collector the same month and the day he was found, why? And why was it a grave court in which all died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still walking around? If you want a movie to have fun after a few beers, it can be your movie. However, if you want a true Western, you will hate this movie.
