When we think of Captivity, many minds come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, uninterrupted, insensitive, insensitive, impenetrable and undiscovered. I used to hate those movies from the middle to the late nineties, which were essentially Scream riffs, but these new knokkoffs Saw start to make these movies look like classics. They continue to face the same demographics that other films have been successful, but now adds a new level of degeneration that makes girls from twelve to fourteen feel like they are hardcore and hip. br /> <br /> This movie is a load of dull nonsense! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was still surprised to see that it has something to do with something bad! Was anyone surprised when the interest of the film turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did not anyone know when they saw him for the first time? Only someone who has never had a life in his life has ever seen another movie!
