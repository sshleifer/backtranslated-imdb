I stayed in one night and I was bored very much around 02:00, so I flipped through the channels and went to H.B.O. where this "classic" was playing. Originally I was happy that I caught something at first, but my happiness disappeared about two minutes in the movie. The whole film focused on an unattractive man who was afraid of females, four beautiful but naked women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's restaurant, and his extremely fat and extremely miserable cousin who was also working for dinner. There are some strange twists in this movie that make somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you have nothing to do for nights or just can not sleep, the medication works much better. However, boys there are plenty of skin, so it might be good to watch without the sound, but even that can become annoying
