I first saw live music at the Denver Fine Arts Center and it was absolutely amazing and amazing and had such a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked a lot more than most of the music I saw on the stage. Interestingly, you have NEVER seen Zach's face. He has always been in the dark, but his presence has been strong and has led the direction of all production. When I heard that I was making a movie from her, I waited with fierce breathing, but when I watched the movie version, I was so disappointed that I felt I was mistaken. The movie does not have the immersive state set in live production and never lets you be intimate with each character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again, and if I had to revive, I would strongly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. This will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
