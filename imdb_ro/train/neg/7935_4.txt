I blind bought this movie and I'm pretty upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say it deserves at least a rent for some cold deaths and laughing actors. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say I was pretty fun. I think it could be called so bad - it's fine. As I said, the action is terrible, I feel like I could do a better job showing at least any emotion. The story is nothing new and it's done better. I think I only have a bad spot for any carnival-esquire movie. I'd say to rent or download it, but you certainly do not buy it. It's not worth more than an hour.
