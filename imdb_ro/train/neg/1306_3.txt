(aka DEMONS III) Made for Italian TV, though filmed in English and never meant to be a sequel to previous DEMONS movies. It had to be simply titled "THE OGRE", so director Lamberto Bava launched it. An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams about herself, like a little girl who descends to the old cellar of this villa and faces this hump-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It shines and is covered with a spider and has what looks like a spider or insect feet hanging on it. It flows out what looks like green paint. Of course, the husband does not believe anything from that. The villa is just old and snoop and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should ignore it. But then OGRE itself appears in what looks like a kind of Centauri 16 suit with what looks like a wolf head attached to it and is attracted by the smell of orchids. The movies are not that bad, and at least the dialogue is halfway through the clever way without the stupid ridiculous phrases that dubbing would bring. There is no real gore, other than skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern pool. OGRE itself just fades after being driven by the Jeep Cherokee family. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD that I watched was flawed, the image becoming black for a few seconds about half an hour in the film, a defect I hope Shriek has corrected since then. The excerpt includes a brief interview with Lamberto Bava, explaining how there was a sequel etc ... etc, along with some trailers for other Shriek DVD versions. This is quite a standard thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
