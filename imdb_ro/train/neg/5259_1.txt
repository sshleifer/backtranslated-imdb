After we finished watching this movie, I was so upset that I wasted two hours of my life. That's two hours, I will not come back. Ugh. When you start this, you can think "Wow this is very good!" But make sure the first impressions do not mean anything. I was so excited about this movie to the worst end I've ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The actor is unhappy, the story line is only original and there is nothing particularly unique about it, except that it is MOVIE EVERY EVERYTHING! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! WARNING!! THE BEST MOVIE WILL WILL BE SORRY IF YOU HAPPEN 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE! 1/10
