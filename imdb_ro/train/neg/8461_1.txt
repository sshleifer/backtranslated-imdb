I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so strong for the money he was making to shame with such a shocking hit in this monstrosity. Hell: I'll donate the money I would send to Ethiopia if he's so desperate. I have never seen a movie so pathetic and disgusting for a long time ... who paid for it? They make some deceptive or insane taxes. A 5-year-old man would be ashamed of the plot, and I'd prefer to do cancer rather than spend more than the time I've suffered. All those involved should be jailed for a year in the sodomic wing of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give it a minus 10, if possible ... incredible.
