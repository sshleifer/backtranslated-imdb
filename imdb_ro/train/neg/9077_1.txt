If you enjoy movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; avoid at all costs this cinematic refusal. It is a loss of resources that should not be discussed out loud; much less recorded and sold by consumers who did not know anything. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; awesome bad for 86 minutes of his execution time. If there was much more, I could not have written this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!
