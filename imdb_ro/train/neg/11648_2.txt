As if there were not enough of them floating at that time, we have another GODFATHER bell from director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) that we saw earlier this year. The brand-value name at this time is Telly Savalas, who is late in the procedure and is seen for the first time in the back, rather usually holding her flowers and wearing a beret in the style of the French painters! Apart from the fact that he does not look very little Sicilian, he has no other accent than his familiar remarks. Antonio Sabato, then, makes an unlikely gangster - apart from being a leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in the eyes, is also unconvincing (especially that he later becomes romantically involved with her spirited adolescent granddaughter)! In addition, for a gangster blow, there is a precious action to talk about and none of them is memorable at all (although the finals set in a clinic are treated well enough); In addition, Francesco De Masi's score is useful, but nothing else. Besides, the DVD to rent the DVD that I rented starts midway between credits, so none of the casting members - or even the title of the movie - is ever listed!
