When I was at the movie store of today, I went to Blonde and Blonder, but something about it seemed like a nice movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people beat Romy and Michelle before seeing her, Blonde and Blonder could have been just another secret treasure that has passed. But when I started to watch it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, I knew I was in something scary. Not only that, but what was considered the culmination of the beast: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they are not aging at all, and they play roles that I think would be more destined for women who should be 20 years old, not 40 years old. The story was simply bad and inappropriate. Dee and Dawn are your stereotyped blonde beyond stupidity, have no clue when it comes to what's happening in the world, it's really really sad. But when girls are mistakenly mistaken for murder murders, policemen are in their story and call girls' geniuses because of their attitudes of "ignorance is happiness." They're ready to hit a guy and think they want to "look good," but the real assassin is checked and wants to kill the girls. > <br /> Denise and Pam looked very strange on the screen and almost read the script the day before. I know it should have been a bad comedy, but it was more than bad, it went awkward and it was just useless. Would I ever recommend you this? Not in a million years, girls are just trying to maintain their sex cat status, it's more a sign of despair, and Blonde and Blonde is a huge blonde BOMBshell. 10
