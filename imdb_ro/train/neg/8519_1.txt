I went to see this film based on the review of Siskel and Ebert; not only have I been deceived, but I've got some friends, and I had to spend the rest of the day with lots of excuses because I made them stay out of this stupidity. After that, I never went to see a movie based exclusively on Siskel & Ebert's advice.
