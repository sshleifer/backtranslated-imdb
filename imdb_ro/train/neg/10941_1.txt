WOW I can say. I like horrible movies and I'm going to watch an action movie, but the Snake Eater would rather have a knife in my hole, while my grandfather gave me a young dance. Lorenzo Lamas, more like Lorenzo Lameass, this guy has so many acting skills as Bill Clinton, who has self-control. He has all the goods to make a really bad and worse movie. Crazy Hillbilles YEP! useless (with a strange real scar) YEP! crappy soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie - 10 stars, but 1 is as low as it happens. Seriously I think someone was a joke on me when I saw that this can not be real ...... worse thing is 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES! ...... guess in his request.
