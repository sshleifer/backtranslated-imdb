It was really eagerly awaited this preview-based film and the press got it, but after seeing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally rude film, mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality, without Todd's humor. The story pulls along and each scene is worse than the last one. Perhaps I missed my point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's growing experience, I'm glad I'm a man.
