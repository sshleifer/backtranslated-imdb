Yes, we've rated this movie as a terrible star. However, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. It's really so bad that it's good. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: buying a really cheap / bad Mexican film, spending the zero money by getting him called in English and releasing him at his kidnapped midwives in the mid-1960s.) It's a sin like I've come across so late because I'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make this experience even better. I will not redo what many other commentators have already said, a Merlin Christmas movie, the Devil, some mechanics and some of the most pitiful actors I've never seen. I'm going to take her vacation back with Kelsey Grammar "A Christmas Carol". Really a holiday experience made in Hell. Now if I can only find "To All A Goodnight" (shortly "A To All A Goodnight") on DVD I will have a triple feature that can not be beaten. You have to watch this movie. It moves so slowly that I defy you not to touch the redirect forward button - especially on the two dance routines! This is like an expensive bleached cheese - guess you have to get over the smell to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
