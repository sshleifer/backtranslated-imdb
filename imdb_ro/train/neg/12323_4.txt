As many agree, Origin is a beautiful artistic anime. The music, graphics and the world created are superb and are indeed over most modern animation works. However, if you are looking for more than this, than I suggest you look elsewhere if. Beauty does not have its look anymore, and when it comes to plot and characters, there is nothing special. Action is slow and minimal, and people are full, sometimes horned and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there ... So in summary, oh my goodness, I have never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and my goodness, it's like ... people do not behave like this. It took a GIANT step forward in terms of graphics and anime music, but it also took a few steps back in moments of bad characterization and unfortunately there is not even much action to do so. .
