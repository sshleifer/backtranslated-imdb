I was so disappointed with this show. After hearing and reading all the hoopla about it, as it was a "show on the ground" and all sorts of wild promises if it's quality, I tried to look at it. The actor was forced and exaggerated. The story made little sense. Regarding any suggestion about "looking at adolescent life," I could only see an unpleasant attempt that had as much reality as a real show. Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it really is not all that good and beat drums over quality in this show serves only to draw attention to how badly it has been.
