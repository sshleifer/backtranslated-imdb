"Man in the Bridge" is a film set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really did not have to be told. Looking at the box, the people responsible for packing the film tried all that stood to make this film look hot and erotic. They use terms such as "illicit passion", "forbidden business" and "unlimited pleasures." They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) who owns a weapon! The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns her own business. Edward (Harris) is employed in her husband's company. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other. The "shocking" part of the movie is supposed to be: Krista's husband learns about the business and forbids them to see each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends with Edward living in their bridge. Wow! Krista gets to see someone else and Edward becomes extremely jealous. So and so on and so forth <br /> <br /> "Man in the attic" does not cover any new territory. It's an original picture from Showtime, which explains why the stars are a few actors in list B and both of them appear shortly in the mole. <br /> <br />
