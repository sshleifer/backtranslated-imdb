Viewed 18.06.2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): A strange psychotic film about a girl with autism that is being tested in a hospital, the power flickers, and then all the hell comes off. I'm not quite sure what the filmmakers were thinking about. What we get for the next one and a half hours (at least it was not) was a horror / twilight / zombie / ghost movie that really did not make any sense at all. Initially, after the power goes out, everyone is missing in the hospital, except for a small group of inappropriate cadres, including the girl and his father. There is the typically annoying character, a creepy old man and a typical tough guy like many girls and, of course, the young guy who attracts the main character. Random things begin to happen at different times, such as ghosts and monsters that appear, a suggestion that time has stopped and dead people, while this little group tries to get rid of everything they have. Of course, autistic girl is the center of all indeed hate the way they used this girl's pain and suggested that she was the cause and put her in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never find the answer to what is happening, which is very strange, so avoid this dog. Unless you want to be dragged and confused for an hour and a half this is not for you or someone to film. What a waste of time? Really!
