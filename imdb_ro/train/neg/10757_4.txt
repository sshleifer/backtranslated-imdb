I just saw this movie on DVD last night and I decided to analyze the comments this morning. It seems that "me, the robot" I polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and gave rise to a lot of insults and call-names, too). It seems to me somewhat surprising, because this is not great (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even very bad). What really is this movie is ... depressing. Depressing that the American film population is so ready to change, clich√© rehearses and appreciates them as spectacular new works. This film as "rewritten" written along it, from the plot line (an unpleasant mix of Asimov and uber-act of modernity) to the character of Smith (a smart cynic with a titanium backbone) to the special effects who borrowed from Matrix and a few others). "I, the robot" is, unfortunately, probably the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipid pitiful dialogue, and a lot of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but I already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has a lot of holes in it, of all sizes, but I do not think most people attracted to this movie are critical enough to observe. Perhaps a blockbuster of standards today, but very B-film versus true winners.
