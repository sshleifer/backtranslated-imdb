Phil Alien is one of those strange movies in which humor relies on the weirdness of everything rather than effective punchlines. At first it was very strange and funny, but as the movie progresses I did not find jokes or funny fun. A low-budget movie (this is not a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually I lost my interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this film would appeal to a stoner who is now part of it. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try "Brother on Another Planet"
