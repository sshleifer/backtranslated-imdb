When I bought my DVD, however, "It seems like a light comedy about love and relationships set up in Portuguese standards? Can we give her a chance?" I was ALL FALSE! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; is a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soaps! Secondly, is the plot so boring and not going anywhere? Has no structure, just flowing like the wind in one direction or another? Production is also bad! Mixing the sound is horrible, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. Did it remind me of some old Portuguese movies from the 1980s? Should it have been better? Well, to summarize, Portuguese cinema will not improve! In fact, it was one of the most serious Portuguese films I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad action, poor production? I did not have big hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Forget about this!
