If you saw Friends, writing will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy settings. The show is about a group of people whose link is that they shared the same class when they were still young (about 10 years old I think). Now I am twenty years old and meet again in a class meeting. Here's the series. A typical episode deals with several story lines at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into several sections, which are then presented in a mixed order. The sketches are where my problems are in this series. As in the later seasons of friends, it is often a rather stupid frame, with hard to believe situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid, hard to believe. The situation is then exaggerated, as if it were not stupid enough. If you are in such humor before you, then maybe you will love this series. It's a big stop for me. The reason I started looking at my friends is because of the first few seasons. There are exciting and incredibly credible story lines with a love story that makes you roots for the characters. The class has nothing of it. Characters are simply forced, and stereotypes are pushed too far. Therefore, it is not possible to relate to them and just like them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before it came out of steam, and the character's features were licked. But in the classroom, it seems to have come out of steam before it even begins.
