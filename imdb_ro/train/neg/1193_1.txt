Do you know how sometimes you can watch a bad movie with your friends and laugh at all of the film's flaws? Well, that was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie you could laugh at. In fact, it's not pathetic at all. About 30 minutes in the film, my friends asked me to stop him. About 45 minutes asked me. After an hour, we compromised to hurry to the end, so we could see how the conflict was solved (and because we were watching Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It's beyond pain.
