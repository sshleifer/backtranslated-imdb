Although he received a favorable press after playing in Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much of this. One - is a very low Canadian film. Two - they are written, directed, and have the same person (usually a bad sign if it's not Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But, despite looking at her with low expectations, it turned out to be a much greater disappointment than I thought it was possible. In short - a bad scenario, a bad action, a terrible direction! Do not waste your time or money on this turkey. It's supposed to be a comedy, but I laughed only twice. In addition, there is terrible music around the world. How will I have any attention that I will never know.
