Apart from the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious bastard, his performance is terrible. Nothing about Lopez has ever been fun. I watched his stand-up and I never said any resemblance to a laugh. His things meet as a vindictive, and his animosity towards the white people scatters from every poison of his body. <Br /> <br /> We laughed at white jokes from many comedians and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a prey that will not end. <br /> <br /> They feel bad for Hispanics, who have just this show to represent themselves. The plots look are always a cookie cutter with a Hispanic accent. Canned laughs at the worst comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> It might be why this show is always at 2AM in replay.
