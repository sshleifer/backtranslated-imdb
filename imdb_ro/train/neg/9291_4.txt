I can not believe that NO from the official reviews for this film warns people that it contains two pretty sexually assaulting scenes. It is as if our culture accepts this behavior as simply sexual but not violent. The biggest problem with my film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as if the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressed never keeps the men responsible for their actions and no one else. A man is stopped from the end of the assault when someone throws it with a dagger, but he is reprimanded only by "you can not force a woman to love you" rather than "you do not have to force a sexual woman, you are stinging." .. a woman's point of view, the film is disappointed. It is a kind of "throwing a bone" for women, allowing them to be both skilled fighters and leaders, but the film is more defined by romance - characterized by the idea that human sexuality must imply an imbalance of power, the woman the one I love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use any of his fighting skills to try and remove the attackers. She never makes them apologize - rather, she seems apologetic. All in all, a depressing and upsetting film with great cinematography and some cool fighting scenes, but not as good as Hero through a long shot.
