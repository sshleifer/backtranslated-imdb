Daraar started at a good start. The first scene left me at the edge of my chair, wondering what would happen next. Besides, the first half of the movie is BORE. The first half of the movie is about Rishi Kapoor falling on the heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think she's a little old for her? Things eventually start moving to the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what crazy he is! He was a strange protector, neat, with a very warm TEMPER! He used to beat Juhi poor for no good reason! One of the reasons why I do not like this movie is that I can not stand seeing Juhi (my favorite actress) so abused. This movie generally has too many abuses and bloodshed; I find it so bad !!! Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking of renting Daraar, you should put it on the shelf where you found it and choose something else!
