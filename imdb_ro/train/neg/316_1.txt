This film is by far the worst film ever made. If you need to create a film to cherish the guy who plays Lars in heavy than not to fucking movie. I have to say that I could look at the Leprechaun in space six times before I could watch the trailer for this SOP of a movie. Adam sandler should be restricted from any film after this shame. Watching this movie is like a mixture of listening to Cher and willingly put the dick in a blender. Anyone with half the brain cell will realize that this film does not deserve a penny. If I had one extra dollar and I had to spend it, I would give Lorraine Bobbitt support before buying this movie.
