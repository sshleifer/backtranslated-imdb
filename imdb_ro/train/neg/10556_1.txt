This is a good example of not making a movie. There is very little significant dialogue, no context for constant events and reductions between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused spectator, flawless; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's commentary. This film has much to do with human atrocities and tries to show how wrong it is, with a focus on child abuse. This includes a series of images of real, horrific violence, including wartime executions. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak or slightly offended stomach, and should in no case be shown to minors. The climax is anti-climate compared to the rest of the film. If he does not listen to the comment as it happens, he will probably miss it. The director's comment was one shot, "sit down and let him talk without any cuts" of comment type. While this is not necessarily bad, the director ends a lot and often spends a few minutes at a time complaining about college, shooting conditions, co-productive producers, bad movie and other dozens of things. Constant neglect weakens from what else is an essential tool for understanding the film. The film was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 films over a four-year period at a very low budget. Because of this, video and audio quality is poor. Only this does not make a bad movie, but makes a bad worse movie.
