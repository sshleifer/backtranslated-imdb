This was a wonderful book, and the possibilities for a really great movie were definitely there. But casting decisions have completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a great actor to be sure, but he does not have the all-powerful, moral ambivalence required for his main role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. Putting Melanie Griffiths, for the reasons candy eye, is understandable, but again, she did not portray depth or ambivalence, so you have to get this out. /> <br /> This movie is an extraordinary example of how each decision, even those at the beginning of movie production, can make or break a file.
