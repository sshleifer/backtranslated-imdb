Rosie lost a lot of television time talking about Tainos as if they were very influential in the modern day of Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen, looking like black chickens (with an obvious black father, a cousin and aunt), pretending to really recognize the real essence of what makes them Puerto Ricans, but just mention the way in which Africans influenced the way Spanish is spoken, food and music. It is so typical and I have lost much respect for it and will not support anything else. Also, since he wants to dance around the African, he does not need to take more roles associated with black (ie Lackawanna Blues). We can proudly find Black Latina next time (thank you Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). In Puerto Rican here, who said they were African and not "black." ...thank you. We "black" certainly have nothing in common with "you", so there is no lost love. But since you are probably in the States and you have benefited from the Civil Rights Movement, we would like you to refuse any decent human treatment, you received the courtesy of blood, sweat and tears behind the "blacks" that you do not share with. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, Puerto Ricans has a terrible image in the media, but we do not spend the time trying to respect ourselves because we know that the media likes to exploit the low points and the behaviors of everyone minorities to maintain generalizations without a mind. However, obviously you were nourished that one of you is somewhat white or superior ... you are not. You also feel obliged to believe that the black culture is BET ... again, you are wrong and you have to make a holiday out of the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Believe me, none of these blacks want to claim your "culture" as well.
