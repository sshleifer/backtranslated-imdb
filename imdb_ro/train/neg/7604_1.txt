Of course it's in the west, but the title makes it look like a conventional western. Instead, it's a sheriff's movie. Do not make a mistake though it's a bad movie about a sheriff woman. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is shot; she's just a little upset about it. Its main purpose is to go after the villain who is a woman, but the bastard hires a guy to kill her. This is how the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. It was stupid that anyone killed in this movie, the new sheriff thanks him. He was more likely to put the killer behind bars, but I think because he liked he would not do it. Criminal is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons also quite bad. This movie is very boring and not worth watching ... it's not one of the best episodes of the MST3000 they've done. I can not imagine anyone seeing it without them, because that would make it much more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but he really should know better than make people go in one place and get out.
