I gave more than 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and they caused a thought and a comment from my wife and myself. The actor and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess that I came out of the sensation of having been beaten up with God, this is God and Christ is our Savior. The film and story line do not need it. If, as I am, you are a Catholic or Christian recuperator, avoid doing so will make you nauseous. The film did a good job of demonstrating the thin line of being a good citizen and how one could become a stalker potential focused on what might have been.
