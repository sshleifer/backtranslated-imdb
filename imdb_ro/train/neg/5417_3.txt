Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decay of Monte Carlo, despite being at their last franc. To support their generous lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use the notes at casinos, hoping to change the coin for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, a US envoy, arrives to Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make friends with the visitors, hoping to receive financial assistance. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, intends to go further, advancing continuously towards Helen, disappointing the maid of the Count, who loves Sergius. Eventually, circumstances turn their hand against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim is trying to convey a message (with the foolishness of American women and the inappropriate behaviors of the aristocrats) rather than telling a story, and the film can simply easily carry modern audiences like me. Even the act, which is great in EvS later as Greed and Wedding March, is just a run of the dead here. The film could have used improvements at different levels. Rating, 3.
