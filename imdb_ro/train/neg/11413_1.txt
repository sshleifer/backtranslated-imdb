Seriously - Avoid this movie at any price. I just saw it in my first "sneak preview" and although I paid non-refundable money, I left the cinema in just 15 minutes. Which already includes 2 minutes of talks between my friends whether or not to leave. The first time I left a movie. And I lived through some pretty bad. It is one of those films that is called (and badly so) even if it is presented in its original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. On the military ("What do we do when we get to the battlefield?" - "You got out of the car and you die," it's actually more fun to read here how it was delivered), about drugs eating "sparse cookies", behaving really stupid and losing his wedding or having to live through it while it is tall - all written and misdirected) on women in the army ("Why do we just have trumpets? weapons ! "-" That's right, it will stay ") ... Argh. Okay, you could even find these things really funny, but in this case I'm really scared. In addition, I have seen a better action in the soft porn movies you get on European TV late at night. So, he had bad jokes (delivered poorly), beyond the lower average, no rhythm, was insufficiently called and edited? It simply did not work. At least not at any level used as a measure for movies. I would be so bold to say that this movement demonstrates that there are people who can be far less friendly than the Germans. And that says something if you like stereotypes. (What I do not have, it's nice to play with them, though, if someone thinks I'm not much for PC.) Instead of watching this movie, do something useful. Try to learn shrimp on shrimp, paint your toes in a very irritating color, disassemble your bike, change bulbs, understand Einstein's theories, transform yourself into another religion and backward - actually , go and listen "to Wham! on endless repetition Anything, but do not look at this terrible blow.
