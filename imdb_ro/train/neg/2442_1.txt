I do not know why I'm doing this for myself! I defend myself in defending the Dutch and Belgian cinemas and claim that they should gain more credit and chances ... and then you knock around your junk head like that! Intensive care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing they have ever done in Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, clearly based on the classic American mainstream slasher such as Friday, 13 and Halloween. Producers and writers have been very much focused on this, but have fallen very little. Intense care has become an embarrassing product for anyone involved, and therefore a real cult hit here. It's almost impossible to hunt an original copy of this, and it's only shown on special occasions such as "The Night of Destruction." For exactly 5 minutes, intensive therapy tries to tell a story and even create a plotline ... then turns into a low-lame and low-drain film with damaging effects but very hilarious and cheap. The action of the entire distribution is abominable, even if there are some respected names. The main role of the man is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy could be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. She is a beloved singer, a series of TV shows and an idol of many young girls. He never mentions this in which he played. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he's trying to convince that intense care has never happened.
