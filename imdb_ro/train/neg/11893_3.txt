** May contain Spoilers ** A guy in a dopey Kong costume outfit (the same used in KING KONG VS GODZILLA in 1962) offers much of the laff in this angry monster monster movie. Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps the meadow hero and other good guys this time. The vampire bastard is called Dr. Who - funny, does not look like Peter Cushing! Finally, the Kong goes with Who's Pride and Joy, a gigantic robot monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Gorilla Magilla. Like many of Honda's films, this could have merit in front of the American audiences who headed for it and added new images. The Rankin / Bass animation company has had this mess. She should have stayed at high school programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
