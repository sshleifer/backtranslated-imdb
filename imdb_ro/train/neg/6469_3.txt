When I was younger, I thought the first movie was very good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequences because the first movie is usually the best and it is. Basically, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed outside the house because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the octopus bastard in movie 1), and Morgana gets to her. When the child comes out, she asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, like her mother. This makes Ariel return to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists are just the story that might have thought a little longer. Suitable!
