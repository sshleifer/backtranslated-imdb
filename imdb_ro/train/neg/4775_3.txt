What a total loss of time. The film begins as a Saw clone, but with a worse action. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The conclusion is ridiculous, and the story does not contain twists, no surprises of the plot and only a bad ending. I liked some characters and I hope everything is tied at the end. It just does not happen. It is a total "fighter" that does not end up with any good action. I can not believe I spent my time watching this. It is not "fun" as some people have said. A guy in the mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure out. The connection is a stretch and should have first shot the main actress.
