This film seems to start in the middle, introduces peripheral players as meaningful, and presents main characters without substance and subtle and / or impenetrable substrates on paper. Almost no one has a credible or discernable motivation for their actions in this film. The land is getting worse and, ultimately, it is not going anywhere, the dialogue is strange and lived, and the director has a small concept to get the best out of his actors. Almost feels the first half of this movie, but it has never been done. We were told that a mysterious pyramid appeared over New York and that Central Park became inexplicably an Arctic desert. However, none of these seem to have caused much agitation among the general population and is just a minimal concern for the government. We are presented with the "evil corporation" in Eugenics, but that is indeed a good idea to populate the universe with a couple of sluggish servants. The whole double-entender "Eugenie-is-bad" is hard to handle and never has any effect. We should care about the central characters, but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped, that it comes like a fatalistic rationality of 1 hour, 40 minutes for rape. In the animated digital animated world created here, all I can say is that at about the same time as this movie was made and other executives did the same thing with better and more credible results. After spending time watching this movie remained the most problematic issue in my mind was, "So what?"
