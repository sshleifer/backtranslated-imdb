I'm pretty sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can not make a 13-year-old boy laugh at stupid humor, you should quit comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of which are racist) and very unlucky jokes. It is a particularly memorable scene where the doctor says the main character has died and that he is pregnant (as I write, I can not believe that this was actually a movie scene). The man is hurrying to a dead rabbit on the doctors' desk and trying to get his mouth open. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punch line that tells you how bad they are in this movie is "I knew I should have been on top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
