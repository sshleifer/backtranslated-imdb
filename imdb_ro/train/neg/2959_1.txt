No matter what someone says, there is a simple fact about the word "possession" in movie circles - such as "what did you possess to light this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but the common sense has. That is, if your head is clear and you have the healthy mind to make a judgment. At many levels I've been trying to rationalize where this movie would be fun ... or even the average consumer would be interested. The star? The story? The unique idea? A friendship movie that children will love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On my goodness! I'm sure when it was an "idea," it sounds good. But somewhere in the course of development ... someone should have pointed out where the idea can not translate into a piece of entertainment that someone would want to follow or pay ... unless they were very much under the influence alcohol or drugs and I saw something that others could not see. Regardless, this is a complete mess. Misery, misery - sin and misery. Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a salary, but I would have been ashamed to take it. I hope she fired the agent / manager / publicist for this career move. Obviously not, he made several bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
