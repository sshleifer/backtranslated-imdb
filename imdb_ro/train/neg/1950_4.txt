I grew up with scooby (just re-run where you are) I hate disorderly, I love Daphne and I feel it's not complete with the whole gang. But this is sad, scooby doo is the mystery of solving the comedy - it's not totally evil spy's anime jap. I love "what's new", had to give Daphne a dangerous threat once and try to lose sex sex jokes for several generations, but this "get a clue" is a flat shit and should not have the name scooby attached, even tried to do a punk blade thing with song theme now i'm going to watch my scooby doo DVD where to wash the mess of this new series from my eyes
