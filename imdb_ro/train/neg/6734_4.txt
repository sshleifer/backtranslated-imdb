I've found this movie to be a great idea that she did not offer. They seem to have found a way to create suspense, but they could not make good payments. In one case, the police are about to find the kidnappers hiding. They go from dentist to dentist to fit a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. Once built, the police arrive at the same time, becoming free, which is very little anticlimated. There are also great narrative scenarios that take us "inside the mind" of the terrified husband and wife, which weakens them rather than suspense and does not add it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice is an insult and breaks the spectator with any chance of personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has done from time to time, is more effective. The biggest disappointment is to stay on the whole movie and get the end fast, quite bland. I mean ... "ends" in a snore.
