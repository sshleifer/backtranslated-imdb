I love a lot of actors / actresses involved in this project, being so insulted by feeling even worse than using an unknown one. The main problem was that this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers. 30 years, the NBC will probably make a movie just like the early 1990s. I can now see a black family in which children are involved in riots, and the white family has rebellious children and listening to rock grunge music. The soundtrack will include bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. that it will be as brown as 60 years old and I guarantee you NBC will do this. You see the biggest problem with the parts of the period when you are buying networks is that when you live in a certain period of time do not think live in the 1960s or any decade is trendy retro at that time. Later, someone doing something like this should put more weight there
