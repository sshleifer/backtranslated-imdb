If you read my review of "Dinoshark" SyFy, you know I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these movies made for television can offer. I'm stupid ... they're stupid ... but they're still pretty fun in a kind of "so bad, it's good." So, still blaming for having liked (and recommended) "Dinoshark", no doubt hokey, I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy," a SyFy movie about a half-and-a-half hammer monster terrorize on an island. With the SyFy channel security recipe for creating B-Movie creatures and a distribution that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, I really miss the mark ... not long, but enough to make me do not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, the awful hammer-human hybrid, takes a back in behind for a bunch of fake-military thieves who really become the main character of the movie. Although the hammerhead does not deal with the number of corpses, it (or whatever you call the thing) comes just before someone is eaten and left immediately after. The rest of the film is filled, putting our heroes against the soldiers mentioned above. This, for me, is not as convincing as watching a hammer walking people eating! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
