The Polish reviewer must be a feminist because he finds "Young Catherine" to be a great and accurate film. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I have made an exception from the YC at almost every turn, and in particular the political correct representation of her as the head who, with one hand, a direction of domination. Truth? She was brought to St.Petersburg to be a wife and mother and found she had to "get involved" with the court, the boyars, and the army just to survive. As long as she did not, she was able to satisfy her cultural wishes (filling Hermitage with her art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "wonderful," but in this area of ​​post-modern revisionism, proof is not very popular. YC is just a dramatic costume, a bit of a Ted Turner fluff that, like 1986's "Peter the Great," is another example of how bad Russia is in the West.
