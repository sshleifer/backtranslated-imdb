Under the dense green light of computerized graphics, Ichikawa Somegoro's stunning art and grace shone. Unfortunately, it's lost all over the world. Old Edo's scenes - with the courtesan, floating on Sumida, repeating and acting in Nakamura-za - were exciting and full of enthusiasm, leading back to an exciting and rich epoch. The action on the Kabuki scene, where Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriched than any of the greatest absurdities that followed. The ability, the public energy, the colors of the sets were more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over the plot and the performances. What a missed opportunity! One of Kabuki's best actors is alive and he's lost in the galleries.
