I still read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I wanted to do for a while. I'm sure it has to be more frightening than this movie. I remember jumping once when I watched him the next day, though I do not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are wonderful and I watched this on DVD, but I'm sure the theater must have been a wonderful sight. After the first few special effects are made, we are expecting a story to develop. I thought this movie at least must be based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it was not. I was downgraded to look at the wonderful character Catherine Zeta-Jones in the movie, basically because there was nothing else to look at. Lili Talor was such a sucking character. I did not like a little, some damn people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to characters at all. Quigon, ah Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with a kind of action. <br /> <br /> Half to three-quarters of the way I just went to see a plague on Friday 13 or a Scream Queen movie! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story, at least they fill it with evil death or attractive females. This has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br />
