If I had created a film thermometer, this movie would be absolutely zero. Of the ten stars, I would have rated as follows: Plot: Zero stars Video quality: Zero stars Sound quality: Zero stars Act: Zero stars <br /> <br /> It's as if high school students gathered together afternoon with a camera, made a plot and filmed a movie. It is so deprived of any artistic value I would prefer to look at children who walk around a high school than to watch this movie. However, something must be said about the depths of the abyss. "Fighting" on the ladder is one of the funniest scenes of a train. First of all, combatants simply throw plastic pistols on each other, pulling their arms back and forth to simulate the rebound. The pair actually "duck" bullets nonexistent. No sparkle, no sparks, no fur, just blowing spraying around scratches. If you want to see two adult men playing "actor", make a move one day ... after cleaning the fridge, combing the carpet, polishing all the door hinges, grabbing the gravel, directing the books on the shelf, etc. .
