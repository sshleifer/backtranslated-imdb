George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heir. She is supposed to be the heir of a cream fortune. He intercedes on her yacht. They fall into each other in swimsuits. It seems (quite early) that he is not an heir. She is part of an advertising campaign for cold cream. The film follows the ups and downs of their romance. The support distribution does not do much to lift it. Davis and Brent bear the image. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite fun. It's far from the best. But especially because of its obscurity in her work, it is not one of the worst.
