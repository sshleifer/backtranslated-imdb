This movie could have been much better with rewriting a script. Not that I expect a great plausibility in the movies, but you think even homeless people and locals in the area, Jack Mason, would ask why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And when he gets to the hunting ground, the poor Ice-T plays his role as if to actually lead these people through forests he has never seen before. And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle? suppose this movie is based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after reading the story. I re-edited the movie, eliminating all the useless scenes and all the profanity. It's up to 43 minutes.
