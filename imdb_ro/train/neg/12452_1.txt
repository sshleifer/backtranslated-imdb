This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What's the scary pit with writers, producers and the director? How did they get money on earth for this abomination? The plan is ridiculous, the actor is the worst, the story ... What story? The first battle in this movie is fine, but then repeats itself until you want to stop it. I think I'm the greatest free because I do not move the bad movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** I just saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and he's in it ... for 30 seconds. .. I gave it 1 in 10 because it is the lowest grade IMDb has to offer. Do a favor: See a Uwe Boll movie in exchange ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
