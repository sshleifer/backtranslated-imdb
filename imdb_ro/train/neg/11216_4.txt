The movie is fine about a woman who is a twin who has disturbing visions about her sister in danger back home. She then returns home to find everything is not good and she will have to find out what happened to her sister and why. This is a kind of thing that works pretty close, but not enough. I can not put my finger on why it does not work, but it was good enough that I wanted to be better or at least to have the least things to do, like having girls who play twins in flashbacks be closer to size. I think maybe that's wrong with her, there are a lot of little things that are stupid.
