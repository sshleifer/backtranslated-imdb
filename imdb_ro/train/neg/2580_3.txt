well officially. they just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this and the others were awful. I want to say that the story is about two collegial brotherhoods fighting each other for their homes, I mean they come to talk about a weak plot, the first three deal with growth, change and marriage, which are all worthy of development in society human. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know she's trying to compare you to Steven Stifler, but there's no cigar. I give this movie a 3 movie, because there are 2-3 funny bits in the movie. The best character in this movie is, of course, Jim's father, I do not know why they continue to do these stupid films developed.
