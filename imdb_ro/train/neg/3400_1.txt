This film is self-indulgent garbage. Watch this movie if you just want to hear gaelic talk or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but it is not - it's just irritating. The characters are hard to handle and the act is weak. Stories in the film are also charmless and sinister. I was expecting a family movie, but my fourteen-year-old daughter was also not called. It's rare that I do not see a movie until its end, but this was the best of both. Although the film is established in the present times, it has the look of an inexpensive East European film made during the Cold War. There is not even enough in the way of the beautiful Scottish decoration and cinema to redeem it. A real shame because, as a film, this is an embarrassment for Scotland.
