After a few years of weakness, 1968 was a bit of a bloated time for Elvis: not only did he celebrate Comeback TV Special, but he also became a father and played in two pretty good movies as well. SPEEDWAY and live a small, love a little. Therefore, I can personally forgive him for the mistake STAY AWAY, JOE, which, best, appears as an interesting fire and is not so bad. Sure, Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell are really embarrassing? as a loving Indian daddy of Elvis' character and a gentle bartender who also has the eye of Mr. Presley - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by Hollywood's top talent like Katy Jurado (the wife of Mexican Meredith), two Jones? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez, which is particularly funny as the young sarcastic Thundercloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father still dressed up the old captain's clothes nowadays! <br /> <br /> While there is a lack of surprising songs (if not unwanted, given their usual lack), there seems to be no lack of free parties for all, while male Indians have constantly hit the bottle, while Presley's practices his female skills behind them! As is to be expected, Arizona's "western" landscape is a major asset here, and sleeping sleeping snoring is not only a good one but a major park point. On the other hand, the "house destruction" episode is one we've seen too many times and does not work well here ...
