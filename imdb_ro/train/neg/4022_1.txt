This movie was horrible. I looked at it three times, not even everything. It's impossible to look, the story line sucks, it's depressing and absolutely disgusting. I do not write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his first dialogue and some funny parts of the film. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is silly. I saw this movie in movies around America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I'm wrong !!!! The actress is horrible, and the nudity itself is blatant and ugly. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the other main character, was not in such bad movies in the past, in fact, he was in some pretty good. Same thing with John Savage. This SUCKS movie!
