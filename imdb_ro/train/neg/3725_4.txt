This is an interesting treatment of a topic that is quite controversial (just read the other comments on this movie). Apparently, you like or hate it, and it seems that most people make this distinction based on the fact that they think the trouble and the final time will happen as it is shown in the film. In principle, the movie - and sequels - were made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are right there with "Plan 9 of the cosmic space," and the scenario is at the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (apology for Ed Wood). Leaving aside the religious message, the story is as frightening as they are. Add even the slightest thought that the story could be close to something that might happen in the future and become even more frightening. This film and its sequels have not tried to explain why the trouble happened when it happened. "He left behind," and the "Omega Code" tried to get everything that "Thief" did and explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to him. The net effect was "Thief" did a much better job on the scary part of the film instead of spreading too thin trying to explain what is happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, for what they are - horror stories. That could be horrible stories, indirectly said by God, makes them just so much more scary. If it makes you think about the subject, it did your job - even if you never believe it.
