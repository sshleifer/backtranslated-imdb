This may have been based on historical events and we know that the producers of this documentary drama have taken liberties to make them more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was so badly done! I was amazed in the event of an average air crisis as calm everyone seemed, surely someone would be panicked and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort - it appears! I'm not sure about the regulations, at present some airline security seems to be OTT fools, but why take your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me it's not a good idea! The photos of this massive airplane that went down this remote access track were not convincing and forged. In reality, it would have been a wonderful view from the ground nearby, in this movie it was disproportionate and it looked like the pattern was probably. In front of and in the middle of the emergency doors, evacuation slides appeared, but no one seemed to get out of the front, even if the decrease was much lower. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was caused by the lack of fuel, but even so there must have been a certain amount of fuel spiraling in the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion would have been a very real danger, yet the evacuation seemed to be almost easy and everyone is at the foot of the escape chutes instead of getting as far as possible, as I'm sure I would have done. There were too many inconsistencies, errors, and false actions in this regard. I would have liked to have seen a real-time drama representation, and the realistic movement of the portrayed plane. It had the potential to be quite thrilling, but no doubt due to budget constraints, it failed, and it was believed that a plane losing all the engines was not really a great thing and that you slipped safely to a unclear landing, but not real danger! - the reality, of course, being somewhat different!
