Another version and improvisation about the story of the famous and beloved children, La Bete (1975) aka Beast tries to imagine (in a very graphic image and what seems to be offensive and disturbing, but in fact quite stupid and comic) beast ? I am amused by many comments and comments that seem to look too profound in this movie. I would not go that far, saying it is a serious and dark exploration of topics such as sexual frustration, desire, fulfillment or satirical criticism of Catholic religion. I would not even call a horror-erotic movie. It is more of a parody of all genres it touches or mentions, even if it has shocking moments in all the departments that will remain in your memory. The long (too long) scene between a young woman aristocrat and the supposed horrible, but the most noisy which I have ever seen in the movie created with a really impressive ... well anatomy, is put on Clavichord's music at Scarlatti and it is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed aloud at the exact details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the movie? For an erotic image, it is too verbal; for an art film - it's too many scenes of madness and madness and I would say a steep end. IMO, the creator of the film did not want to be a serious drama. As a parody of the art / horror / erotic house, it is fun and definitely original. Laugh well and try not to look for a deep meaning. This story of curious Beauties and Poetry Sons is certainly not recommended for co-visualization with children. The opening scene that can shock an unprepared spectator much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be used successfully on the Discovery Channel for the program such as "In the Animal World - Mating and Horse Rituals".
