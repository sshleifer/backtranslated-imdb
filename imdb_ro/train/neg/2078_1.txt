I went to see this movie yesterday and, although I did not have much hope for this movie, I was still so madly disappointed! In fact, I do not think I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was THA bad! The story was shameful and the acting was terrible (even if it had big names like Uma Thurman in it). This movie relied heavily on its special effects ... but they personally had no effect on me. I really wanted the id never seen her and I warn them all against the fact that I do not see this movie. It is a total waste of money and you will only be disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, wear you, not go and see this movie ... You will live to regret lol!
