It is like saying the title of this thread. Only the impression I got from that film is that Marlee Matlin's character was always upset, so cynical and so pathetic. Her character, first with William Hurt's character, in which she danced, was stupid. On the whole, I tried to finish watching the movie four times and four times asleep. I would continue to watch the movie with one intent ... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all I do is fall asleep. Sleep well.
