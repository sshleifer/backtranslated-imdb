If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a classic evil worship movie, I might say it could have been a blow. Have you ever stayed and watched a movie that was so horrible that it gets fascinated from the point of view of its mistakes? Well, that's it. Everyone who acts as an actress must be nominated for the worst performance awards. It would be hard to find another film with such a production budget that would contain so little value. Everything in the opening scenes contradicts logic. The dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. This is the behavior and general story of the film itself. What is really proud of the mind is that some buffoons in a boardroom have made decisions to spend money on this piece of garbage. Wow.
