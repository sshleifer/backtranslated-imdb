There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm on them, are some like "Worldworld" that have the same unexplained draw as a car accident, and there are some such as "Desperate Lives" I like to admit you like it. Cowgirls do not have any of these redemptions. The assembled tower has enough talents to make almost any plot followed, and from what I was told, the book is pleasing. How could this movie be so badly intolerable? First, it seems that the director has reunited a distribution of names with no other tie than what he will bring in the 20 things. Then tell them to make the best imitations of Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and start taking photos of everything on the page, making sure you keep America's wide areas of interest in any way. Finally, give it the job of editing your father-in-law, because the meat packing facility just put it down. He has twenty years of cutting experience. This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not good to be bad.
