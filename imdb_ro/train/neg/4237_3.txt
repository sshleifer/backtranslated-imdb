JUDAAI was a bold movie by Raj Kanwar at his time In 1997, when such a subject came out of the box. To give credit, he manages to show how greed changes a person and to what extent a person can go to get what she wants The film is, however, damn melodramatic, many ridiculous places /> One wonders why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife? when he wins so much Just to show how poor he is? The twist is well handled, but the manipulation is directly from the 80s comedy Johny-Paresh who has fun here and there is remarkable as a thumb thumb pain as it does not fit into the story Even there are more many beautiful scenes Kanwar Raj Direction is appropriate but sometimes too melodramatic Music is fine but most songs look forced Anil is part of it well Sridevi is excellent in her part Urmila is decent Between rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritates Farida is decent
