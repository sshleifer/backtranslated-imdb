Massage fodder is just one of the most recent mediocre zombie films to be after hard-won dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard earned money and let's say the old Old Theater has got one for the team in this regard. Guess what are the plots? Zombie taking over. This time, for the sake of originality (?), This movie takes place in Rhode Island and, to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a Rhode Island-based zombie hit. A government-controlled television station is supposed to keep "normal" broadcasts so that all remaining citizens do not believe there is a problem in the world, that is, those who never look or do not go out. I will say, however, that some of the commercials broadcast by this post were probably the funniest part of this movie. There is, in fact, a story about it, but I do not mind because because you do not care after a while, or you have not asleep. In any case, this has a lot of terrible action to throw away everything "seen before" that rolls in front of the camera. Believe me, you can find a lot of other things about your time than watch this. 3 out of 10.
