Worse than the one granted. This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays: bad to act terribly, a script that is badly written and steady. From the opening scene where DeMille buries the set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the early stages, this film has Moses (who was Charlton Heston in DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) about a boy who was burying a box in the sand. The characters that were to represent the three icons mentioned above were terrible, and they had to resemble the people they were supposed to suppose. The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when one is injured and everyone calls for an ambulance. Clearly, the screenwriter ignores the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such a low quality.
