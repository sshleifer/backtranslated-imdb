Contains spoilers The film can be summed up in a few sentences: Three boys go to the forest. Two of them alongside others are shot in the head without explanations. The last guy can sit in the tongue, shout and do anything without being shot. He gets to go through an old factory and has bad people to go into his sphere without a fight. The villains are dressed in black and look like villains. This is the whole story, not summed up, but in detail. Everything is fired with a guy who stands when a door bell sounds. We wait with him. Long shot by boys being bored in the woods and sleeping. We can sleep with them. The one who shot her after a female jogger could have redeemed if we could see her ass or blood tits. Dialogue is less than Terminator and is not because there is so much action. Characters do not speak. And then they have not even something to say that "I'll be back". If my buddy shot this thing at the weekend, I would have cheered up for him, because it's good to figure out the camera controls. To pay money to rent this as a DVD is totally inappropriate. The only thing that is a bit funny is, in addition, with the director, saying how the local police did not realize they were shooting and treating them as a casual guy who walks with a gun. If he had shot this, I'd be sure it would be more fun to watch the movie.
