All I can say after seeing Snitch'd is that you stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you do not understand what you are doing about movies. If you insist on making gangster movies, I urge you to do research. It's funny to look at absurd gangbangers, which sounds more absurd when they talk. I laughed at my side when Mr. Cahill went to a school with just 3 students and started to hit his ass in kung fu fashion. This movie was hard as a special school. Who had the idea of ​​wearing hats to say where a gangbanger was? I suppose the real gangbangers do not wear the hats that claim to have a band. That would be bad, considering new laws that add a length to the term of imprisonment if a person is connected to a tape. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the biggest gangbanger movie ever made.
