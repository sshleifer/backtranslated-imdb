How unfortunate to have so many of my "a" list and good actors on the "a" list agree to make this movie but they did, and that made me forget at her. I've never heard of this movie, but was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the cover of the DVD and James Woods in the background how bad can it be? In a Great Word! This movie begins o.k. has some twists and turns, then puts an egg. The end was so weak, it was as if the writer had been called out and his 4-year-old son sat down at the typewriter and shattered the end. How ironic is a movie titled "The Final Game," which has such a poor role. These are the types of movies that can move actors in the "b" list in a hurry. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not get used to this.
