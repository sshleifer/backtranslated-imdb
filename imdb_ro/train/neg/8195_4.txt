Every Christmas night, I make my children endure yet another show of "A Wonderful Life." I also enjoyed Bad Santa very well. So, sue me. Recognize. I like cheesecaps. I like the excellent, intelligent, but, like so many things, the variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without Ka-ching's annual Santa Claus movie, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not make anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I do not think a Christmas movie should get to the iconographic stature to succeed. "Fred" is a perfect holiday film, with enough adult humor and a charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even though most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a Santa Claus who helped a lot. It's not a great move, and it's unlikely to become mandatory for anyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed what was, I schmaltz holiday with a small drop of spice. There's nothing wrong with that.
