A very bad test on a vertebral valve. At least the music in the spinal tap was good. This is indeed a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at worst. A bunch of executives from Hollywood, musicians and bad producers create a "poopie" show so their kids can be the focus of attention. Oh please !!! The potter's humor was bad. I hate these things when there are truly incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who take their pockets to succeed, and this stupidity is coming. <br /> <br /> Help everyone !!! Why was not Gene Simmons in it ??? Ameriac's taste in entertainment is heading for the toilet.
