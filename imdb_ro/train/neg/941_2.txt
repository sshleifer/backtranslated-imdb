This movie is simply bad. It's not even worth looking to have fun with it. The crazy professor is simply annoying. Even the suspension of unbelief to allow for invisibility (which I am happy to do for the good of bad movies) and allowing extremely stupid victims in a horror film, this film asks even more. If you are looking for women's dressing room scenes and random sexual encounters, get a porn, if you are looking for a good movie, you get something else. If you want to waste your time in a bad movie, rent it.
