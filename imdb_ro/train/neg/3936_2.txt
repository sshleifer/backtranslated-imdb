Wow. I thought this could be insipid, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car-crash" movie: those that are so bad you can not look away because you want to see how bad I can get. That's the only reason I could leave the fascinating television morbid. It was not so much the actor, who was only mediocre or a little worse than he expected from this distribution, but the premise and plot that should not have seen the light of day. The scenario is also the induction of the jam. As for cinema, someone else noticed that they were using a "curtains" perforation device, like in a television show 50 years old ... but without irony? At first I thought I had to joke, but the movie takes seriously to use it in a clear manner. Do not even ask me about the score ... the only high point is the final piece by Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people with something for $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has encountered difficulties in finding too much work recently? I think if you do not wait too long and want to watch a wonderful thriller, it would be better to spend an evening with your feet, so it's worth 2.
