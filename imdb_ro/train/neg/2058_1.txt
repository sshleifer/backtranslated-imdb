I can find very few good things to say about this movie. I'm sure the idea and the script looked good on paper, but the filmography and the role I'm afraid of are not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt this is very important in their resume. Michael Caine sometimes came from wood in his role as a doctor, and at no time did I believe in his character. The plot was incredible especially for the victim's son. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that sometimes I wonder if it's actually a spoof thriller. Enlightenment was sometimes dark, and this was added to the feeling of watching a low-budget movie with some big stars called, wondering why I was disturbed to see it at all.
