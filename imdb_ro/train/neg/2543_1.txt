we are talking about the waste of money .. I just wonder why Michael would play in such a turkey of a movie ... Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie in which a dying man plays a cancer. wonderful. while he registers for his son to see him once he grows ... Michael is such a talented actor ... so what made him do that? I saw it and I thought it was really stupid. I think at some point in their career they have these terrible movies .. especially "The Squeeze" I did not understand that I ever had and feel the best performance he's been in "Pacific Heights," his character really dragged me .. and I really enjoyed "Multiplicity." . That was so bitter !!! and he was just Perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I liked "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too .. too bad some of them get to make terrible movies .. like this was. ..
