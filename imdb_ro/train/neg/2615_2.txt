I do not know why, but for some reason, I think since I was in Disney game, I decided to go and see 102 Dalmatians. The first movie that was a remake of the classic Disney cartoon, with Glenn Close, like Cruella De Vil, seemed a safe shot, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies do not work is because 101 Dalmatians, the original, was a cartoon, it worked better and was more appealing to both children and adults. That was not so much fun because the adults who move around, trying to behave as cartoons instead of human beings, understand that they try to make sure it's appealing to kids, but it's ridiculous to see how which these actors act in the film. The story of 102 Dalmations is not that good. Cruella De Vil has been shut for a while, but things change when it turns out he now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now affected as a puppy, but she buys a shelter for men and is suddenly loved by everyone and seems to have changed. But when she sees Dalmatians of probation officers, she gets mad and begins to see spots, and she loses her. She returned to revenge for the puppies and is still determined to get the cute coat she always wanted. Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very underestimated, but she's taking Cruella De Vil, it's good, but let's do it, this movie made the bastard fun just a bad nut case. Also as cute as a puppy, it works more for animation, it sounds bad, but it's not as credible without the cartoons and their personalities being in the mix. I would not really recommend 102 Dalmatians, it's good, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, that's the same.
