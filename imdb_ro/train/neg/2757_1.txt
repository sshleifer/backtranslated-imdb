I'm a guy who loves movies ... I'm looking forward to seeing a dragon struggling with the special effects army. All this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The story was standard, but the portrayal of the story was terrible. The transitions of the scenes were the worst I've ever seen. Why would you go to a beach to relax if your life was in jeopardy? The actions of the dragon itself were poorly written ... and dragon's attack capabilities varied throughout the movie, several times the main characters would have to die. The director tried to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful, this movie was not obviously seen after it was done, I like movies, but I had to force myself to finish seeing it, thank God I did not buy this, borrowed it from a friend <br /> <br /> Do not buy this, do not rent it, just watch the discovery channel ... much more interesting.
