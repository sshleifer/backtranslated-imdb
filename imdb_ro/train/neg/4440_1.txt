Let me be clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But only today we went through the trouble of recording on the site, so we could give this film the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some bad, some terrible. I have never seen such a pretentious contrast, as well as incompetence, intentions and high failures. Mira Sorvino is horribly expressed as a princess, but totally unbelievable as Phocion, a little boy. Fiona Shaw is always a fun character, but the dialogue in the movie is much worse than the insipid French song that is the source (Marivaux has not reached Hollywood so far and we should keep it that way) <br /> illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant and passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown to feed freely with chemicals from glass to glass, shouting the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even stronger. For this, the pair should receive a "Clair Danes" joint prize, which, in a just world, would have been granted for the anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teenagers in the literature as a brats of the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to atrocious plotting and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into filming. For example, there are times when a handful of viewers are blurred and out of action, sitting in chairs, watching the main characters. The director wants to realize he adapted a piece. I see. But it does not happen at all until the movie. At that moment, seeing a lot of people sitting on the chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is frightening and distracting. They are like crowds of zombies without sparkles that appear in the fog, filling us with fear. When you see the horrible song and the melody that concludes this movie, you'll want to provoke a lot of zombies and kill everyone for the injurious injustice of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. -Matthew McGuire
