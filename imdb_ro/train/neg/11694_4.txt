So "Thinner" ... Yeah ... This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) about a man who takes only the desserts from a young gypsy he just killed, The story itself is there, no doubt but not I do not know why I did not enjoy more than I could have. I think what a bit of fun at me was the actors. Which is the leader? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And happy shouting out loud, can someone please stop employing Joseph Mantegna for every Italian mafia role ever? And while we're at it, every mafia must have a pasta cooked by the Italian mother? The only good thing to do here is less than 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine like the old gypsy. It's pretty good. But the rest, I make you all, "better actors ..."
