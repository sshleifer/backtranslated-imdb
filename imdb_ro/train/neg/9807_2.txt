I rarely give you fewer reviews on a show or a movie I do not like IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just terribly awful, it's terrible. I would not have thought if this was a series of animation - it would have been better than I think, but as a live action show, it typifies the terms "cheesy" and "campy". Of which are Power Rangers. Five colorful, spandex teenagers fight with evil using their martial arts skills. The costumes are horrific - it looks like something that remembers why the athletes and gymnasts will wear on the field and on the field. The actress is cute and the choreography of the fight is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch that it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in her own right. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing; such as a version of the "Nutcracker", or they did ballet rather than fight. Additionally, there are some cartoons featuring martial arts and yet it is fun, but not so frightening, which makes it look silly. Children show or not, it's just so blemished and on the brink of absurdity. And even if this version is put in America, you might be forgiven for thinking that as you watch some battle sequences, they were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; so some "fake" fights and the movie were borrowed from the Japanese version - just to be juxtaposed on the American version. If you like this kind of thing, then stick with Sentai - the Japanese equivalent.
