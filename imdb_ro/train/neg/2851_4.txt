There are often badly fit couples (in the general sense of the term) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven Meets Mister Allison" "The Roots of Heaven" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and Geisha" another good example, so to speak. It seems that the Japanese stuff was trendy at the time, the things being "Sayonara" "the Suzie Wong world" and "the teaser of August". Huston's effort may be the worst of this lot quite bad (except Susie). John Wayne fits perfectly into Ford's world, in Huston it's like a bull in a china shop. His Japanese partner is absolutely bland. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film of absolute boredom. Only those who are totally delighted with every work of Huston must choose this among all of his other films.
