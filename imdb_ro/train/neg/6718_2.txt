I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The story is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it were in the right hands. Targeting and driving were terrible! I had the feeling of watching a movie that was made a lot of amateurs. Although the film has started promising, it has worsened even worse. I think this is a uniginal movie with strange characters. I still think it's worth watching because I have not seen porn movies gay. Do not hold on to your great expectations, then you will be very disappointed. * of *****
