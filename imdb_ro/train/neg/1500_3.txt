Oh, that's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like this is a pornographic party with drugs that led to the resolution of making a movie just for fun. I mean, you can see topless porno actresses having sex, then killed by human mutants. There are a lot of gore, including the classic "Something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she was" and the accidental killing caused by panic. But you can also find funny things like the intestines drawn through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods, then beheaded by a thread bound between two trees (which makes a metallic sound like that, like in cartoons). In a way there is a market for people going beyond porn, you really need to know what's inside an actress, the simple genitals are not enough. So you will see a lot of summary autopsies about the killed bimboos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have very small parts, and I even wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when he accepted a role here. I think this is a movie you have to watch with the paper button before and just watch the juicy stuff just to remind you of the horror movies of the old C class.
