God, I'm so sick of the crap that comes from America, called "Cartoons"! Since the anime has become popular, US animators produce either a cartoon with a 5-year mandarin style drawing (Kappa Mikey) or some rip-off Japanese animations. (Usually mix the classic characters) No wonder the anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They do not even try! <br /> <br /> I heard of last night; I live in the United Kingdom and when I learned that this show first came out in 2005, I never knew that the UK was so up-to-date with the current shows.
