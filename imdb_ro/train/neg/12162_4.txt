This is no horror because the first part was: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. As in many follow-ups, action begins without explanation. But I'm tits, so I do not cry. And they're the real tits. If I understand correctly, they are quite rare today among the teen girls in USA of A. That reminds me that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. This can not be thought of without the first film, so we compare it to it. Again, clothing is too small (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to say in what decade the movie was made. Again there are strange characters, this time even more visible "pathological". Especially camp staff. It's like a mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: most actors must be at least 25, but I think it should be 16 years old or something. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. Actually, this movie does not have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than in any way.
