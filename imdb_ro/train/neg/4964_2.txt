This movie is a hoax! The names are mispronounced wrong and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable of any enthusiastic literature. And it's bad luck to give Beowulf a ridiculous weapon / hedgehog. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In poetry, he breaks Grendel's arm with bare hands! And I can not believe the scriptwriters did that. The way in which Grendel is portrayed is impressive. This and the distribution are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would become mad if they saw this abomination. If you are not a fan of epic poetry "Beowulf", avoid this movie at any cost. And even then, I would not recommend it.
