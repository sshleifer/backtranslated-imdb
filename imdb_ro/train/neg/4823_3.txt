Lament plotting and two-dimensional scripts made characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, this has made it difficult to sense empathy for any of the characters, especially the fiancé; He looks and behaves more like a cartoon. In conclusion, I think you could say he was on an equal footing with your typical television theater. Use almost every cliche in the book. The classic tortured musician who wants to break out and play salsa. Free fiancé, engaged, engaged in a "bean counter" personality she does not love. I will not list them, otherwise it would be a spoiler, because I would give the whole plot. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I've seen it worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was very tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately I did not pay good money to see at a theater. I'm still a little shocked by how many reviews I've forgotten this movie.
