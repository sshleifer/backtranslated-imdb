The original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "The Worst First Success Of A Very Good Movie". In LV2 everyone continues to cry, when a gag does not work first is repeated five more times, with vague hope that it will eventually become funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except, of course, that a parody should be inventive. If you loved LV1, you do not see this movie, you see LV1 again!
