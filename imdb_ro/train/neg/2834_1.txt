We have now tracked all four Bo Derek vehicles driven by her husband, John; all of them are quite terrible, of course, but this is certainly the holes. Having the usual, thin plot, the bad script? by the director, naturally? and acting, not to mention free nudity by the star, deals with the loss of her much older husband, Anthony Quinn (accepts his suicide, saying that he has always admired Hemingway!) but who continues to appear and speak with her. In fact, he wants to go back to another younger body, but he does this only in the last scene! Derek is awesome as always, and still naive (!) ?? especially during an average muddled section that was followed by a committed killer at a spa. Quinn is also usually higher than life here (hammy) here, but this easily constitutes its survival; In addition, for much of the time, it acts behind a shiny plastic piece (probably suggesting it is some kind of limbo)! His "replacement" obviously is obviously a beautiful-looking student who has no talent or personality. Also showcased are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (Quinn's guardian angel in later life)? plus a surprising appearance of the cameo by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed this in his resume)! "It's also self-evident that John Derek was his own movie theater, that the final credits are full of unnecessary expressions (and horns) of gratitude to many people who have borrowed a helping hand and that GHOSTS CAN NOT DO IT swept the Council at the Razzie Awards!
