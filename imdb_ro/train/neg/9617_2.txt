Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) is going to the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop fighting and to fight for something that has no control over her. So take your preparation and something to chew and get back to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a blood bath has already begun when two of the friends are sprinkled before they even go to the party. This movement has the sense of a high school game in which everyone has forgotten his lines and "wielded" ... very stupid! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave his role as Rachel's friend Leo. Besides Fretwell and Gabriel there are some singers who act and some characters you want to blow before they are "disconnected." Paying attention to a few more nerve players to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a day of memory that you would not mind missing.
