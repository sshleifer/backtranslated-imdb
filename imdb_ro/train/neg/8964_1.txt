Those familiar with the two previous Cube films know pretty much what they can expect: a small group of people trapped in a bunch of trapped rooms, paranoia, bad action ... This is a little different though. About half of the film takes place outside the cube where we get to look at people watching the people inside the cube (or at least five of them). I think Cube Zero aspires to explain what is dealing with the cube, but you really do not know much more than what was covered in the first two films. Sure, there is an explanation there, but it feels pretty blades compared to what was suggested in the first film. Cube Zero looks rather inexpensive (just like its predecessors) and the fact that it shows that more than just a few empty rooms highlight this feeling. I have also been quite confident in saying that there is no risk of any of the actors winning prizes in the near future. They brought back the traps from Cube 1, however, (by that I mean they are almost the same, which is a bit of shame). I know many people like this movie and its connections to the first one, but I feel it is a completely useless contribution to a franchise that was not so great to start. [1/10]
