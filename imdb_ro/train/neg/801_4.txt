Despite its stereotypes, virtually "no-name" cast and a low budget, I thought this movie was fine; much better than I expected it to be. At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ridiculous to me. But, finally, I thought the film manipulated the concept well (even if some scenes were a little cliché). <br /> <br /> The film's distribution was pretty good, and the two guys seemed to take the role very seriously. I could not think, though, that Janine Turner is a kind of Geena Davis water. Maybe she's just her face or make-up, her hair and clothes had it in this movie, but she just kept snapping at the back of my mind all the time. <br /> <br /> Although not a must see or a great movie of any type, "Fatal Error" is a fun movie that keeps you up to the end.
