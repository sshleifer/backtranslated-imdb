Awwww .... yes, it's inconceivable and all that unlucky family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has their house "refurbished". Here ends the humanist appeal. I liked earlier in the run, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive. Ten needy families could receive relatively luxurious dwellings with plenty of goods for each family that each episode of this show is filled with. People at Habitat For Humanity have to shake their heads in unbelief. For example, is it necessary for a sixteen-year-old healthy boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom or to have his bed cheated with the "Low Rider" hydraulic system? Does Mom really need an old, rusty and rusty truck that has been restored and "pricked" by some of California's best personalizers? Another would have done this job well and probably a third of the price. Do people really need a plasma screen of sixty-five inches in every room of the house? Then there is the question who pays property taxes and utility bills. Even after zaniacs go to "Makeover", someone still wins their existence. I doubt that Friendly Friends of the Social Services will see humor in this regard. This show is nothing but a grabber for ABC and a tactical ad for its sponsors.
