This entry into Drummond is devoid of continuity. Most of them have the elements of humiliation, the delayed wedding, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events appearing in almost darkness, as the characters are running from one place to another. The house looks like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is so obvious a suspect that no one seems to look at. He's a stranger and he's acting pretty suspicious, but Drummond and people do not seem to take anything. However, it is quite good action and a pretty good ending. I know Algie should be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies, it's so gentle that it's hard to imagine someone with taste or intelligence around him. Is there a history behind him that explains how he and Drummond became associates?
