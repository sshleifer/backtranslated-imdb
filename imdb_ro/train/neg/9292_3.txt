First of all, I also expected another hero - a fantastic work for the kind of action. I've seen only parts of the Hidden Dragon Tiger Crouching, but I can imagine it's better than HoFD. The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: wonderful landscapes, fascinating and honest cinematography. I mean, if you do not understand a word I say without subtitles, but you still care - that's good.) What happened? What begins with the political intrigue is wandering into a love story. Worse, it's a so-called love-like triangle. You have three characters who, I think, fall in love with each other - no good reason. This film breaks down after escaping from prison (I slept for about forty minutes in it). It is as if the writers changed at that moment. The rest of the film refers to how a character is "like the wind." Ick. You also have to stretch your mistrust to believe the pieces of action. This is not unique for this genre, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then, when the fighting is unleashed, it really was not that good. The beginning grabs you, but then the film ends with gas.
