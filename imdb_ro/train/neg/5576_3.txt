So far, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people will not talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses of the Japanese cinema it means all those monsters we have made to love to always destroy those Japanese cities, often in battles with each other. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla, which has returned ten times or more, and in some films the three lovers face as a cosmic monster, Ghidrah. Oddly, the special effects became slightly better. But some of the charm of the old movies was that these sets of paper in the mock-ups were destroyed, they were so fake, perhaps three feet above Ed Wood. Some visitors in the future had time to travel to Japan to exhort Godzilla to be destroyed since the first breakthrough. In fact, he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during the Second World War, when he protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island by those American troops. But later, with atomic testing on bikinis, Godzilla friendly dinosaur, just like Barney became the average car that we came to know in cinematography. Of course, you eliminate Godzilla rather than give Ghidrah a clear field to destroy Japan, so that it does not become the economic colossus that he had until 1991 when the film came out. I will not say more, but we all know that Japan is doing pretty well in 2010. Like all other Japanese monster films, stay calm and enjoy chaos.
