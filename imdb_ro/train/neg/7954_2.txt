Ok this movie was really "unique", let's say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, even if it was said to have had a coke problem during the movie. but he said he did not remember too much. Well, that's excuse, but what are some of them? I can not imagine that everyone had a coke problem. no matter what was so bad, I mean the question was fine and it had some funny moments. though the part of the guy getting that stuff stuffed in his head was a bit too violent for my taste. oh well I think I was disappointed CaRie Fisher is as wonderful as this movie did nothing for her.
