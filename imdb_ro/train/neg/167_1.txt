Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the story should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg is not approaching until Q is bringing Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NOT seen until Kirk meets them, NCC-1701 was the first ship to be named Enterprise ... should I go on? Berman and Pilliar made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ and just went alone. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every episode of star passing to this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this misery. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, like the whole cast. I like everything, but the story is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people have watched Deep Space 9 (which was canceled early).
