I'll spend some days devoted to Ron Howard before he swears my whole work. Luke, unfortunately, taking such a young age, Howard is now caught up with so many Lucas features. How else do you explain his disaster? His only useful film, of course, was Willow. Anything else, including this, relies too much on superficial junk. Some spoilers. He can not even have semi-intelligent attention like Peter Weir. No, Poor Howard stuck so much on his Spielberg qualities that he will be forgotten quickly. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old saying: "love conquers all, even sickness." Too bad for Howard that Lynch went through the whole subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than that. Ron even complains about the possibilities presented by the realities imagined. Howard's way is just terrible. Never rent the DVD. Final Analysis = = Dud Cinematic
