On this day and elderly of incredible film effects, it was a disappointment. The actors seemed rigid and uninspired, as did the dialogue. The West is not an ordinary Hollywood fare so much today, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone there still knows how to make a good one. Given that it's hard to think that someone would go into some kind of spending in liberation, the less it would create a film as weak as that. If you like and look for a good Western, keep searching!
