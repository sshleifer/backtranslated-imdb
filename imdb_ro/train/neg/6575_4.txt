Interesting film about a real event that took place during Vermont's civil war. He kept my attention all the way, and I do not regret seeing it. I have never read about the raid incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels have retired it. I like the historical movies of that era. My major complaint is confederation uniforms. It looks too good !!! The actress was sometimes rigid at times. I like the old man to eat mashed potatoes because he has no teeth. The wounded soldier playing with a dog was a little odd. Generally, it was a film of progeny.
