In the autobiographical story "Romulus, my father", Eric Bana, "Munchen", plays a poor German emigrant struggling to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural 1960s Australia. an obstacle to stability and family happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows without battling the other men. Despite his very unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give him a divorce, torturing himself with a masochist in the hope of vain to return to him one day. Unfortunately, Raimond is good-hearted and good-natured, who has to testify to the whole marital turbulence - and his memory is the one that serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita would later rise as an author). <br /> <br /> Even though I admire "Romulus, my Father" for what they are trying to do, I can not honestly say I liked it, because while the film has some serious performances and intentions, simply are not enough to counteract the haunted story and the funeral rhythm that leaves the audience desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious drama of life is one thing, but this is constantly lost in adultery, madness and multiple suicides (not to mention suicide attempts) is something else.
