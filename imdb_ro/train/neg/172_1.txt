Go back to the cabin next to the Lake does not rise, in any way, to the original. With only one main character (Stanley) who returns for sequal, the movie does not deserve even 2 hours of your time. I am a great fan of the first film, story line and acting was very good, but this is a movie I will never follow again. It's basically equal to what the Urban Legends and Blair Witch sequences were, but it's much worse acting. I've personally seen better in soap opera workshops, it's so pitiful that you just have to laugh. I, in no way, recommend this movie to anyone, forgetting it will distract only from the first.
