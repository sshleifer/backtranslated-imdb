Usually I do not say that a movie is not worth watching, but it is certainly an attenuating circumstance. The only true root of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, showing rather attractive and the fact that this film is very short. The movie is incredibly boring and does not go anywhere anywhere in the movie. None of the characters are really interesting from a distance and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to make this film, but he should have passed it. The only reason I can see that I see this movie is if you're a dead man - I'm sorry Sean Connery and I want to see everything he did. Save the last one. <br /> <br /> Well, if by some miracle I can see this despite my review (or any other review on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
