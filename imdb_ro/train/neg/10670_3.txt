Pleasant characters you do not do and will never interest you. Cringe-inducing dialogue in places. There are no twists (I think they have one, but if you have not figured out after 40 minutes you are not too bright). A lot of well-known actors in roles and performances, which fortunately for all those involved, will be forgotten as soon as the credits at the end are blooming. I do not mind the "slow" movies, but they have to go somewhere. This does not. The plot did not do what the movie made directly to the DVD, it's just a pretty good excuse to try and force some false controversy. Class 37 (!) Ten (10) ratings must be from the people involved in the production.
