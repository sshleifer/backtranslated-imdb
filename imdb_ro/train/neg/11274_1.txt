Just to get movie fans to get the point about this movie, I decided to write another review. We've lost a few things from the last time ... First, the script. Second, the act. Third, Jesus Christ, thinking about making a piece of garbage like this and then waiting for us to enjoy it when there is no redemption from beginning to end, unless Joseph Fiennes arrives in ending in an extremely unexpected climax! br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money about it when I'd given it to a homeless person or a bus or NEVER! <br /> <br /> Get the picture?
