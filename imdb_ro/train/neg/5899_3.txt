All the people who fall in love have made Miike and his work. I stayed tonight tonight. I figured, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I imagined from these comments, it might be, rather than worth my time. I have no luck. <br /> <br /> I thought of the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is one. I do not have beautiful arts master students at NYU, but I know very much: a horror movie has to be rhythmical. We also need to give the spectator more credulity than this movie. This movie rhythm made me shake my head. Some of the scenes near the end were dragged so bad, I went to the refrigerator and stayed there, while Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera for apparent minutes in the end, wide eyes and agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I paraphrase, a movie could be done by turning the room on a beautiful woman and letting her roll. Kou is not an actress good enough to do that. She looks paralyzed at the undead for more scenes than I remember. And she is not the only one who makes an impersonalization of a deer in the headlights; other casting members apparently feel the need to mimic this non-performance. The script gives them little room to do much more for too long. I like the Asian cinema. Hong Kong's stock of action over the past 30 years, Korean horror like "The Phone" and "Koma", Ang Lee's work, some of the filthy but fun films with free sex and fighting, and others. Chakushin Ari could have done without.
