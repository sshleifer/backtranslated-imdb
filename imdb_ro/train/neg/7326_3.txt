This movie has an interesting plot, but the act is pretty bad and the script is weak. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is an interesting one, but because of poor writing and casting, this potential winning premise is prey. 2 of the 4 people in the theater left after about 45 minutes, and the other 2 laughed at how bad the movie was. I'm stuck in the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my mobile phone for the last 30 minutes.
