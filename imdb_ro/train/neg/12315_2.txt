Okay, I'm not an American, but in my Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, never was and will never be a funny man as long as our posters turned south. Phil Silver, as Sergeant Bilko, was a funny one, no doubt because of the wise writers and directors, as well as all the other talented serial teams that contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and most comic situations that America has ever produced them. How can anyone have the courage to even try to replicate Phil Silvers' character is beyond me. For composite stuff, the exercise was repeated in Martin's attempt to be the Peter Inspector Clouseau of the seller, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to re-launch a dismantling career. Some taxpayers say that "Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character," to which I would say "balderdash," his portrait will be forgotten long, when Silvers and Sellars will be valued for future generations
