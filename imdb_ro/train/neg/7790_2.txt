Like some of the others who have seen this movie, and I was nostalgic about it ... before having the misfortune of looking at it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely unsafe, and Pauline's dangers are now revealed as an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist and simple, boring. Even the presence of old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not go beyond a rancid scenario, a terrible theatrical song, and some unfortunate "special effects". In addition, the stereotypical images of the African and Arabic characters lead to a painful view, especially since it was produced immediately after the civil rights movement. Michael Weldon's original psychology says that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television, but inexplicably came to the theatrical release. Judging by the results, this is a completely credible (and confusing) scenario.
