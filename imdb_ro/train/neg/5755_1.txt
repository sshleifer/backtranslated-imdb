I also saw this movie at the High Falls Film Festival screening in New York, and I must say that I realized it was a complete and terrible boredom. Although it was fun in some places, the only real laugh was that it seems to be a real plot to speak, and the action in some places was terrible and wood, especially "Lovely Lady" and the narrator's voice (which I do not have heard of) had much to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, real action and stones and (cast), the only real action. I'm sure that, along with another casting and mastering of the director, it could have been a pretty decent film. Let's hope it's not sent to the general release, or if you really want a copy, look at Lidl's trash.
