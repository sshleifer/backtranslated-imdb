This is probably the best horror movie in Ed Wood. I can not hurt the end, because I have no idea what happened. I'll try everything I can. There are lesbian vampires, but they keep organisms of change, so any character may or may not be the character you ought to think it is or might be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sounds confusing? It's not as confusing as you think, because none of the characters have any sense to start. There is no plot, no character development, and random people will show up, they will speak a few lines, then they will disappear, they will not be heard again. There are also zombies, who are probably the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a dream sequence in a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe none of them actually happened and it's just the hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> Avansul? Both double girls get their shirts short. The special effects are simply mind (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, strange battle sequences). Everyone has a very bad Canadian accent that adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> Well worth the rental price. I laughed until I cried.
