The show had big episodes, it is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's hard to watch "The Man Who Was Death," "All the House," and "Get this cat out, it's really gone." This episode is about a couple who just married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you learned that Charles married Peggy only for her money. The two leave in the honeymoon and the car breaks down a dirty road and has to seek refuge in an old manor of abandonment. Charles soon finds a secret of Peggy's family ... In my opinion, you should watch this episode, but do not expect the same feeling as the rest of the first season episodes.
