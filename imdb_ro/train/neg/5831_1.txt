This movie is boring and pretentively massive. There is only a good time when a sailor laughed at Mr Barney's eyebrows (think of the purple dinosaur). The music is overwhelming - it is sad that Bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, has been brought to pretentious falsity in her art. The tea service pump makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid. mythology and culture are not respected in this film are high. Not just from Japanese culture, but also from another director ... (stay tuned) At a perfect time "imitate life," the crew of the ship finds a huge piece of shit. What the audience found in the theater. There are a few songs that are very composed and heartless - then prepare for spoilers - talk to you MR BARNEY. The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you've been defeated! I saw Jodorowsky's Feast. And your thin, fake BS was lifted. You stole your pictures of your style and your entire art catalog from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY to hope for the powers at the STOP FINANCING YOU world art councils! Poor Jodorowsky - lost in a financial battle with Beatles attorney when Lennon / McCartney is filming. And BTW, while Jodorowsky is Beatle - You're Monkey! A bit of heartless, soul-free soul, only enjoyed by the fresh colleagues at Kitschy. And BTW is a director. If you are interested in making a realistic film - I will fight you legally in a ring that defends Jodorowsky - you, defend the torture.
