Two films are useful to scare people to God, this event and the "Horizon of the Event". One has a meaningful message and poisoning, the other is unique, as a religious film. Too bad Paul Anderson went to the damned film Resident Evil, really had something to do. Thief in the Night is hampered by many independent film attributes (action, stories, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious what the intentions of the film are from the beginning. The Christian film industry has not learned from the failures of this, so we are stuck in the Omega Code, the Watchtower, and the other Tribulation movies. Their fundamental elements are that they are so preoccupied with selling their message: "Save yourself, good people!" that everything else becomes second to kill the audience overhead with a Bible. Generally, I can not believe I write so much about a film that is inefficient. Exit it entirely and return to Sam Neil with your naked eyes. 1 of 5.
