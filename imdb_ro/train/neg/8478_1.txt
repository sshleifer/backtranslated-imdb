This movie was probably the biggest loss in my life ever. The act was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not look troubled. At the beginning of the film, it had to be discouraged. On the contrary, she knocked her head with her bottom lip out. She tears proudly without tears for the scene of crying. I was almost upset that all the girls who wanted to be actresses had to rip it off. All the others suffered from over-action. He was anxious. It was also an insult to represent skaters. Jordan had to train for a month and threw it as a Olympic team. They practically spit on the real effort of figure skaters put into their work. A pitiable excuse for a movie and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Do not lose your life. It does not even deserve a star.
