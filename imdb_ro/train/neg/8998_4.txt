Stephen Feinberg, who starred the proctor and was one of the film's writers, died in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year ago when he told me he was a Hollywood writer earlier, who mostly work on TV promotions. She asked me not to see the Tunnel Vision, but it was too late, I already saw it! In fact, I saw her years before when she was released. At that moment I did not think it was a bad movie. Seeing him as an adult, my opinion was somewhat different. Yeah, it's a little puerily as well as dated. Steve admitted it was not a very good movie. He said he was a little proud of the sketch of the proctologist.
