Sean Bean is great, just like photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is somewhat muddled, and the flat conclusion. This plot has been fundamentally altered in Cornwell's novel, not at the best. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than the one you watched. Sharpe was drawn too narrowly, unlike his literary alter ego, which seems smarter and determined despite his retention in his new role as an officer promoted from rows. I really liked the short scene where Sharpe is hindered by a real "officer", and after a quick break and a breakthrough, he pushes the surprised officer and defeats him back. He sets the tone for his later attempts as a commanding officer. Rating: "4" de "10."
