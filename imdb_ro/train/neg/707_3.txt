"The Feast of All Saints?" Where...? When ...? Was it a feast and theme built on the feast of all saints? <br /> <br /> What a wonderful title lost! There is nothing in the story that has the closest connection to "The Feast of All Saints." There is nothing in the story of the "Day of All Souls" that the term refers to. Why bother to use this title if you never intend to include any story or theme about "All Souls Day" or "Feast of All Saints"? Bad Incorrect Script and Amateur Writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such a great talent to this clunker? The writing is so amateur - characters who have known their entire life go into long speeches about their history of life for the good of the public. Under no circumstances do people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director thinking? Direction is just as bad! Forced and too deliberate style feels amateur. In one scene, a character calls "Get your hands off me" and DO NOT touch it! The worst-set scene, however, is the unbelievable battle scene from the beginning of the movie. Excessive Gore in a very fake, frightening battle scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. Looks like a holiday jump! You can see the extras waiting for their clues to go on the camera. Everyone plays the scene of death as the boys in the 4th grade - exaggerates every little move. The blood of the victims of the battle is so excessive and worry-free, it seems that someone used a ketchup dispenser and just sprinkled straight lines of red on the suits. This whole fight scene comes out as a spoof of a gross war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to go on a horse and deliver punchlines. Who in real life would ever have this way? <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous bit of writing, guiding and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is sitting under the dead body of her hanging father - who is very mutilated, and literally dripping blood from his wounds that open. Even a total idiot would know he's dead! However, it is - very monotonous - always repeating "father, dad ..." while looking at someone on the screen. She delivered it with so much credibility and passion that you could expect from a non-actor child who repeated the camera line all day. Even if the poor kid had any acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl would not be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of massacre - surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while she is quiet there! The natural instincts would make the child scream and scare, running from the bloody massacre! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be scared or laughing ...? A particularly unlucky detail, which gives the scene a SNL satire tone, is the father hanging with a big hook through the mouth and cheek. It looks like a fish on a hook! Unintentional funny details make the whole scene happen to be fake and foolish. In Fantasy La-La-Land, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see a central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the scene and the next scene, which takes place over 20 years later, looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost shot the movie there because the direction and the writing were obviously terrible - but I tried to leave it because I wanted to see Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I do not know what these good actors thought when they accepted these roles! Who was the target audience? The excessive amount of blood and the violence accused of the opening scene are strange to the place with the tone of the story of the soap opera. It is also a strange way to start a film that, for the rest of the time, seems to be oriented towards the Romanian romance of reading. Strange inconsistency in tone!
