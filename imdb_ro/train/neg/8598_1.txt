Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so bad he was hilarious. My friend and I hired him because it looked so bad. Terrible horror movies are always good for some laughs. The cry was embarrassed, some voices were called, the quality was terrible. But we had an explosion watching!
