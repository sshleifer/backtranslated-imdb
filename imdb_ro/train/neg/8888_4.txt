I rated the high base 2 instinct, however this movie received less than a rating of 4. This movie received only 4 from me but has 7.3 from over 600 people. I do not see any reason why I like this movie so much. This movie is boring because it never leaves those rooms in that big broken house. And it has only a total of 5 people in this movie. The duration of almost two hours is absolutely useless. Many dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The film may be shortened to a few sentences. This movie reminds me of "three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, that one is equally boring, dialogues are also equally boring. It also has a high rating! I had to stop watching after the first story. This movie has no passion or emotion.
