California is disturbing. I think there is no reason to tell this story. It's neither fun nor social. From a technical point of view, the movie is very well done, the performances are top and first class. The story develops in an interesting and exciting way. But in the end, this film gets sick and is upsetting with decency. I recommend California to no one.
