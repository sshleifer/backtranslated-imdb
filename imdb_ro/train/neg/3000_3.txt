School School Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a laboratory explosion (set by them) where his face is shaken by acid. A few years later, all the jerks are invited to high school (closed) for a reunion. What they did not know was that Marty invited them to kill them. Then a storm begins, they are stuck in school and Marty begins to get revenge. Very bad. The killings are inventive and bloody and there are some crazy atmospheric photos of the deserted school - but that means. The humiliations of Scuddamore are more than raw (he is naked, his head is stuck in a toilet and burns) and it's just uncomfortable to look. Since Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after he was released, it is almost impossible to see. Also, this film goes out of its way to nudity. There is a front front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie), but a girl decides to make a bath alone ... After I know a killer wanders after them! And then there is the couple who has to have sex. This is the type of movie in which the killer seems to know where everyone is and can teleport with them. It ends with a twist that made me moan and roll my eyes, then another twist that wanted to throw something hard on TV! The action is bearable - not good but bearable. Caroline Munro is also in this case. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. This becomes a 3 for some dirty crimes and atmosphere effectively. Otherwise, run the mill and look. Scuddamore's tragic success gave this film more attention than it deserves.
