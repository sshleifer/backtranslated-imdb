Rookie suffers so much. There are random musical songs interspersed with the film, the long and useless script, and a bunch of enough to make Jerry Lewis reddish. Noonan and Leavitt know when to give up. It takes a whole hour for the story to finally reach the main plot, and the characters are nautical. Then the boys begin to play Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest part of the movie is when Noonan and Leavitt play stupid Japanese guys and stereotypes. But, it gets quite tiring after going back and forth between two sets of characters. Then it ends abruptly. Even a Julie Newmar stripped in a towel can not save him. There is very little charm in the movie and it's too long for over half an hour. The story just flounders along the quest to establish funny situations and failure. Stick to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm, and Jerry had that animated face.
