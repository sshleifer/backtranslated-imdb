Considering how much money was budgeted for this movie, you would expect more of the whole story. This could most likely be the most worthless movie I have ever seen. There has been no real advancement of nothing. Character development, minimal. Evolution of the plot, maybe. Joy, none. I'm not sure which points they even tried to make. If you want to see a movie in which the terrorists are good boys, the American CIA bombs everything that disagrees with our beliefs, all the capitalists are corrupt and you like to see something like a story advance accompanied by a death. For those of us who realize they do not kill a good guy to make a point, we'll stay on other movies. In conclusion, this was a horrible attempt at a "Ocean's 11" movie, the hideout-so-person-has-for-thinking, because you not only do not know what's going on, no one who made the movie. Home Singer 3 was a better cinematic play.
