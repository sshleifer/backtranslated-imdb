Except for the best acting environments of the two stars, this movie is really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you have not really noticed that production values ​​are cheap unless they have tried to convince you that they have begun to give production values. Even for a B-movie genius like me, this movie is really grim.
