What kind of documentary about a musician fails to include a single piece by the artist himself ?! Unlike "Ray" or countless other movies about music artists, half of the fun in the theater (or on the couch) resumes the great songs. Here, all tracks are covered with uninteresting characters, and these interpretations fail to capture the slow, jazzy style of Cohen. Most often, covers are popular versions of popular music. Yuck. Interviews are more or more with other musicians and figures, rather than with Cohen himself. Very rarely, the film makes Cohen read his own work (never sing) - such as letters, poems, etc. The film did not surprise too much about the story of the artist's life or about its evolution over the years. A great disappointment for a great fan of Cohen.
