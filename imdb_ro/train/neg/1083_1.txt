This film is like the real life I mean - not much happens in the 2 hours available and not too much the game plan or plot is highlighted by the often invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the "experimental" illumination as mentioned by many commentators). <br /> <br /> A great boredom. It's not a big surprise that Altman leads her - it's a very variable interpreter (yes, we all loved "Gosford Park," but "Price A Porter" anyone - Kansas City, Dr. T. and Aaargh Women). the raw material is a story of John Grisham, and the excellent distribution that you will see through the brilliant gathering of your insistent sleep - makes it truly a masterpiece of the evil film. And no, it's not "so bad that it's good." It's just bad.
