102 DALMATIANI [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous tranche, and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a bad, lined, frightening story to act by Glenn Close, who madges every scene as if they were playing their own amusement, and incredibly confusing and uninteresting actors. Once again, dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and that's a stretch. Another effort lost here. Grade: D
