- Let me start by saying that I understand that the invasion of star creatures was meant to be a parody of SF films in the 1950s. I understand that none of them should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of them works. A parody should be funny and that's not. Not over the course of the whole runtime I did as much as a smile. Generally, it's easy to make fun, but we could not find any kind of entertainment anywhere in the Star Creature Invasion. I knew I had problems from the beginning. The two "stars" appear on the screen with one of the easiest imaginary gangs - a water hose that they can not control and that makes them both wet. The two separate as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why someone would want to mimic the act and persona Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the less illustrious start, the movies continue to contain comic tracking sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other matching bits. Everything is a waste of time. - I bought this on double DVD with the invasion of bee girls. This movie is an Academy Award winner in comparison to the Star Creature Invasion.
