Oh brother. The only reason why this very irritating film avoids getting the total "bomb" from me is because it is at least historically worthwhile to note that the first movie Three Stooges (when they were not yet on their own and were still swallowed by that sweet little girl Ted Healy). But even as an old Stooges fan, I should say that the young Moe, Larry and Curly are very badly used here, as three assistants, in the care of Mr. Healy's superior. They are not constantly presented through the movie and their on-and-off-on-off busts again paint them more like zany cartoon characters with hard to try too hard to be funny. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl, who in vain attempts to make some chuckles from the public himself as a man who is impersonating Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of humor: "Object!" what reasons? "" Cafes! "). His friend is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even schnoz is boring.
