There is a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a table in the boardroom, wondering what new show to do. <br /> <br /> "What about something like 24 or The Wing Wing?" one says, but everyone agrees it's too expensive, and cheap TV is less likely to damage the station if it's flopped. <br /> <br /> "Well, how about joining some comedians and making a quality sitcom?" offers another and is fired on the spot. "You do not know that good writers cost a lot of money!" the great bark chief. "That's why I invented the reality of TV." "We could do another crime ...", suggests a man in a soft suit. "Listen," the boss replies, suddenly interested. "People like CIS, so make another copy of this," adds Blandman. "But there are already too many CIS clones out there, what can we do to distinguish us?" A na√Øve mayor asks and is immediately dismissed. "To point out, if we do that, people can be mistaken! "We add more violence and make it really terrible, we are finally Fox," another process suggests a consistent response to "you now have received it, "from the great boss." We could do them the unit of deviant delinquencies, "he continued, adding clearly on a road." De Jove, he took it! "the big boss laughs," and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on the screen. "Well, that would distract people from average and weak scenarios," says Blandman. <br /> "Then it's settled, we just need a name," the big boss announces. "Could we call him the police officer's violence?" /> <br /> "Too literal, how about the" Killer Instinct, "which transmits violence, but sounds a bit like the basic instinct that had a lot of sex. <br /> <br /> "Puuurfect," the big boss responds, and then everyone laughs at each other on the back and leaves and cancels Arrested Development.
