If someone does not brighten me, I really have no idea what this film is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from it. This film tells the useless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And, that's all. When that agent is played by Pacino, we have to think it must be important. But there is no need for hard thinking to find out how dreary and boring this movie is. One of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone"), which deserves the title "the most boring and the most useless film of the year". So, what's going on, Al?
