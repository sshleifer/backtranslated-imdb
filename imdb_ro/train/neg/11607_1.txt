I found Horrorvision almost undiscovered. While I was only 70 minutes in length, I woke up again and again by pressing the fast forward button. The actor was "screaming and saying a very intense school." And the story was the best scenario that was not supposed to be worked out. While I never go to Full Moon to make a great movie, I've never seen him produce a piece of junk like that.
