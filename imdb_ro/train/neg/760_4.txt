A "new" insubstantial and undefined Columbo, who sees that the man in the pop is attending his nephew's wedding just so that his bride disappears on the wedding night. Columbo is investigating ... And that's about it: undoubtedly traced and surprisingly loaded with a flat screen scenario, as it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote Columbo's very pleasant story "Murder Under Glass" in detective peak time; is not even a crime to talk about and the greatest ingenuity given to Columbo by the screenwriter is the narrowing of the suspects through the photos taken at the wedding, including all those who were there! /> Not all possible Columbo features, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with a style of soap opera. Very avoidable things.
