I would have considered this movie a minus 10, but unfortunately not offered. Why I did not go in the first five minutes of this movie I can not say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately! Several people in our theater did, and unfortunately we did not follow them. The story did not contain all the criteria for a movie. NO plot. Great acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointed that I can never see another movie in which to be. No single relationship in the story went beyond the conversation in the salon. I liked the scene shy. It was a shame he did not shock a lot of meat in the senseless plot. Someone has to rock the writer and director of this movie!
