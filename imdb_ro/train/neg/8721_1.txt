I'm sorry, but that's just pathetic. The little girl was a boy, they were not pleasant characters and the plot was sucked. Besides, he was not even a gator, as the movie would want to believe. If you check out any complete guide for reptiles, you will find that it is indeed a crocodile, not a gator. Obviously, they did not hire a real animal expert or know that the creature is a croc. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this.
