What can you say about a blossoming, 16mm-thick, deaf-eared film where the best and most attractive performer is a German Shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this transference at any cost. In any case, it would be difficult to find, because bestiality remains a taboo and an illegal topic in the US. I strongly recommend IMDb to re-visit the weighting formula for rating ratings because an 8.8 rating for this piece of faeces is absurd! I am by no means a prude and spent many hours enjoying classical porn movies from the 70s and 80s; but this is a inferior product, even by the weakest standards of the loop (then illegal) deer.
