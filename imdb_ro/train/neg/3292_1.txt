For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I will begin with the wicked. Negative points: Casting choices (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), the acting said badly casting casting, the story, the idea of ​​setting the film nowadays, direction, editing, soundtrack and, above all, the idea to make a feature film from a television series that was not so great to start with, despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! It could be done in a scene where Jessica Simpson, like Daisy Duke, is heading to Michael Weston as Enos and asks the question: "Enos, where is Boss Hogg and Roscoe?", in court his cloudy, tells him where I am. as well as asking "Enos, is it a good movie?", the red bikini would have darkened his judgment by saying he did, even if in his right mind he'd say, "No, not really." While looking at bikinis, they could have been completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of shooting. Run away from Hazzard!
