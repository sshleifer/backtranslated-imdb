First of all, the reason I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least Peter Falk has given his usual fantastic performance of Lieutenant Columbo. Only he can get 10 stars to try to save this unsuccessful attempt to make a movie. We were initially all fired to read the commentary of a poster that Andrew Stevens made in this film "his career." For me, Stevens' abisal show has completely destroyed this movie, so we were prepared to throw all sorts of insults to the person who made this comment. Then I thought about myself, what else did Stevens do? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, it seems that each of the 33 projects that Stevens has been since was stupid, so it is doubtful that someone has even seen the rest of his career. If you like Columbo, you see each of the 69 titles before seeing it. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for the last.
