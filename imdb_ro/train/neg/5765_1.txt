Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to start. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it near this cargo, it's a classic comedy. While the second part was humorous and cheap, at least funny. There is nothing fun about forced humor. Banknotes, banners, and business cards should be naturally funny. Hitting the spectator over his head with tired jokes is not cold. Humor in this movie was for juvenile idiots who would laugh at anything. When they served the high school crowd, any sense of self-esteem was thrown out of the window. The parodies of the ring are not funny. I've been watching them in comedies since 1998. They're so good. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. What is even worse to make fun of two breakdowns was "performers", whose good days were NEVER. The death of American cinema was slow. Movies like this are nails that are beaten in his coffin. What happened to real humor? I have not laughed aloud in a long-time theater movie. Too many bad movies rot the brain. Do you want proof? Go to your local movie rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe the hype. I would prefer to look at Scary 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer again through this poor apology of a comedy! Surely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
