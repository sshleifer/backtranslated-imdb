I saw this movie under the title of "Tied Up". Overall, I enjoyed Dolph's movies, so I tried it. It's not worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the box that attracts viewers. Do not be fooled. This is a poor film at best. The act is not non-existent. The plot, which is a bit of one, is very predictable. The movie in places seems to be cut together. This simply smells the place up. It's not even worth the price of a cheap nightly rental. As a little fan of Dolph, I waited for him to see him in action. By the end of the movie, you'll be waiting. Best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost anything else.
