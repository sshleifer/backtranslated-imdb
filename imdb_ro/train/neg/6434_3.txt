I am always surprised at how different people are and how almost every film you get both extremes. People who think it's the best movie and those who think it's the worst. Stigmata would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all the sound. Manufacturers spent more time on the soundtrack than editing. It was so strong when the soundtrack was playing and no one spoke, and when Patrica spoke in her monotone voice, it could hardly be heard. I usually liked Patrica and Gaberial, but both were flat in this movie. Patricia had basically three emotions. Quiet, in great pain or very angry, has stigma. The first one was the predominant one, the second involves the screaming pain, the third involves the increase of the voice. It was a loud voice that destroyed the three, not the emotions. Perhaps I lacked much profound meaning and emphasis everyone talked about, or maybe I was distracted by the awesome filming and MTV style. When you watch a 3-minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story in a 2-hour long movie, it's wrong. I can not see her sense of seeing the women on the steet and the fall of a child. And no Pittsburg rains so often! I think maybe a real story, with something to say, could have been intentional, but all the budget was spent on buying music and equipment for slow rain by throwing cadres and renting that gorgos apartment that Mrs Arquett lived for they're burning the guy with the story.
