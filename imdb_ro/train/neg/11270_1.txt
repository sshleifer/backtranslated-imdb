I've seen bad movies, but that's gotta p ***. It makes no sense and all the characters do is to swear every few seconds, oh and I think one has a low sperm count. It's so good. A Welshman plays a robber. A poor English boy plays a madman stray by a fool a madman, and some smaller lights play tarts dim. And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes, some have a gun and can talk with garbage while they have big drugs. Avoid this movie like plague.
