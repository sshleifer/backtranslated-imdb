There were so many films based on the same theme. the only nice girl needs a nice boy to impress ex, pays it and then (guess what?) falls in love with him, there is a little buzz followed by a string before everyone to do before the happy ending ... ... has been done many times. The thing is, I knew that before I started looking. But, despite this, I was still looking forward to this. In the right hands, with good distribution and a brilliant scenario, it can still be a pleasant way to go a few hours. <br /> <br /> This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. A female leader who did not have the charm or spirit that failed to illuminate even the slightest spark in me. I really did not care if she "took her man" or she was alone and unhappy. A male leader who, after some of his endless words of wisdom, wanted to kill him. Just to get rid of this look. I did not have the idea that to lead a male whore life was the way to all-seeing all-knowing illumination. A completely unrealistic movie full of unrealistic characters. no one seemed to have jobs, all of them had more money than a sense, a groom who went on with the wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend ... plus "I would Missing even if I had never met "!!!!! I could go further but I just realized I was losing more time on this clay ..... I could think of introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name "woody", but in reality it was only the humorous thing that happened in the movie.
