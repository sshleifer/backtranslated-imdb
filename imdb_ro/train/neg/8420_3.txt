Despite the excellent distribution, this is an unimaginable film, especially from aviation perspective. Perhaps it's a bit better than von Richthofen and Brown, but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best in a small market over the past 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if it's not taken seriously. It's interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new high-quality WW I aero movie.
