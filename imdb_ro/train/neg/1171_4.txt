I can not believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a director whose other works I enjoyed very much. The experience of resisting LADY AND THE DUKE (and will not make any word other than "durable") left me in an annoying mood, an easy condition only by reading the IMDb comment by ali-112. That not only did Rohmer (successfully) try to make us see the world through the art of the 18th century genre in France, but, as he pointed out, he showed (with the price of alienating his audience) the effects of class consciousness and the revolution she inspired through the eyes of an elitist woman in her times. The director has done something undeniably difficult, but he asks me if he deserves the necessary effort for him - or for us to follow the boring results of his work.
