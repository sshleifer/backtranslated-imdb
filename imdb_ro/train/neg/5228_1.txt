I saw this movie last night. I can not even begin to say how much this film suffocated. Writing, voice acting, even plague. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching 24 hours from C-Span for the sake of comedy. It just does not work. It is literally lowered to almost any possible place. Also, movie animation is very poor. I know this is a one-person movie, but he thinks he could make 97-minute crunching, maybe he could do at least a second of fun. cake to be the worst movie of all time. Oops. It was so bad. If you're looking for a movie that makes you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: Do not buy it, or look for it. Your brain will be more than you.
