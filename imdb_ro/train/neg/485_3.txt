When I saw the preview, I thought: This will be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress who played the main character was very credible, and the beauty of filming is incontrovertible. However, dialogues have cast a dark shadow over the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action that took place in 1610 and took most of the film's magic. However, I must congratulate the translators, because the English subtitles were more refined and more appropriate than the original French clues and probably explains the good rating the film received on imbd!
