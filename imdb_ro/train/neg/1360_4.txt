A reasonable effort is summed up for this film. A good film of sixty, but lacking any sense of accomplishment. Maggie Smith gave a decent interpretation that was quite credible, but not as good as she could have done, other actors were just terrifying! A terrible portrait. It was not very funny and so he did not manage to touch his genres because it was not very funny and not dramatic. The only kind achieved at a satisfactory level was love. The target audience was not hit and the movie sent messy messages. A very basic plot and a very basic story have not been drawn or performed at all, and people have been confused about why the movie was not as good and who was the target audience, etc. However, Maggie was pretty good and the story was fine in moments of capacity. <br /> <br /> 4.
