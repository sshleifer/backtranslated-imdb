Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a major hand problem. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom psychic Tess extraordinaire (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, was resurrected with the first power (Satan given after his execution in the gas chamber) and can possess the bodies of the weak. In a way, Russell, joining forces with Tess (who has an understanding of what they are against), will have to stop Channing or more women will continue to die in the bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen), who tried to inform her superiors in the first-ever Catholic Church, but was denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing ... cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart Channing, eliminating the world of his evil. She will take it anyway and give her a helping hand to Russell, who will need all the help she can get when Channing Tess kidnaps her training for some sort of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always an actor supporting the actor, becomes the partner of Russell's role, so you know what will happen to him. As in movies of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he simply kills the weak host of another poor soul he possesses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Phillips and Griffith are trying, I will give them this, but in such a shot they have no chance. Kober, which is normally often always as effective as Heavy, is really taught nothing more than a tont negative character that jumps into the air and throws rotten whales.
