To be honest, I did not like the "Executive Decision" - which was the model obvious - very much, but compared to this piece of nonsense, it looks like a masterpiece of art. people who are moving into the film (the term actors would be an insult to all other actors) should participate in several classes of acting, the guy who built the setting did not even see a far-fetched aircraft. It's so ridiculous that on a flight only 747 are on board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is illogical (for example, use the sleeping gas, then do not use it, then use it anyway), which finally dropped my rating to the bottom. You can have more fun by rearranging your sock drawer or drilling a hole in your knee and filling it with milk.
