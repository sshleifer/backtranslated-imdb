this movie is really trying hard. if you go to make a horror movie, at least give him a reason to believe in looking at the spectator. <br /> <br /> Wait and wait for the movie waiting for a big explanation, but no. Instead, try to end too much and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the movie? where does it actually go? and more importantly what the hell is happening. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how do they bind to something? just another horror of SF sci-fi. I like the false comments on IMDb saying how big it is through press releases related to bump the film (whether or not people have small horizons). it's not worth 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than the fragile, but at least it gave you reason and why things happened and has a final result. this is not the case and only the suitcase is made with tons of stuffing to make everything feel scary. this movie is as low as when a stranger sounds. God who was also lame. <br /> <br /> Great tip, if you will make a horror, make credible with the reasoning and explain to the spectator what is happening, so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reason or credibility, then there is no firm firm on anything and it can not be scary. no disrespect for distribution or crew because they did a good job. it's just poor writing.
