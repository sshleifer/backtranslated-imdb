Well, it is not often that in the UK we have a film about inner life from the perspective of the African-Caribbean community, the last example I remember was Babylon's underestimated road from 1980. So I had great expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that was portrayed as the British version of La Haine! Well, La Clothes is not! I agree that using dialogue and the environment gives this film authenticity that has been missed in other late British films, but my concern is that this film is definitely unfortunate. The film cleverly deals with the blacksmanship on black violence, which is unfortunately all in common in London, but I am concerned that filmmakers are now using casting in plotting, unlike characters who are just as much harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a movie that could be both fun and inspirational to all of us, but unfortunately missed and created a movie that only reinforces the idea that to be a black male couple in London , the only future is violence and tragedy
