I gave these 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and left unexplained and due to the erroneous scenes of a person who is eating in a very disgusting way, plus the scenes of a fallen body. <br /> <br /> None of the above must be displayed in such a graphic manner. The plot of the film, as it happens, refers to three stories that interconnect, none of which end satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The bounty hunter played by Bruce Dern is the character that links all three vignets. First of all, we have Dylan McDermott, escaping to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter when he walks through a border town and signs a blond-haired girl-girl playing by Helen Hunt. Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, I do not know which of them, playing a Western wife on the lonely border that goes to see a neighboring woman, an attractive redhead, which we soon realize we got out of the badlands too long. /> The film's conclusion returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, the final screenplay of the film being completely beyond rational understanding.
