The real irony is the following: Joe Besser was a top comedian in other situations far from Stooges. He had a precise experience to be very funny and intelligent. Moe and Larry and Shemp had actually known him for at least many years and liked his work. So what happened on Earth when he joined the band as "the third stooge"? Obviously, nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" pants, more often than boys, boys are opposed to the other or to Joe against the other two, and this is not the exact Stooge tag. "One for everyone, one for one, each for himself", to quote Curly from the "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Marx Brothers, no matter how much they try to take advantage of each other or to reconcile each other, when the chips are actually down, come to the aid reciprocal. In this case, nothing happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight as someone tries to cheat others or be bad and not too comic. It may be assumed that behind the scenes something is happening, art imitates life. Maybe there was actually why Besser did not have too much time with Moe and Larry. Look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
