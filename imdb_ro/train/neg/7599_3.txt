A friend told me about John Fante last summer after I got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was Bukowski's favorite writer-a writer with similar edge and humor, except for a previous generation. "Ask the Dust" was the first Fante book I've read and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a splendid piece of writing about a sad and frightening young writer who portrayed himself and the outside world as a talented, talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences they did not -he had. In the novel, the protagonist is virgin, having no idea how to win the graces of women he desperately writes in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how to sit for his first sexual encounter with an admirer "hurt" and how he finally has nothing but the story of his failed love attempts, is muscular and real, without touching Hollywood final. Adaptation of the film remains a true book for a while but returns to the cinematic trap of persevering love through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a villain and that Camilla is crazy and that their love has never been and never would be the real thing, no matter how much one of them wanted to find her one in the other. This film has destroyed the true meaning of the story and replaced it with the schlock. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that made so bad.
