An executive, very successful in his professional life, but very helpless in his familiar life, encounters a boy with a syndrome down, escaping from a residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and the seemingly less smart will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument, an atmosphere similar to Amelie and sentimental music, I only expected a disgusting moralistic film. However, because there were interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes a violent guy) and the performance of the two actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqual Duquenne, was great, I decided to continue watching the movie. French cinema generally has the ability to show something that seems quite alive, unlike the more stereotypical American cinema. But for this reason, it is more disappointing to see after the absurd end, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive family, the cheap morale, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy fluttering from the sky like Michael Landon ... Very ugly, in my humble opinion.
