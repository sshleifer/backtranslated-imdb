This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. Interspersed with shows from "the next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for the videos of Leonard Cohen, who returns to everyone else in the film, with his presence, wisdom and skill, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as an Old Testament prophet. Many of the interpretations are useful interpretations (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright) or weak sub-achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony have reached a striking distance from Leonard's own versions, using a small retention. Small annoying pseudo-avant-garde gestures are splashed across films - such as the superior focusing of red spheres during several concerts and interviews, the blurred work of the room, the use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments to hear what what is being said) and a frightening, pretentious blow under a lot of interviewing segments (an attempt to add gravity?). For the Real Things, see The Lives of the Documentary Life Produced by the BBC in 1988.
