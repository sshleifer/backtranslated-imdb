Another Priyadarshan / Vohra movie that was seen for TP rather than real desire, the only reason I saw this movie was the fact that ordinary people were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but useless say they had little expectation from this movie. I was pleased with casting in general, except Rajpal Yadav, who once again bothers without limit, but he does some laughs, but these were those non-original joke standards, in fact this whole movie is like playing dhol , I mean he does not need almost any talent to make loud noise, or even play the strange good beats on dhol for a little time does it? Its only people who can carry different beatings in a beautiful sequential fashion for a long time, which are considered wonderful. What brings us to the other tool, Dumroo does not need any talent, has no variants and can be enjoyed for a while by monkey dances (sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but it's not a tool that will make you much fun or even you will dance like Dhol. /> This movie was like dhol and dumroo being played, sometimes Dhol was sometimes played by Dumroo, sometimes together, but especially Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any age 24 years earlier than later I was bored. The film has some good moments Dhol (good), but after a while all I heard was annoying Dumroo (initial fun, then tolerable, then irritating), the big regular pieces really ensure that this movie is mainly good for some funny videos about "BEAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you did not watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evening and it's really quite funny) This movie had its moments, the actors did a good job, except for Rajpal Yadav (who can act, although I saw it in Main Meri Patni?), Which disturbs more than just fun, I said a long time and I will say it again. I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a good career in front of them, especially in comedy with more stars. Some scenes were very funny, such as the aborted attempts to impress girls' dad, the attempts of anger to fool the girl and take her away from each other. But once it's over, an attempt to make this movie much more with a mystery added, it means that once the girl has been in, the next 45-60 minutes has been increasingly tortured, the climax of it was "so good they almost CATEGORY good", I want to say what they were thinking if you had to end, try at least try to do this tasty. The movie is also highly predictable, it's hard a scene that you can not predict and you will not be broken into spontaneous laughing out here, more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before gag. The film follows a gradual decline throughout the movies, except strange bumps, down or up, and then quickly tumble downhill once made friends with the girl. Most of the really bad scenes were at the end, a movie is trying to be more than a running comedy mill, also many of the jokes were very old and rehearsing, THE BEST 10-15 AMONG SPECIAL DEVICES AND COMPLETE MOVIE. I did not find Tanushree Datta pretty siren she should have played, and her acting talent is a serious question, especially in terms of her non-appealing appearance, if you can not be a HOT and Cant to act as long as you can survive. Technically, this film was also weak, with a steady look of female and nightmare lighting and working with the room. <br /> <br /> Songs except the song title was not good, when the songs played in the second half, I could feel the collective ear from the audience. In a movie that is just accustomed only because of distribution and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> Avoidance will not be a bad idea. And if you have to be watched watching on free TV or a very cheap matin√©e or something is a necessity, if you pay multiple multiple rates, you will feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> - Many remaining jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, the last 45 minutes and the last 15 minutes in particular, bad melodies from a technical point of view, bad. <br /> <br /> +/- try to be more than what it was, not the usual cast (I'm happier for that), Tanushree Datta. There are some good scenes in the beginning, title song, good action and cast, except RY. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am trying to be an objective here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie has met my very low expectations, so I give it all the doubts in absolute terms the film was no more than a 4)
