I passed it on the shelf several times, looking at the huge mirage of miracles (small names) in front and wondering if I was missing something. Last night was on one of the movie channels and I went in. I missed nothing. I have to admit that I only looked at the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film then becomes golden comedy. Given the slow pace, plodding and total lack of laughter in the first 30 years, I seriously doubt. The main character begins the classic movie "I Do not Know How To Start My Movie", with a long and tiring monologue about how he does not want to sue. It's not funny. It's not really funny. Others commented a little about "San Franclisco"; ok, a little giggle the first time she says it. Then he buries him in the ground, smiling at the camera, as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Get over you. In fact, I think talking to the camera was the reason I immediately disliked the movie. Do not take your acquaintance with the public. Familiarity is also respected as well as respect. From here, in fact, you have a type of fat to speak in a very effeminate way about his boring life as temperature. I did not realize he was a Jew; is a discredited Jewish comedy to call this "Jewish humor." It's just unpleasant humor. Just because you're a Jew does not mean you have a comedy talent. A WASP, Spalding Gray, has a better self-analyzing humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. If one of the bits we saw would have worked, I would have stayed around. But some schlub happens about how much she loves the names of the women they work with, then lists them for five long minutes, does not make a wonderful movie. This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "office space". Do not let yourself become a victim of target marketing. Just say no to the "Haiku Tunnel".
