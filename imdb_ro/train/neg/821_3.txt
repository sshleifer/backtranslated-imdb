Stanley Kramer leads a thriller of action and points to two key things: action and emotions. DOMINO PRINCIPLE presents Gene Hackman as a convict who went out of prison to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his operators - probably working for the government, but that, like most of the film, is never clarified. Hackman asks a lot of questions he NEVER answers, so the movie does not go anywhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO PRINCIPLE combines ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The movie is extremely well photographed, but even it works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! The actor is fine, Hackman proving he is quite incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are badly bad, and Albert is very well presented as Widmark's cruelty. Even the ordinary Mickey Rooney is quite good as Hackman's opponent. It's a strange thing to share Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told he's finished his time in prison and he seems to be trying to get some kind of beating from the south. Kramer's idea of ​​making it look like a trash is to wear a bad brown wig. It's a better role for those like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
