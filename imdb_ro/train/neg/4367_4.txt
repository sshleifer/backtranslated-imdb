A real clinker of Boris Karloff. In essence, the dying Karloff (about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to finish his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco, where his funding is taken over by someone else, he goes to southern France, where a doctor works while trying to destroy enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the rich young wife of a dying cotton baron. She'll finance him if she helps him poison her husband so he can take his money and go on with a gigolo (who thinks he's married). If you think that I have obtained this from watching the movie you are wrong with, I had to read what other people have posted to discover that it happened. Why? because this movie lost me two minutes in. I had no idea what's going on with his many characters and multiple compiler plotting lines. Little is written and many are not told until the end until I really cared about it. It's a boring misery of interest for Karloff's performance, which is quite odd at times. To be honest, this is the only time I've ever seen him venture into the bizarre Bela Lugosi territory. Not in every scene, but in a few, and it makes me wonder how long it stood outside.
