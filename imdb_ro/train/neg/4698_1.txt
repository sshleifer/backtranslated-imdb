Do I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? So if the ten of them are too immature for a child to sing "about being my women", I mean seriously! And the name's pretty weird, brothers naked? just because he pulls out his pants ??? How CREATIVE.I do not get why they need a TV show I mean that most artists do not really need a TV show about themselves, especially the band of naked brothers. How many are in the frenzy group. And seriously what about the movie? Jeez Nick uses to be the maximum light of my growing years, but seriously the band naked brother? So many parents would not let the kids follow this, especially with the name of Naked Brother, a bad and non-Christian show that should not be broadcast on the TV.
