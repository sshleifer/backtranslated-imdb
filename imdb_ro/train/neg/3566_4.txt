Now, I have not read the original story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I will not go this way here. But I learned a while ago that Stephen King movies are just not horror films, maybe with a few exceptions. This was not one of them. It started quite well and for once I will not complain about acting, although Fred Gwynne was usually wonderful. I also forgive the total lack of parenting skills as they were required to make the story here to move forward ... But there was a consistent point I could only help but get angry with. And that's pretty close to the end of the movie and at least two characters get involved in silly stupidity. The moments I'm referring to are like this: There is a small zombie running around the house. You suspect he's under the bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More, <br /> <br /> (b) Remove a little from the bed so that you can look under the fully open end of a lightweight safety position or at least see the mini-terror coming from you, giving you a little time to react. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel as if I had offered today for slaughter. Bleh <br /> <br /> Fun pretty movie though ... Just not very scary.
