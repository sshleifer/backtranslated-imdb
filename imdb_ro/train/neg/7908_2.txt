I did not expect too much when I saw this at Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other movies were sold. However, I had hope. It sounds a bit like "The Bride and Prejudice" (type L.A. falls for Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with some good laughs and nice characters. "" My Bollywood Bride "had nothing of it." The act looked odd, and it came to figures, the characters were so clumsy that the story seemed to have been written by the fresh-school student. technically, the sound disturbed me a lot, it sounded as if there were a lot of overburdening the dialogue, that's a lot, I know it's sometimes necessary, but it sounds like half the movie was shot in a closet and it became very distracting. Two stars are somewhat generous.
