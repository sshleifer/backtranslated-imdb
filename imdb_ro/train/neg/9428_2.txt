Normally, I do not have time to make comments that few will read, about the movies that few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn everyone who might consider the loss of time. I just finished looking at her five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The action is horrible, a plot is non-existent, and production values ​​are the best level of poverty. I know even a low-budget movie can be great, but not one. There is only one thing that could have saved this movie for the purposes of any fan of horror - gore more on screen and cut! The total total of three times this happens is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably worrying when it happens - especially at the final stage - it simply is not enough. The film is too long because it is minimal, too hard for dialogue and therefore almost impossible to watch. What happens? In order to put everything in a room shell of a room, three teenage girls go irresponsibly and knowingly to an isolated area where more than 20 girls have been kidnapped and killed. Their car, of course, is decomposed and taken to an old, dull house, inhabited by three madmen - one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are finally killed, one by one, on the screen, after what seems to be an eternity of dull and fuzzy nonsense. As I said, the only things worth to be forgotten at once are crimes. Do not buy it or rent it just for that and do not be fooled as if I were in the art and description of the misleading movie. Save your money and time.
