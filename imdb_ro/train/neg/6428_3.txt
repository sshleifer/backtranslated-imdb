This is the third Errol Morris movie I've seen and I still do not like his style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, serious characters to create documentaries, and then editing the language in the cheek is having fun with all that is involved. It's never a direct caricature of them, and Morris seems to say most of the time: "But no, no, these people are truly fascinated, indeed!" But there are always these subtle angles and little edited techniques that shows that Morris seems to scoff at them. This film treats four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man studying hairless African molars to find that they are amazingly an ant, a lion, a man holding a garden full of animal-shaped bushes and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to turn around the question of what the animal, human and life traits mean? So the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control does not seem to mean anything about the movie ... is it? Unless Morris seems a bit disturbed by the passions of these individuals (he might call them "obsessions"), making synthetic drawings for life. I do not share that fear and honestly I do not appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the movie. But I emphasize his subtlety. Without a voice-narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if Morris ever missed that anxiety on the collective head of the spectators. On the contrary, he mixes the circus images and the images of the mantle often when they are taken out of the circus and ants, showing a kind of collective absurdity behind what all these people are saying. I find them absurd, I find all the people very interested and interested. If, of course, he did not intend to make such juxtapositions, which means he is just a bad craftsman instead of a subversive silence. Since none of the movies I've seen so far have really impressed me, I really do not really care what they're trying to do. - PolarisDiB
