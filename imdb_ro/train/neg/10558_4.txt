I do not know why they have these fans and I do not know why I just gave them the score I have. This is absurd. There is a lot of giallo in which one has to suspend the unbelief, let the image roll and catch it before it becomes a delusion, and some poor policemen must finally explain what we have seen. But this does not take place and has excessive sequences in which nothing happens and has nothing to do with, while we have to listen to a repetitive soundtrack even after the Italian standards. It is not a giallo, it is a complete mystery of horror that presents Klaus Kinski in one of the clearest interpretations "made in". I think he came back, did a working day and moved away from Mr. D'Amato to get others to fill up. Ewa is of course enough, but it is not enough and eventually I have seen too much of it all over long after we have completely lost interest in this crazy and demanding. Maybe I was not in good shape!
