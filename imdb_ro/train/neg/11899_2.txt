Robert Forster, normally a very powerful character actor, is lost at sea here as a New York family who seeks revenge on the bullies who killed his son and attacked his wife in an invasion at home. The infamous subject exploited for cheap emotions in "Death Wish" vessels. It is not difficult to be upset with these appealing processes: the dialogue is full of tormentors, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and support characters are ridiculously over-written (especially a clever judge allowing an accused criminal to go straight from the room judgment). Low rent production is despised in its own righteousness, especially since violence in our cities has only increased. * from ****
