... yet I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least visible for two-thirds of the time, but the third boring and selfish section of that film gave us a taste of what would come in this extraordinary self-indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but he does not want it, while the spectator feels he has to stay with him but he does not want to. A film about Italian politics and elections might be fascinating, but this film is not the same. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outside the Communist Party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to run with party party leaders, but it is characteristic of this film that we never get to see them. Interpreted with Moretti's political ravages are the events that led to the birth of his son, and then his homework with the child and later with the child Pietro (the film draws us through several years and more than a single electoral period). We expect to see a certain definitive sequence or convincing argument, but they never come. For one doubt I could have the patience to ever see a Nanni Moretti movie. He manages to make an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
