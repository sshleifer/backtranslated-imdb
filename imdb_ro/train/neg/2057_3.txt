I'm sorry I'm going against the flow, but I thought this movie was unrealistic, boring and too long. I'm tired of looking at Gene Rowlands long struggling with himself and the crisis he had lived. Perhaps the film has a cinematic value or represents an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment I would like to have missed it.
