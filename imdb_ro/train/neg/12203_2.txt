I think it's time for John Rambo to continue his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is aging, and Rambo is no longer a solidary but a cold-blooded murderer. Always turned on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be, and sincerely, I was tired of Hollywood, making her look the way it was. This is not the worst of the movies about Vietnam, which enjoys the honor of John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo wearing around a 50-horse-weapon car, considering what appears to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a large number of Russians is an insult to track. What's worse is the Rambos cheese speech at the end of the year ... Please! Yeah, I heard I was doing something else ...
