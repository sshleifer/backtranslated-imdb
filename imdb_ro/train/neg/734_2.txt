This movie was stupid with a capital "C." The opening scene showed the promise. But that "promise" was interrupted shortly after the spectator had learned where the plot was going. And the wooden statue, Morty, who was pretty creepy in the original film, looks stupid in this. It was so obvious a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And, by the way, who thinks that "Morty" is one of the most remarkable names on planet Earth? He was there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value: Henry-freakin'- Kissinger. "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as frightening as "Morty." And then there is a scene where the heroes of his father's tombstone with a "stick" could you guess - "two by four?", someone might venture ... No, he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a branch - a branch, worse than then, once the characters move away, There's also an American guy who lives with grandparents of the main character but apparently does not do anything Morty-maintenance, he perpetuates Morty scary legends, warns those who beat, and even sets Morty's arm when it is damaged during a p but for all respect and sensitivity to Morty, does not Morty give a rat back behind? The film is shooting and, in the end, more people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears. This movie is a real kidnapper. Do not rent it.
