Captains were by far the biggest load of nonsense I've ever lost time to look at. This show based on Geico ads is less fun, then a real 30-second ad for Geico. The makeup was half inclined to say at least a hard-to-imagine cavourite with white prefects, even after going to the dentist. This show might have the potential for a funny series if it could get the distribution from the commercials, which means it's a bad show itself. Perhaps if the writers were the same from the Geico ads, this could have a chance, but the pilot did not have a good story line. I gave this show a 1 in 10, I would love to put a zero out of 10, but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death at this show, I would give it less than 5 episodes before we die a meritorious death.
