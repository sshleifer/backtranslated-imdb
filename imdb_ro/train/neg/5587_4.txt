In addition to the "Tarzan" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs has written many other books, although, besides the popular "At the Earth's Core," few of them have been filmed. An exception is the novel called "The Lad and the Leu", screened under the name of "The Lion Man" (1936), an over-speaking, static, old, slow-moving and rather boring film, despite shooting in places real desert. In fact, the movie is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but it is carried out in a snail's rhythm in a row of robberies. For example, at least five characters are given to the elaborate opening scenes and then disappear. Even more frustrating for the cinema fan, there are the characters who make an impression of the kind (like the one dealing with Hall with the wine-cracked wine), but they are adopted by players who are not credited! Loyal creditors generally come worse than the unknown. An exception is Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good picture of the kidnapped harem girl saving the young Master Fairy. Of course, most of the casting is loaded with an atrocious dialogue of King James, which must be heard to be believed! But the way to play this garbage is "tongue in cheek", a stratagem, which does not appear to have appeared in any of the movie films of unattractive players. Perhaps the director of J.P. McCarthy took this idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the wonderful Kathleen Burke forced to deal with Richard Carlyle (his father) and Jon Hall (her bearer). Of course, Mr Hall offers his lines with much more condemnation than Mr Carlyle, but that is not a recommendation.
