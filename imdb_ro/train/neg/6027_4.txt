I grew up Baptist and know the story this movie is trying to say, though I do not believe the story anymore. I will give the kudos movie because it's as good as the average movie of the week. Somewhat interesting, mediocre, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is digging and it's a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind must be the most squeakiest pure non-Christians ever. Not one damn word from any of them. But I laughed aloud when the actor who played the man who ruled the United Nations pronounced "nuclear" as "no-cu-ler," just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that mandates that, since Bush claims he is also called by God, all Christians must cover their ignorance by misunderstanding that word the way it does it? LOL! I really had a difficult time to take the movie seriously afterwards. After the "no-ler" incident, the film began to feel like manipulative and packaged propaganda. I was looking for something daring. Actually, I was looking for something to make me think, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you look for intelligence, look elsewhere.
