I, like many, saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in '97. At best, it was a film under the media, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all the "Titanic" fans want to do. First, DiCaprio is a terrific actor no matter how you look at him. People like it very much because of its appearance. His "abilities" to act in essence consists in saying a lot of lines of cheese and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple behavior: the girl falls in love with a guy, a ship on the sinks, a lot of love scenes afterwards. Anyone with an IQ over 50 will realize that this is not ingenious in any way. Nor is it original. In addition, the director felt the need to shoot him for 3 hours. I could compress it in a block of 1 hour without losing any plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. Why he has so much attention, and the money is beyond me.
