Very dense road movie with a comic relief offered by excellent John Cleese (though he actually sends his show to Fawlty Towers). It seems to go down over the paper to a sordid sentiment at the feet of a hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn have to "find" who they are, etc. See this at your dangers.
