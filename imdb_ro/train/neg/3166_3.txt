I confess that I have a feeling of anxious feeling about ghost films, and while sometimes enjoying the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they have to be crazy to be funny. "Over her dead body" seems to take my life after death a little too seriously and fails in my opinion in almost every aspect I can think of. The story is of course unbelievable, and she could not convince me either in the comic book or in the sentimental register. The choice of the main actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy, the taste of his character's lady seems to need a serious improvement because Eva Longoria seems too old for him and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (I'm sorry again). A romantic story without enough reason for a love story is due to the failure of the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they only had supporting roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat cinema and cheap gigs borrowed from TV comedies unsuccessfully. Nothing worth watching, nothing to remember.
