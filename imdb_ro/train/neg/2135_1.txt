Just the garbage completely. I'm a big fan of Cusc, this is the only reason I've watched this movie, but the only reason they can see their presence was the restoration, totally and in deeper quality, of their exact roles at Grosse Point Blanc. Besides, the role of movies as a political satire fails to be miserable as being too obvious for even the most moronious there to serve any purpose. And billing him as a satirical satire would even be insulting even for the chimps. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as this is not anything near Grosse Point Blanc in the same league that meet the Spartans on political satire allows you to leave well enough alone and to let it fade into the obscurity it deserves.
