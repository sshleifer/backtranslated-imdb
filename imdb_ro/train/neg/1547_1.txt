I could call many funny movies. There are comedies that are expected to be fun and are. Some movies, like Gymkata, for example, try to be serious, but it ends funny. Ladies Man is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but it would not be less fun if it were a guy who got a lot of chickens in the middle of destroying a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-funny. I do not think I laughed more than a chick at nothing in this movie. It's just unhappy. It's boring, stupid, unusual, annoying, awful bad, but not funny. I do not care about Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I expected better than that. The film is completely devoid of logic or common sense. It is that the scripture writer has a bag over his head while writing and can not see which keys he hits. They say the "origin" of the lady, but they do not include a motivation for its bizarre fascination to act as if it were still seventy. The movie is trying to get the humor of a man who seems to have fun in porn shortly after trying to hang out. Is this the comedy? I like to think of a sense of humor (I spend a lot of time writing comedy like me), but maybe I'm not bright enough for this movie. Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in "There's Something About Mary" is bad scandal here. We talked with him in the head to shut up. In the end, I was banging on my chair, mumbling under my breath, and if the movie went on, she would probably have tried to commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen is coming. <br /> <br />
