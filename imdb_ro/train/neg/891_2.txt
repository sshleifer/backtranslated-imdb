After I loved "Paris, Je T'aime," I anticipated this film very much and admit that I entered with great expectations but was very disappointed for several reasons. Though I did not expect a re-composition of New York's "Paris", I was expecting the same structure. What I liked about "Paris" was the separation of neighborhoods. You have a sense of each director style and the story they wanted to say. In "NY," there is no clear separation of stories at different points in the movie, the characters from different stories meet each other, which made me confused about who I was watching and what was happening. Also, switching to targeting was obvious but confusing because there was no flow. Another thing I loved about the movie "Paris" was the one of love. It was not romantic. It was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle-aged woman, desiring love, etc., explored so many layers of complexity of love among men. "NY" seemed to be heading for an exaggerated sexuality above the top. There were some shorts (the older couple spent a life together, shorts to Julie Christie), but generally the movie "NY" did not cause me any emotion. I did not connect with any of the characters like "Paris". I remember looking at "Paris" and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, desire, hope, wonder ... just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie "NY". Perhaps if I had entered it without having "Paris" stuck behind my brain as a comparison this film could have caused a more favorable response, but as a resumption of "Paris, Je T'aime" in its own name, I was very disappointed.
