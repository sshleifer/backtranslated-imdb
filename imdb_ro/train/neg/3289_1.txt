I'll say what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to destroy one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need a re-make of a big screen? Did the fans ask? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they made a remake of the Rocky Horror Picture Show with actors such as Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, they took out all the music and made it a drama. You think he would want that! This movie does not have the same sense of the original. Certainly the original was sometimes a bit strange, but Bo and Luke were always cute, intriguing because they were always ready to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people who were passing through the city. None of these things was important to the people who made this film, but they could not even have seen the original show until now. My big question is: what will they still ruin?
