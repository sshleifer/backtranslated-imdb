STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of Che films moves the story forward to the late 60s , where man now moved his resistance fighters on the hills of South America, surviving without food and water and tensions between the group. Everything comes close to the head when the border crosses to Bolivia and government forces intensify their campaign to bring it down. Without making the transition from time to time, the second installment of Soderbergh focuses only on the action of the hills, and it is an even more dull experience. Even more pretentious, the score was drowned, giving the second rate more an unwanted art of air, which turns out to be equally alien. There is only an unbreakable boredom for the movie that never leaves. You can not make the ambition of Soderbergh or Del Toro in the lead role, it's just a shame that somewhere in production things have made such a disappointing return. **
