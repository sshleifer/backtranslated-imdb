Absolutely nothing happens in this annoying warrior, thriller without emotion, directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator, Mateo Gil. The film, which somewhat deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for emotions, does not offer at all and seems to be an exercise in boredom. The only slightly suspending moment is the highlight of the film, which takes about 30 seconds of the 100-plus agglomeration plus, and is solved too easily. The plot does not have a sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary, and each plotting or twisting device is the result of an external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show an initiative or inventiveness. If you are a fan of the genre, watch "Tesis" instead.
