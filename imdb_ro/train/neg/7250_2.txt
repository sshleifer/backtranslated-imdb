After reading the other reviews for this movie, I think that big markers are probably paid for studios, because the movie I saw was absolutely terrible, with wooden action, unclear scripts and predictable directions, one of the few points plus the amazing landscape, given that this film features some amazing backdrops with wonderful views and dramatic waves and a wide opening, unfortunately when the most memorable thing in a movie is the part presented behind the actors, it must to be a warning sign on the quality of the film, all in addition a completely insensitive addition to the Western genre which, even at the very reasonable price it can get on DVD, is best avoided.
