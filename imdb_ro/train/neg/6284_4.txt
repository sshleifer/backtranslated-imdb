I liked the initial premise of this movie, which made me hunt it, but the problem I found quickly is that someone knows very well what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the doubles will come from behind the mirror and ). There is no real twist (which is good), but final disclosure does not make much sense (how can it be endowed with uncertainty and fear for the whole movie if it is a diabolic idol beyond the mirror?). Of course, "beyond the mirror" scenes have cooled when they first appeared, and killing the blonde is also creepy, but it finally seems to be a movie looking for a more appealing story or script that throws atmospheric atmosphere, and the scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not cut it, in fact, it becomes quite boring.
