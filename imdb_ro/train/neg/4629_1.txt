Obviously made to show the famous talent of Misty Ayers, striptease, of the 1950s, "acting." Too bad she can not act. The boring story of sweet and innocent Sally Down (Ayers) being drugged and forcibly slaughtered in white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets Tommy Cole, who immediately falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape, but can he? It really will not matter. There's no real skin here - Ayers shout down with the underwear (twice). The rest is just a little, boring, bad action story, a "comedy" atrocious (it was never thought that prostitution was fun, but what do I know?) And a terrible post-duplicated dialogue. I admit that there was a twist at the end I did not see, but it's not enough to stick with it. Also, Ayers' attempts to act are hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
