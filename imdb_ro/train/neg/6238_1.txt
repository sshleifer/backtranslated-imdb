Man, it's amazing how one can claim that global warming is a science, okay, I think this elusive stupidity now replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore tries to make this problem complicated, even if he needs the common sense to see that everything is a big joke by a man with his own money program! How did scientists estimate the historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the activity on the spot in the sun. Has no one ever asked if this method was correct? No, not even Gore! So how did it not be right to predict future sunlight if it was accurate in the past? According to the on-site activity, the temperature is today in line with what it should be. Why has the temperature in the whole universe increased (relatively) the same as the earth? Are our SUVs driving temperature rise on Jupiter? Use good sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to discover that this can only be a HOAX. Please, look at yourself. What does Al Gore and his friends ellipse like Rothschild (the banking family who arranged a live event of the earth) to win from it? Well, the new world bank will rely on carbon credits, which are taxed on everything that gives up CO2 omissions, and it is easier to get rid of these taxes if people are attracted to believe it is to save the world when it's just about money, centralized control and more power for elitist bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is it noble to volunteer to pay carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes to its own company? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blindly, do your own research and use your own common sense and I'm sure you will come to the right conclusion!
