Why am I doing this constantly for me? I mean, it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else did I expect? I have to admit I'm a sucker for everything I find on the Monster HD channel, but the only redemption feature of this image would be a really grotesque makeup work by the legendary Rick Baker. As for the creepy, I'm gonna give him this old crunching jerk who sucks the lemons right before the lights. Now they were really scary. Something I never realized in horror films was the reason why the victims of a monster would not simply run away when they were confronted with virtual annihilation. Like the boobs in the cabin. You know, it was a completely visible door right there in the kitchen that it could have gone out of the way. The incredible Steve-O could not find much more than a lively walk, why not blow it yourself? I do not know, maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> This movie had a sense of an episode of "Tales From The Crypt," but "Tales" usually had a grotesque or grotesque twist that you have not seen. This was a single image that you could not do with your hand on coming or going. For example, in an early stage, can you clearly understand that Melting Man's eyeball has fallen, as it has eventually managed to get to the rest of the story? I think we should not ask. At eighty-four minutes, this image was about an hour and a half too long. When he was everywhere, I was ready to pick General Perry on his previous suggestion - "I could really use a drink."
