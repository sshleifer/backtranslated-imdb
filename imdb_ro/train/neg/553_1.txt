After I look forward to the end, I have to say that I would like to not join the whole series first. The last episode was everything against the last seven years. It destroyed everything. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to cut him ... say, just seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crew members died all along the way. Why does he want to save only the Seven of the New? The others do not matter or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew says that getting home is not really the most important thing for them. As they say, "the journey is more important than the destination." Unbelievable. And at the final stage they are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst of all.
