But, leave it in front of me ... it took some nostalgic sighs from me. The show is as consistent as it is allowed to have a few hiccups. I have a new season, and only the power through them as I have two days to live. I like the idea of ​​packing it, but it was much more a season ending season that would explain the following: Dr.Cox should not be bald for yet a few episodes, only the explanation I can think of is that they changed the rotation episodes or had to reprofile the beginning. And my friends are why bald key is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is great ... it brings on Season 7.
