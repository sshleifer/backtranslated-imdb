Bizarre told Cinderella. Extremely poor scenario, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent performance, mother-in-law. Amazingly visual from some parts, but that's all about that. The vintage costumes range from the Elizabethan period to the 1990s. Quickly until you see something interesting and save all your 90 minutes of motion. If you are really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest "Ever After: A Stindard Story" or "Glass Slipper".
