Tyson Appearance: 1.33: 1 Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Reverent - though scrupulously correct - account of the life and times of boxing champion Mike Tyson. Considering his belief in a rape allegation, the film is careful not to portray him as a hero or a villain, but he has a black portrait and all the portraits of his rise to fame, the pressures of success and the people who shaped their destiny for good or bad. Constrained by time limits, the script goes through a series of relevant details, avoiding briefly important events, culminating in Tyson's temporary decline in 1995. Novices will be chronologically lightened, while boxing fans will be entertained by the director Uli Edel's approach to the material. He portrays Tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves the biggest part of the venom for Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, who characterizes her as an ungrateful golden monk who took advantage of his naivety. Production values ​​are solid uniforms and the distribution is superb: Michael Jai White makes a correct imitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays the role of Tyson's mentor, Cus D'Amato, through his teeth of toothpicks; and Paul Winfield was certainly born to play Don King!
