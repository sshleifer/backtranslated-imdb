When the movie began the first 4 minutes seemed to be a California traveler, I was wondering if I took the mixed tapes. Then I inspired a relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is followed by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior, so he hires a private professor (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, role robot or incest aspects. There's a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. My degree: D +
