Visibly agglomerated, less plot, incredibly mindful garbage. Not even close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid all costs! Surprised effects on the screen only confuse, the film is very dark for much of the time, and the "artistic" composition of images is pretentious to the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even nudity is incredibly unerotic, and they see that much of the movie gets very dull. In addition, how can anyone say that Ewen MacGregor's acting is bright is beyond me. He showed more abilities in the Star Wars series, and that says something. I have not been so unprinted with a movie since I saw "Darby O'Gill and Little People"!
