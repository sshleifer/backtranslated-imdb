I've waited a long time to see the DARGEON of DR TARR and after I watched him, I was very disappointed. Not the baroque movie I expected to be. The trailer (which I saw on DVD Something Weird) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgotten. There is almost no scene in it and the look is interesting, but it does not even come close to other baroque films from there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and almost nothing dramatic happens, even if we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. The main problem with DUNGEON TORTURE OF TORT was that it was - More than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood, or something, instead of seeing / listening to the main characters who would endlessly talk about boring things. A missed opportunity.
