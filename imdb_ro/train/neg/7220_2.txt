Where do I get the money to make such movies? I mean, there is nothing to redeem about this movie. None of the actors is known, the writing is terrible, the photo is unclear, the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a Western nicklodeon, and the acting is unbelievable. For someone who watches all kind of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is about the worst thing I've seen since the 50's eye attack. I do not like to destroy the effort of people who are trying to create entertainment or, heaven, forbid art, but this film does not seem to appeal to anyone. The story goes to a mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul, though it works more like a male succubus without sexual meanings. Bad guys have to join the good boys in a city where they can not escape. Take it from there, for, unfortunately, it is the best part. My advice is that if you are not in bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing drives and boring settings, you will be best served by leaving it on the shelf when you are renting videos.
