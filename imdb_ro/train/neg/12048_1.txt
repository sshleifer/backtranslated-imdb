I've been out of the 6 movies all my life. This was one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. I do not know how I spent an hour on it. I was probably in a coma that night. I saw her in the theater when it was 8 years ago. I did not even remember my name, but I knew Penelope Ann Miller played in it. Probably really affected me to waste my time commenting today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
