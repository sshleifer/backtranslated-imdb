Sogo Ishii can be filmed in fair conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a Genji spit. The film has the main features of a low-budget production, including blurry scenes and clumsy mounts (the type you can find in a sub-product run). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit guarding the bridge at Gojoe at night, but he does not realize that this decision will directly conflict with almost every element of society at that time- he could win his enlightenment. There is, however, no lack of ambition in describing the conflict between the holy and the worldly. Artsy blooms in some photos and edits help to offset the free-of-charge shooting. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
