This is the worst movie I've ever seen! There was absolutely nothing to say about this movie. I've seen some bad movies, but that's it. There's no plot and most of the movie you're promoting either fast, either to make it faster or you wonder what the hell is going on because you can not really think that someone has thought about this movie and you're watching it. I'm sorry for anyone who needs to stay in this painful hour and half. Please take my advice and you DO NOT see this movie because I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time ever spent in your life.
