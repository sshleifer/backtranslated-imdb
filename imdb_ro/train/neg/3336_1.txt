This movie was so predictable. It is a complete rupture of the "I was abused by my father that I will kill the women's movies." Silly speculations, bad action, a non-original story, a really low budget piece. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on people. Believe me. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0 / 5.0
