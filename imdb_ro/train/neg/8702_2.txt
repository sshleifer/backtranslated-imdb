This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it after seeing the first two, but I'm still warming up on these types of movies with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it this time." No - not even close. Where do I start? What about the special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what goes on for SFX in this movie, at one point a soldier pulls a "Raptor" as he leaks over a hallway. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that he is just a man with a seemingly bandaged tail that runs around him. Bad bad bad bad. How about acting? If that's what you can call him. There is a character who, I suppose, should be from the south. However, after living in the South for six years, I have never heard this way of speaking. Perhaps he has a kind of strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing to force her to have this accent - that's why there is no reason the actor should try to do that. How about the question? It's pretty simple - Raptors escape, people with weapons have to hunt them down. I'm beginning to wonder why dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest tunnel system ... would not they stay outside to hunt the prey? Well, at least they have the common sense to appear very little in the movie that is supposed to revolve around them. Other Things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there are people who eat raptors running around it. Have you decided to take time to have an argument about who's better - the Army or the Marine? And then you decide to have a fight contest to solve the problem? How about the idiotic idea that raptors have to see - Divide into groups of two. Have not ever seen horror movies (Or at least one Scooby Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the terrible movies there. Unless you want to ruin a movie.
