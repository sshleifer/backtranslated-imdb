Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to straighten. Maybe she should go back to acting ... on the second thought she was a bad actress. Who would put money to produce something so bad. I like anti-Christ movies, and I usually have a good laugh and a strange scare, but this is just Bad Bad Bad. Star action was worse than what you found in a soap opera. The special effects, if you can call it that, where it's ridiculous. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion and see the tubes that the blood pulls out of. We had to stop the disc after only 30 minutes. These so-called original movie films should be destroyed, all discs and cassettes destroyed and all the people associated with making the film have to pay money to the people who rented the movie. Then people should never be allowed to act, direct or shoot anything other than their own home movies
