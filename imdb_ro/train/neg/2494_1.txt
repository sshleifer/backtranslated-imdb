What a joke. I'm looking at Channel 1 and I think seeing the dry paint is a lot more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien, who swallowed him in this nightmare. Terrible acts, a very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of suspense, but more of a comedy. If you want to see a terrible act, a ridiculous scenario script and a sub-par paragraph, check out this movie. If I was Van Dien, I would not just ask 10% of my agent, but I shot the bastard in the trial. What a turkey. It's not even fit to be on MST 3K! It would be a good movie to cure your insomnia. I love him especially where the Van Dien is thrown overboard and then it's back in just a few minutes! I can only believe that this was written by non-union writers who took advantage of the writer's strike. What a terrible movie!
