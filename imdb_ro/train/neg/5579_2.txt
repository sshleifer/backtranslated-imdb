The 60s is an occasional fun movie, most of this entertainment is from laughter to film. It is extremely unequal and includes many annoying elements. Take, for example, switch between black and white and color. If it had done well, it could be quite effective, but because it was badly made, it turned into a challenge and was just degraded by the already bad experience; much of the movie had a strange feeling. The actor was not extremely bad for a movie made for television, but then he was again embarrassing again. Many of the events were not coherent and ended up being confused. How has this family come to some sort of way in many of the great events of the 1960s? The end was too feeble for my tastes; because she was hollywood, everything was supposed to end in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time in the 1960s and do something else with time. I'm glad I looked at this in class and not in my time. I think I can say for sure that the best part of the film was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my thoughts in the movie. I hope you get my advice and stay away from it.
