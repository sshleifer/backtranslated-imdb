A mistaken attempt to rip the "Seven" film, supplemented by secondary action, horrible camera work, a half-bite story and a strong blade propaganda taste. Yes, they are "sexual offenders," they live next door and you will be raped, indeed. There are no surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always - as convincing as a wooden piece. Richard Gere continues to slide below and below - and is about as low as a late Steven Seagal. The song of a woman with crazy eyes is best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was sub-par (although it was the best interpreted in the film) - maybe they fed it before photos or something like that. Unlike "Seven," but which was interesting, which may be more or less related, regardless of country, this film seems to focus on obsession in the United States alone. If someone does not care too much about "sexual offenders" - and the statistics are that lack of exercise and poor diet cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see or be afraid. > <br /> <br /> There are some body fetishes and some beatings, but the gore is less mediocre and fails both as an artistic device (because it is useless) and as a gore, because it is not bad enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this.
