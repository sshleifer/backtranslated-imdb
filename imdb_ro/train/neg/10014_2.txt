I saw this movie in a drive-in 1959. Up to "Howard the Duck" we consider this movie the worst I've ever seen. This movie tried to combine all genres into one; comedy, horror, adolescent enthusiasm, and the hot bastard that would have come "My Mother, the Machine". Maybe it's worth a second watch to see if it's an accurate reflection of time.
