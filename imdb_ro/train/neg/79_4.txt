The original book of this was established in the 1950s but this will not be done for the television series because most people look at the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the tube-by-end train was a 1950s train, painted to look like a 1930s train, so the Underground can play that game. Suspension of the story on a story about the Jarrow Marsh was poor, but the version of the 1950s had students who had begun to think about the world around them, so I suppose that making them think about poverty is just the same thing. All the things Japp had to satisfy his self were also weak, but they had to put something to fill the time. That would have done a decent show for half an hour or could have filmed the book and made a better show. It is obvious that this episode is a victim of the style of content.
