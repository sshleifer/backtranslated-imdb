Ah, the boring t.v. shows and pilots that were shot together in the 1970s to make the same stones t.v. movies! Some examples are Riding With Death, Stranded in Space (confused and uninteresting), San Francisco International (awfully boring and incredibly confused), and this glamorous little quiver of Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you do not know from outside photos) is apparently a failed pilot for a spy show spy. The real problem is that you do not like most of the characters, including the main character, Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the whole movie; his boss "Aunt Maria", who had a really strange delivery of his threads and white hair, and a bronze that seemed to be stucco; Diamand Head girlfriend / colleague agent (hell, I do not even remember the name) a rough-haired woman with a flat way to talk that is not sexy or interesting; and Zulu (again, I do not remember the name of his character), which was not bad at low doses. The most exciting person in the entire production was Ian McShane, who was aspired as a bad guy, but he still proved his qualities. Besides the makeup jobs that this so-called "chameleon" used to hide, they were just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he is doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that made him dress up as a South American dictator as an American general. I do not even care. The plot was simply not interesting enough to keep you in mind for ten minutes at a time, not to mention an hour and a half or so. Call this one - Hawaii Five No!
