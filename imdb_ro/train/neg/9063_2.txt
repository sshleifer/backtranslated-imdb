The fact that most of the budget for this is supposed to have entered the heavy distribution list should not have been important if it was staged with flair and imagination and sympathy for the satirical intention of the original. Instead, we will get sequences of songs and dances quickly inappropriate, with beggars and scenic curves, and the final alienation is done by pulling back to discover that the action took place in a scene in the music room, adequate enough for a production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully used: Migenes and Walters are good, but they do not have to try very hard: Migenes has at least a great voice and a sense of material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but she struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake accent. Harris's peachum is embarrassing, and Polly is atrocious. The adaptation of lyrics, scripts, and music is often strange: it was a bad move to set Marc Blitzstein on the Broadway version of the film, but at least its words were broadcast, unlike most of what was interpolated in gestures faithfully. And trying to overcome the low budget by filming in claustrophobic angles on recessed music sets lit in blues and oranges, as if a Vittorio Storaro showcase failed entirely - the movie seems to be cheap, comfortable and indecisive. Shy.
