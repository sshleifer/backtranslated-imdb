Not long enough to be the characteristic length and not steep enough for a short, this exists for one reason only, to have a lesbian in three directions. There are more serious reasons to exist. A sad thing is that this could have made a decent film. Misty fits perfectly in her costume and is a very weird girl and when people are so in love with a character like Lara Croft that they make nudity calendars about her, you know a soft blow is set to explode. Unfortunately, this is quite pathetic. Especially the fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you see her hand, is for nothing. Watch this if you can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a beautiful blonde and has gods verst jerman akcent ever.
