These were over 80 minutes of semi-unexpected boredom. First of all, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like this. Then, reaching the 70th minute, I was convinced that it was only a few minutes and I lasted until the end of which I am quite proud, considering that I see this film as a great test for man's patience and tolerance. Was it worth watching? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it out and if you are quite desirable, you can even go to the end ... The film is inconsistent and the characters seem to have no sense common to all. All the happenings in the movie, you can rest assured that you have seen somewhere before and it seems they are put in this film just to fill the film drum.
