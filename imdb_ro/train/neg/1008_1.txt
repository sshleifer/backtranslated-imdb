Edison's story was decent, but an actor ruined, in particular, the entire movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed the movie with every line he spoke during the film. He is by far one of the worst actors I've ever seen and should face the same fate as the whole FT. team. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. You do not even bother to download it, pornography is a much better choice. And Justin, if you read this, stay with music. Even if you're not good at that, you've done a wonderful job cheating people to think you can sing.
