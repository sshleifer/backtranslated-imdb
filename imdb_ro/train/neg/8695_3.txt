Elizabeth Rohm was the poorest actress of the entire law and order of ADA, and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateur and unrealistic. She can not properly summon the intense emotions necessary to play the mother of a kid kidnapped; sometimes, while her daughter is missing, she only sounds vaguely tired, as if she does not remember where she left her keys. This is an important story, so it's too bad that the terrible act of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but it can not go beyond Rohm's tendency to simply embrace a particularly heavy imitation of a Southern route whenever effective action is needed.
