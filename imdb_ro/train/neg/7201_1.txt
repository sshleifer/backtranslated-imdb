Fortunately I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I can not reveal any spoiler, because I left voluntarily forty minutes of the movie. It was so bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! the panel fell on the guy, and the theme track appeared. However, just because I thought she was having fun, but I realized there was still another product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I looked almost religious. (although I lost the last episode, I heard Dr. Claw show and it was nothing but a bullet, someone commented on the show's page). The animated drawing had Penny and Brain much more than the movie, in terms of this point. I hated setting the whole thing, reminding Robocop. Then Broderick screws with all the feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not as clumsy as the cartoon. Another fact is that his gadgets work to the point I saw except the oil. He also screwed up the Wowsers tone, which had been in an emotional tone. I felt so disappointed they had sacrificed the drawing so badly. Everyone else felt that too. New children aged 14-17 years remember the cute cartoon and we loved every minute of it. I entered the film with an open mind, knowing she would be screwed up with cartoons. I was surprised at how retarded the movie was. It was based on visual bouts and a stupid humorous dialogue. Disney relies on physical pain and humor to push a children's film along. Placing products is useless in this movie and looks. The wise car is not so good at wise cracking. Gadgets look good, but they were almost too glossy. The drawing was a better look. The stupid scenes were stupid. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, did not hear a laugh and laughed at the preview of Dudley-Do-Right. This film should not be pursued by people who want intelligence in the entertainment of their family. I really recommend "The Giant Iron", which was sad, but very good. This film is a travesty of the whole family drama
