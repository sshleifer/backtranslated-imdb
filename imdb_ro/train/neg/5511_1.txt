I have to agree with the first comment: the movie is very, very difficult. Despite the fact that it has a very large B list, the cover of this movie (for those who do not watch Comedy Central during a week that is probably the only exposure this movie will ever have) tries to blame Dangerfield, but in fact it's just a salary for everybody it was-it was comic in the 1980s. Randy Quaid? Check it out. Ed Begley, Jr? Check it out. Lisa Simpson's voice? Now he can say that Maximum Overdrive was not his only horrible blow: double check. And so many, many more. The saddest thing about this movie is that it has been written so lazy with the jokes already said. Nothing about this movie beyond its existence is fun. You better look at the dry paint. This is definitely the direct-to-video-scraping-of-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video ad: throw an old star on the cover and get some money back off the rental. Since movie rental days are changing, consider one of the last examples of garbage. The only use of this movie is if you have trouble sleeping. He'll take you there.
