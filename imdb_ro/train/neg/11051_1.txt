A terrible movie that contains a lot of Canadian actors in list D who seem to be so aware that they are on the camera that their performances are too melodramatic and quite forgotten. This movie is badly written, stupid and ill-edited. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a wonderful job with what he's given, but he's the only one in the movie that makes it - he really has a story and an unpleasant script to work with. It's not even enough camp to be funny. We have not seen Van Pelleske acting in a credible way, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal voice, cheerful) confirm that we are on a crowd in Toronto, rather than on an African barge. The director did not see the "creature" look like a jazz dancer in a foreign costume? The struggle between the blue lightning and Pelleske's "magic" orange light (... For lack of a better word) is obviously the result of the bad actors, without a choreographer, overlaid with completely derived special effects. Was there even a director on the stage or in the editing room for this disastrous film (not the good genre)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... do not waste your time with this, you will regret it as we did it. I have nothing to say about this waste of celluloid.
