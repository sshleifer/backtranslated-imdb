Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master of this film. It was the brilliance of producing a movie with actors who could not act. Besides, he chose to write a script based on a bad acid journey that had a serious mistake. Put it together, you'll end up with a sucking film more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain it causes is roughly equal to the pain caused by the fact that the genital organs were carved with a spoon and then having the whole wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
