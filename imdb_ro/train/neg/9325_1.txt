SICK. Indeed, it means so incredibly crappy and they were killed. There was absolutely no action to talk about. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this film was sufficient. The film was under the sesame street. Production looks like underground shooting for mob blows. The props used in this movie were stolen from an apparel store. The end was so predictable that you should advance in the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a book out there for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid that at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that the whole movie deserved. Just kidding.
