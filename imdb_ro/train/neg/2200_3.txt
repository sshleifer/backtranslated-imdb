I like the films of the bad sharks. I really. I laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel had a marathon of them, culminating with the premier of their new original image, the hammer: the shark frenzy. based on previews, it looks very funny. essentially a remake of Benley's creature, indeed. has been prefaced by a shark attack show 3: megalodon, which is the movie of the hilarious shark at its best. I was able to; I was ready to go. bring him man, strange-mad scientist! oh god, this movie was wrong. wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> linen. MESSED UP. This is theoretical reproduction to very bad, my friends. when a drugged girl is taken out of suspended animation and bound to a table screaming at her head because the human-shark-fetal hybrid fetus, the absolutely crazy "scientist" deliberately implanted in her belly, wants OUT ... The monkeys of Jesus. that's what I call disturbing. In fact, how does the plot work: hmmm, thought the crazy scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining her with that of a hammer shark because the sharks are not giving up cancer, and other hammers are reproducing through the placenta. Oh, look! a perfect amphibian being! We have created the next evolution of the human race! KNOW! Let's make it reproduce! but darned if all the shark genes did not make my son thirsty; Instead of drinking the top bears, I continue to send them to the little jungle paradise, always eating it. but check this out! among the random people who, through undesirable upheavals, have reached my research island, is the woman my son was hired to before he died! I bet she'll do it! all this leads to a very emotional and sincere meeting: woman: will you impregnate me? crazy: no. he is. (indicates the shark in the tank), how sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. ever.
