Note: I will reveal an essential part of the plot, but if you looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you will already know it. This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old man who is not very bright and probably was very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and a body. Look at the fact that the UN and NSA seem to lead the show in Hungary. Remember that when these intelligence moves after someone whose touch will kill you in about a minute, they do not wear protective gear (no gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this movie. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. The fact is that the people in this film do (with a few exceptions) behave as human beings behave. Almost every time a character responds to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course, there is one) makes the soap scene look like Shakespeare. I can not believe I lost a free rental movie for this.
