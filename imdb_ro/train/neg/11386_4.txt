One of those documentaries of "Thank-God-I-dont live". This is about two war factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitaries and the peoples of Medellin. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs, and death are unfolding. Boys, no older than 22, not in the middle of a war fight, are in jail. Girls ?? not women, girls ?? always react in the same way when one of them is killed, with tears and screaming. You scratch your head; what did they really expect? I do not know what is most worrying: night shots and civil unrest, or that everyone seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing the boy drink what is not obviously his first beer, being everything, 10? If you should take any of these young people out of their situation and put them in a place where they had the opportunity to do more, be more, how many would they choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, I'm afraid.
