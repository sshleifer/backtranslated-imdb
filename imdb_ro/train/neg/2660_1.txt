However, the subject is an amateur, exhibitionist - or an effort to one - that is just as exciting and daring as a composition book of the poetry high school student. Of course, it will disrupt viewers who are inclined to be disturbed, but success will be attributed to them, not to the director. Getting really under someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film contains an evocative image, shown as a room (and used in the case of the video house), but without a development that leads to or away from it. If the director had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an exciting movie - a movie.
