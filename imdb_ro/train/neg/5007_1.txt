There is no reason to see this movie. A good idea about the plot is treated very badly. In the middle of the movie, everything changes and it makes little sense. The cause of the killings is unclear. The act is terrible. Nick Stahl needs a better director. He was excellent in the bedroom, but here's terrible. Buffy's Amber Benson has to change his character one day. Even those of you who enjoy free sex and violence will be disappointed. Even if the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for it), there are no deleted scenes on DVD, which means they never bothered to fill the missing parts with the characters. /> <br /> Do not spend time on this.
