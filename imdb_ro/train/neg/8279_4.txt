This movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason, it took the wrong way. Maybe he did not really know who his audience was, but it's hard to see a man's film about distribution and plot, yet he's too blonde and blonde blonde to appeal to women. If you've seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, then it's like the terrible awful continuation. Big actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have done much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are defeated in supporting roles that are rather stupid than funny. Many things in this movie were the painting of numbers, the various uber-clich√© mounts, last minute misunderstandings, and even the chaos of children's parties. This only suggests lazy scriptures. It should be possible to find this good movie if you do not take it seriously but it is a kind of trap it could do better than you probably will feel frustrated and more disappointed as scenes go through the past .
