This is very terrible. The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time I ask who's the worst vampire movie I've ever watched, I'd have an appropriate answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed at 35 mm, so it's already sticky like hell. I would not have bothered commenting, but I noticed that some fans (probably related to the film) claimed that it was the best Matrix movie. Allow me to discuss myths and lies. There is nothing good in the movie. Everything squeaks sticky. The actress is ugly. The battle choreography is the worst I've ever seen. The battle scene is incredibly amateur. Imagine a girl who throws her arms in a powerless circle and blows weak, which would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie. I know the director did not have too much budget for the movie, but the better movies were made with a smaller budget before. Unforgivable.
