I've finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I have to say it was a bunch of trash. The first three American songs were hilarious, the last three were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. As you've seen from the title of the movie, Beta House, it's about a fraternity, elders, girls, and the most original part of them, who fall in love. Of course, the guy who heads the chickens is Stifler, who, along with his colleagues, is trying to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It's very predictable, and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To summarize: horrifying act + boring script + misuse of franchise American Breast = total loss of time! This movie is unbearable. I give her two out of ten, although most of it sucked that there were many pretty nudes and beautiful girls, like two funny scenes :)
