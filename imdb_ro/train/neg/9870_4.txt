I had a few problems with the movie: (1) the script - in particular, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; they should * show * the action rather than have a voice over * to tell us what is happening. Occasionally I find a movie about the works, but here it seemed more like a lazy way to write the script. Actually, it seemed to me that she had practically read the fragments of the novel in her voice. (2) I did not feel any excitement in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and I also felt that Carter's Alex Act was bad enough. This is a significant failure for me in defining the characters of Jessie and Thomas - unrelated to each other, it seemed to me that he wanted only a stick and that it was a matter of sexlessness for him. If it had been done properly, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story. (3) With this book I understood the crisis of Jessie's life. In the film, it seemed rather a boredom. Plus, I did not think the movie was so bad to shut down the TV. . . though this thought occurred to me.
