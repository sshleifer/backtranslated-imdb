First, let me say that I am a great fan of Ashley Judd; so I was curious to check this, her role as a debut. No argument that her talent is obvious and her excellent performance. I also think that the critics of the professionals liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that the movies are meant to have fun and that's where the movie fails. Halfway down the road, I woke up thinking, "How long do we have to watch the bored girl shop, idiot standing around a desert souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise? It seemed to go on forever! Then, I think, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to deceive his audience in a relaxed state before grabbing them with a dynamic event.There is no luck.The film continues its gentle, boring, unequivocal story I'm not saying that because I'm a drug addict I like all sorts of movies, especially romantic comedies But I expect to be fun Add that cinema and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's home movies. I do not understand how anyone might want this movie. <br /> <br /> Zero-entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The longest 114 minutes of my life.
