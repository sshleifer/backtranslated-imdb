This is the most confusing entry on IMDb that I will not stop yet. All previous commentators act like this is the movie. This is not the movie. Rather it is just a feature that is an extra feature on the movie DVD "The One" Also, nowhere is it close to 90 minutes that is listed here as. In fact, just over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So give this IMDb entry is quite a little fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. This is the truth. I think I can say I'm the One Review that matters.
