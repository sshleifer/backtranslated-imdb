This movie may have been the biggest surrender I've ever experienced in filming movies based on IMDb reviews. Generally, I just realized that this is a movie of a different nature. Leslie Cheung is certainly acceptable, because the anti-hiro and Ma Wu deal with his cheerful character. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously false that I could not take it seriously. He showed that an overweight teenager dressed in Halloween, complete with a beard of $ 4.95. The special effects were so, although the "bunch" in the cellar was pretty good. The tongue appeared to be something of a mischievous move of the 1950s, although POV photos from the language perspective were more akin to the images of Sam Raimi in the latest Evil Dead trilogy. Pyrotechnics was ho-hum and the final battle is as boring as you can get. (In fact, it reminded me most of the episode "Lost in Space" where Robinsons are trapped in a sandstorm and ...). The plot was not particularly original and was often told as European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no overthrow of the plot. In fact, you know immediately that you are presented to the characters who are good, who is bad and who will survive. I just returned this movie to Netflix and then I sat down on writing this review. The first thing I did was check the date of production. Yeah, it says 1987 ... not 1967 that I thought it might be. And this is a summary: Production and FX values ​​are typical for the 1960s. The plot and the action seem much older because Hollywood actually produced some exciting and challenging movies in the 60's. <br /> <br /> ** *****
