This movie has a ransom feature. At one point, after a character is attacked by a fairy flying, his brother asks him: "Why is your dick in there, Chuck?" After nearly half an hour of bad film, it almost took my drink out of my nose. Some of the actors are not too bad, but the kids still smell and PJ Soles should be ashamed of herself to make this film. The story is weak and no one is doing what you think (or what dictates common sense) should be. Of course, there are lots of story points that are not added. For example, in one scene the ghosts of young children have to concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove that there is a difficult act because they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, a few minutes later, they all lift their branches from the ground and beat their teeth with them. It seems that matter can sometimes move and sometimes I can not. Go figure. A lot of blood and courage, though ... some pretty tits. But this does not match the shortcomings. If you want a movie about Tooth Fairy, go for rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, though many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it sets a mood.
