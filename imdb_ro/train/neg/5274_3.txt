If you like movies about cities, hotels, homes, states (such as the Eagles Hotel "California") that have "just passing" people, read almost every Stephen King novel. If you like the "Disappearance" setting, start reading King's "Despair", but also check "The Shining," "Salem's Lot," and "Needful Things." The reason, the family that desperates to escape or avoid possession is tired. Why did not they make the movie in the novel "Desperation"? Perhaps they approached the king and gave birth? Must be. Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin look happy that they are meeting and that both have been doing well over the years, but they are still TV actors and directly on the DVD.
