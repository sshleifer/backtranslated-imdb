The original "Running Point" was a great move. Subtle subtle, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preachy, obviously obvious; missed the point where the original was classic. The black charger was cold, but even that could not save that move. Why Staying With a White Challenger? I do not think it was the best choice in the '71s. Some parts of the movie were unintentionally hilarious. As if Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the canyon after "Dream Quest". His Indian friend was sitting next to him. Vigo wore only his white envelopes. I'm sorry ... just look stupid - looking for the Looms Fruit. Another scene was at the end of the year - after the explosive accident in bulldozers - the announcer said the impact was tacting at 180 mph. He then mentions that the police say that his remains were not found because he vaporized, but some think he saved himself out and was hidden by his friends in the crowd. Then he shows him he got out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you could not open the car door at 180 mph. Secondly, the car will not continue to travel in a straight line of 100 yds. with no one to lead it. It will run prompted more than 30 times. Third, if you left it on the sidewalk at 180 mph, you would have finished in different tracks. It does not matter, we see him at the end with his daughter. On the whole, a movie that would insult someone's intelligence.
