Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Bland, useless and still. Looks like Ash and co. can travel in time with "Forest Spirit" ("Mononoke Princess" a lot?) There they meet a Dorky kid called Sam, and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) rise with nature, become hippies and try to release Celebi ("Spirit") from a strange hunter. I do not even know what happened. Everything went unclear. Ash's friends were not in it, and all the battle scenes were boring. After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends have to go back on time while watching Sam go with Celebs was just creepy OO;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash finds out that the new his friend is actually the grandfather of his rival. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded, is not it? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this. (1 out of 10.)
