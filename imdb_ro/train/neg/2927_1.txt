Somewhere, there must be a list of the worst homosexual films made. One of them has long camera pictures of the stars that sit and stare in space, or where they focus unbearably long on cats cats eating spaghetti. This picture of the illness of the movement is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in the cave and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and talk and go, swim and have sex and drink and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then goes out and there's a lot of fast back and forth and there are long bad luck photos of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's kind of a technique to make gimmick movie or maybe the movie is so bad that it has to fill it with long, lost photos, otherwise if it should be based on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, it's about the 30th homosexual film I've been watching over the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) were very formal, predictable and boring, but it is a real waste the best thing so far has been "Thing Thing" So I followed this after the first opening debut that passed and stayed I thought "Oh, no, it will be creative Mah's sinful" I gave it a shot and saw it and then when it was over, I threw DVD in the trash. I'm sorry that I liked and if you did, I'm sorry if I offend.
