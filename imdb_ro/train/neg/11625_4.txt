With the exception of Brady Variety, it was one of the most hawkish televisions I've ever seen. The video production qualities were not too bad, but the appearance and general sense were undoubtedly the beginning of the '80s. And Marie Osmond looks as if he fought Avon Lady ... and he's been a long time. WAY too multicolored. It was a little embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid participate in this. Even more interesting was the pursuit of Alex Haley talking about the African Pavilion in the World Showcase that will open "in about a year." From this writing, it's 17 years later and it's not yet open (unless you count Disney's Animal Kingdom.) However, for all the shortcomings, this is still another interesting piece of interest in Disney history.
