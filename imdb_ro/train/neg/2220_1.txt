What the hell is in your mind? This movie is shit! Every minute I get bored more and more. I tried to look at the end because I hope there will be at least something! But instead, I was amazed at how boring the end was treated ... What is this story about this bloody "bogeyman"? How come he does not die? He is a bloody human being for God! A boy who killed his bad sister 15 years ago. Then what ? His state in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This movie is fascinating of the bad ... It's a mustache of humility. I'm going to retell it right now to a bad guy who will understand this movie stupidly.
