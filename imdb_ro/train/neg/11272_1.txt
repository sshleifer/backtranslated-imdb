... the first movie I was supposed to take. And it was the pre-screening of the cast and crew (Not that I was involved, I rush to add). I did it in the first hour, so I think I'm qualified to comment, but that was my limit. Like other comments here, how did I have to go through any kind of AQ. An accumulation of the worst in dialogue, symbol of the act of wood, casting terrible, all wrapped together without a plot. Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost comical. It has the worst Russian accent in the history of the film. As we left the show, the director and the producers were beating in a bar outside the cinema. They obviously have never been able to sit again again
