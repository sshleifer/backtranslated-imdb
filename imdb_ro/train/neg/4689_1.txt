The really terrible film made by scriptwriter director Ted Tetzlaff. Pretty decent film, but for a time bomb full of no tension. Ford, as somebody put it here, looks at sleepwalking, although it has a characteristic character. There are a few details thrown around - ex-Canadian army or RAF, defusing bombs in war, his wife leaves him - but none of these stories add up too much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is this shipment trying to explode me? So, what time have we been talking about here? World War II or post-war? I've assumed the latter, which makes the bomber even more important. Generally, however, just a horrible movie. There are plenty of time bombs to jump over. Watch any episode in "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time at about the same time.
