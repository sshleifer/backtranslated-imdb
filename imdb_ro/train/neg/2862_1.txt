Someone has to send this guy from Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? Can anybody make movies these days? In the past, it has always been necessary TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this BTK film and the others that it did, it seems obvious that the poor guy has almost all kind of business that makes movies like me. Actually I think I could really make movies better than Uli LAME-ALL. This film has nothing to do with the BTK killer other than the names of the victims and the killer. ASTA E. Where was this guy the big idea that BTK killed people with the rodents and all the other nonsense in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to get people to watch their movie on the basis of the "BTK" because of the fame it got. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie that I would consider is that the "DAHMER" movie blades. The child who smoked so many cigarettes made me sick. Whoever did this must be shot.
