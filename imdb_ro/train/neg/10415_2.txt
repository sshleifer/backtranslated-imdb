2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that's too generous. I thought with a play by James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how he might be missing. I was wrong. I can not ask what kind of drug Sam Shepard was at the end of the week, he lowered this piece of dribbling. I have long suspected that Sam S. is a kind of nut, this film, based on his play, confirms it. This is the genre of artsy b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth because they give them the chance to emulate endlessly. However, for the spectator who is in this dumb trash, there is absolutely nothing to love this movie. You have not seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this pile. Pa is crazy, he is mad, the son is mad and the daughter is, oh yes, mad. They also have mouths on them that speak words that would make a sailor's shadow, especially the adolescent daughter. Besides the above, as if it were not enough, the intrigue - and it is so thin, you could read it completely - has a hole in it of the size of Alaskai. He conspires to sell his rundown farm. As it turns out and so is Pa. Now I'm not claiming to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, the jointly owned property must have the owners' signatures to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not sell it legally, so it would make sense for that person to do so. Mister. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work. Not that something else really worked anyway. The only possible reason anyone have to watch this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity and I can not imagine why anyone would want.
