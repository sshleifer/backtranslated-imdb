Inexpensive, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller," in which student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident that sustains her lover's life, Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <> I can not begin to tell you how bad this is ... nothing ever happens and there is no real value of entertainment. I did not like this cast in this particular movie - all are sadly unconvincing (again, their roles are not good). Promoting this movie as a horror film is a joke. Where are you scaring? There's no sense or suspense - there are some good songs, but that's about it. How has this project done on Earth with the green light project? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no vision or talent to feel. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie useless. The alleged "killer cut" that I looked at is 86 minutes of pure boring.
