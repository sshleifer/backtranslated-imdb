A collection of deleted scenarios and alternatives take, edited together and adding voice over to make it seem to take place after the events of the first. Pretty cool idea, but deleted scenes are left on the floor of the cutting room for a reason, and this is a further proof. Because it's not as fun as Anchorman, and really recognize that the movie was no comedy gold, so you have a worse movie than a moderately funny one. In my eyes, STILL places it with one or two notches over "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Raise your fingers as "The Nesting Crashers" is a return to the old school form (without any word game) <br /> <br /> My degree: D
