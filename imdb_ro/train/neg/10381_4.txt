The sweet thriller of haunted houses finds an American family moving to a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent triumph of suicide murder took place. <br /> <br /> The new frame is the only element of interest in this horror movement that is moving very slowly by the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat embarrassed scenes that rarely seem to lead anywhere in the world. An obvious example is a fairly early scene in which the male leader visits a temple after realizing that his home is haunted, as the monk has warned earlier. The monk tells the story of the house (which the spectator already knows from the opening sequence), and then the film simply moves away from something else. Previously the monk offered to help. Where is the help? The family continues to remain in the haunted house as things get worse and worsen and no mention of the monk is done until the end, when he returns again to do what he should have done an hour earlier - try to lead the spirits in the house, although at this moment it is difficult for the spectators to take care. There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs to see the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly you start to make martial arts inappropriate, probably say the scene is more than a small reminiscence of the chain duel from the same director, Motel Hell, which was more obvious to be funny, but in general this is a forgetful dud.
