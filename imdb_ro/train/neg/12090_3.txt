Although I can see the potential qualities of redemption in this film through his intrigues, I certainly thought the painful nature of the length in the way she played the scene was too much to ask most viewers. The enormous thoughts in the script, such as never explained "your father has died today" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to understand these characters. This won first place in Cannes in 2001, which is a shock. Perhaps the French were hungry for the noir movie that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the spectator as incomprehensible as possible, but when it matched the inability to relate to the main character, it went too far for me and kept me away from my arms to the story entirely. <br /> <br /> This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of the movie Noir and one who does not expect any thanks for watching a movie once it's over. I loved films such as "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were more disturbing, but at least they gave the viewer something in the way of editing and rhythm. To watch these slow and painful teachers, after the scene, the scene became so redundant that I realized it was tiring - and I even wanted to like this movie every step.
