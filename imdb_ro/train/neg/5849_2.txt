Being a fan of silent movies, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the film seems to be a long, long, commercial car for Maxwell. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the tracking scene was about half the length it has, I might have enjoyed the movie more. But he got drunk very quickly. And while I admit that reality is often stretched in movies, without diminishing the joy of the spectator, what was the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're tracking a car through the mountains, a car moving more than one thousand kilometers an hour, but they can not catch it?
