I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew from the second 1 that it would be a piece of **** and you'd better avoid it, but I got in the way I saw this from some friends, we went into cinema with poor expectations, but we were hoping there would be some cheap laughs to keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" of this film make a whisper on the face, they are mostly composed of people who face blows and balls, the child looking strange and acting as a horny gang and the typical jokes we see so often in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious, and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and boring. Characters are extremely annoying and highly stereotyped. I never want to see this movie again ****, I'd prefer to take a bullet to my feet than to ever be exposed again to this piece of wood. If someone I see says he likes, I'll hit them physically
