I rented it because the second segment traumatized me like a small kid. I sank one morning early one morning, started to look at HBO, and The Raft (Segment 2) terrified me well. This time, I still enjoyed The Raft, although I could not tell if it was nostalgic or if it was actually a short short. The other two segments were garbage. I can not believe a producer somewhere paid to do this junk. All I did about looking at this was to destroy another childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad in my list of classic stray kids. 4/10
