The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page is collaborating in this movie. It does not even appear until two-thirds of the film ends and then its minor role. I do not think it is a supportive role, but rather a "little" part. Also, the plot has many unexplained elements. Here are some examples: Why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why does her youngest son drive on the train? He says it's for a "sucker" bet that does not explain anything. Obviously, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This movie is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on the TV if you think it should be seen.
