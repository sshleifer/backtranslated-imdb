I've been to Nine Dead recently and I've read the current reviews, thinking I could handle an average movie. However, the film was slightly below the average but could be tracked. The script was inadequately written, and the act was, on average, for a B-level film, with a couple standing up being pretty good. The land is bordered by Saw's, it teaches people what they have done wrong in a situation and tries to make them appreciate more life, but exactly where the comparison ends. Nine dead try to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main mistake we found in the nineteen dead was the fall in front of the flashback spectator that took place 3 minutes before in the movie and was completely useless and a completely inadequate end that people would not see coming in -A bad way. Barring any spoilers I have seen worse of bad movies and even they did not end this badly. Running decent, bad acting and ending though ...
