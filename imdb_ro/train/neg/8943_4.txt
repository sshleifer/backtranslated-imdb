John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in Indian territory and for Martha Scott's attention in Republican Pictures, shot in Utah, United States. An interesting western of sorts due to his more modern characters, with Wayne & Dekker playing old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-wrote the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell is heading in a work-like manner that fits his career. A fairly bright story is actually saved by its third end, where fortunately the action rises and we are treated to something like a pulse. The easy approach of the heart to the romantic component is not fair enough and a glorious fight between the two protagonists is destroyed by Rogell being unable to conceal men working stunts. But, hey, the stunts always deserve the moment of glory. Strong support comes from George "Gabby" Hayes and Wayne, as usual, has a lot of screen charisma, especially when he misses the gun. But despite its better budget than usual, it remains a film of interest only for the Wayne enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4/10
