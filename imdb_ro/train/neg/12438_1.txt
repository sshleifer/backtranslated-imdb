Beating Bad Boys ... Again is the line of labels for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it. Home Alone one and two, classic movie. Singles three and four, a good movie if you are three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as trying to be fun, it's not. Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very gentle actor with gentle performances, but it is not his fault, the writing required a gentle vocabulary and gentle expressions. The ropes are just copied from the first two, with different frauds, and you should be blind to think that chicken pox is real. A good choice if you are a pre-school teacher in which this movie is presented on a rainy day. And to make things worse, a completely different distribution, go see if you do not believe me, but you'll regret it.
