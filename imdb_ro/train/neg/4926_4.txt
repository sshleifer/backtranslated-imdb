I've seen this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor people were forced to take a bad film. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariotean, because he explains his contempt for all Christian things, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been . I see this film more like a way for talented Gerard Butler to pay his contributions before being truly recognized, and a way for legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the audience (myself and the other 5 people who have seen this film) that he still exists. I enjoyed the special features on DVD more than the movie itself.
