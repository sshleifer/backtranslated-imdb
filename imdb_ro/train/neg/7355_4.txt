Do not get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love both the series and the movies, but already quite re: Death On The Nile. Everyone did that! We know who dies. We know why I die. We know who the killer is. We know how it was done. So I already say enough! Mr. Suchet could have used this wonderful talent in another of Agatha Christie's novels. I will say that the acting of all the actors was superb. The sets were great and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised at how "terrible," he said. I hope he does not look like this in real life! Frankly, I do not remember other movies if the last one was the same. Somehow I do not believe. I thought it was a wonderful touch if Mrs. Christie wrote it or not. I'd rather have the end to be lost in jail!
