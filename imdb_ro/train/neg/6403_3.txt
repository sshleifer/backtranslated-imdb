.... as to the level of spirit that this comedy operates. Usually, even reaching the length of the length, "I can do it ..." until I need glasses "is a collection of dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe them when you realize that AUA should be punchline (example: Santa's gang), others are so long you can not believe when you realize they need so much time to set up THT punchlines (example: student awards). almost all of them are guided without art. Do not get me wrong: about one in every ten joke manages to be fun (iron / phone is probably my favorite) There is also a wonderful full-blown nudity that once again demonstrates that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also nudity of male comedy). And I agree with others that the song with the intention of silly is actually appealing! But none of these reasons is enough to give this movie something more than * out of 4.
