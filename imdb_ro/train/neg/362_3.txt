In order not to be confused with Madonna's "The Next Best Thing," "The Last Big Thing" is a foolish comedy, outside a wall, about a man who wants to release a magazine called "The Big Big Thing" revises a variety of artists up and coming. This low-budget indie makes Chuck and Buck look like a masterpiece. Aged by weak actors, bad sets and costumes, etc., "... Thing" has earned some terrible reviews and has just been nominated for a marginal award. Get on this.
