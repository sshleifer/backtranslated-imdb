Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Rogers' former friend, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a great team to watch while two reporters are looking for stories about the extravagant hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, wrong identity / development, because Rogers plays a 'double role'. Rogers is charming as usual; but nothing really raises this performance beyond the usual ones - any potential to provide a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is achieved through weak material. The best to watch is Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as the reporters of St. Petersburg. Louis - these are the most important moments of the movie. Songs are good, though badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
