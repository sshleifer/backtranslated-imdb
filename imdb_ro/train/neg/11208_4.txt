Raymond Burr plays the role of a lawyer caught in the assassination of his best friend (Dick Foran) because of his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a whole year before he started making Perry Mason, so the film could be of special interest to his fans, if it were the inspiration for his casting. There is nothing else here that is interesting, though. Lansbury is always good, but her character is a very dimensional one, and the motives of murder are absolutely obvious. There is an interesting interpretation of Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with "fatal females," but the Burr character is quite simple. It is frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr making these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his stop delivery does not match his character here as well as most of the movies I've seen. There is no real mystery, and it is assumed that the whole story of the film and the way Burr's character creates Lansbury's character to engage himself (the double danger prevents him from being tried again for the initial assassination, perhaps). He does it with a very large tape recorder, which he does not notice when he enters the room I suppose. Some fun, unintentional moments, and basically the rest of things could have been done for the TV.
