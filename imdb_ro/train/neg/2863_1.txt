I was glad to watch this movie for free because I work in the hotel industry and this movie has recently come to our film library. Nothing against low-budget films, but this movie has a horrible adventure and direction. How can a movie like this ever be made? The director should be on the black list, and for all the poor players, he is sure he is not a career jumping board. Make sure you will not watch this movie, the act is the blades, the camera and the dire targeting. There are just a few movies that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give them charity, so at least it serves for good reason. <br /> <br /> In that case, I would have followed another 10 (or at least one more time).
