I mark this as a "spoiler" just because of comments from the content of the show, not the content itself. After reading the comments, it is obvious that the Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but despise it, while the Democrats seem to enjoy the so-called veracity. A (right) reader actually indicates that he thinks these events had or could have happened when Bush was in the classroom. But in terms of content as I see it, trying to be neutral, it is that the group that made this series must really be bloody by Bush. In the episode we last saw, s02e03, showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the main runner of the nomination; because the other former runners are all presented. Another thing that attracted my attention was the use of adding to the cabinets. I thought the series must have been made in Europe, certainly not in the United States, because I do not know from home the US that did not build cabinets and most probably in the artists' homes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As I look at the show, yes, I get caught in it, I am amazed to see what a wonderful wish of the writers to do as they can to hurt our president. Of course there are problems that most Americans agree, but this is not a reason to be so ugly in public shows seen all over the world. Perhaps the trend has been set by this show and network, so if Obama or Hillary have entered, would they continue to produce and release the same kind of "humor" about them? comment comments to a commentator. Had there been an election change in 2000, in the opinion of that writer, he was so sure there was a perfectly acceptable president. Wow, the desire for thought on his part. As far as the 911 events are concerned, I think it was set in motion when Clinton was president and I do not see how Gore was president, nothing would be any different.
