This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba parks and has returned to the eye of the world over what's left of the little "Wild West Canada". When Archie began to write her stories for the newspapers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and to convert / absorb the peoples of the first people. The film addresses and questions; why would a well-educated Englishman, talentedly talented to become Indian? Archie, as an English boy who dreams of becoming something, but grasping the complete meaning of that dream is unique and invaluable -. Sounds like a famous doll story, is not it? In my opinion, I saw Archie becoming the living image of the Indian cigarette store, a very wooden character and not really real - very well done by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for a tourist. Plenitude and reality were not realized until he met and married his wife, Annie. Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the English world scene, not himself, but Gray Owl - a native Canadian of the wild frontier. This is the closest Archie gets to become the wild wild prototype. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr Brosnan as well as the directors are well done. I've been watching documentation about Gray Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add my collection. Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake landscape and real "Owl Gray" locations. <br /> <br />
