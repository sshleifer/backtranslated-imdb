It seems to be true to shape, any Dolph Lundgren movie is bad! I do not know if that is the story full of holes, or that Dolph is such a bad actor. It does not have a spoiler here, it seems to go beyond pushing and pushing and grabbing and touching in this movie. In my opinion, it is surprising that some of these projects find venture capital to enter the can and the theater.
