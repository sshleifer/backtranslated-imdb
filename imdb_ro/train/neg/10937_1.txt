Every time a movie will come along, it will be so terrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I live all my life and can save one soul from watching this movie, how great will my joy be. Where to start my discussion of pain. To begin with, a musical installation took place every five minutes. There was no character development. Each character was a stereotype. I swore to the guy, the type of fat that eats donuts, a strange strange guy, and so on. The script felt like it was written while the movie was shot. The value of the production was so low that I felt I was looking at a junior video presentation. You have a director, producers, etc. ever seen a movie? Halestorm worsens and gets worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you be wrong with Gary Coleman and a few legitimate actors. But believe me when I say that, things went wrong, very bad.
