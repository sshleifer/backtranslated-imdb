Unless you're already familiar with pop stars playing this movie, save your time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence. YOU ALWAYS ALWAYS REMOVE THE FILM AND GO POWER WATCH. But if you insist on reading, consider: Vehicle Blades for Japanese teen idols pretty guys featuring nonsensical, convoluted "plot" that pulls for an insufficient amount of time until you're ready to scream. Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, for ANY TIME. Obviously, we can see that something incredible is happening "dramatically," but we just do not give a reason because there is no backstory. Until this movie is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, strident faces of the girlish girls. You will be revolted by the fact that you have spent all the time seeing her smile, crying, weeping, mysterious looks, being "serious" and any useless expression they strike on their faces. go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid garb as the "soul" of any "actor" of it should prove beyond the shadow of a doubt about what the trailer and innumerable comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only the "convert" minions, without mind, will want this movie, most adolescent girls with a pathological adoration for any android. Freud would have a field day. If you are not one of these "mindless" fans, stay away from this abomination.
