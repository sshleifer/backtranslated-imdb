- A newborn couple moves into the husband's husband's wife's home. Not long before the new wife has the feeling that someone does not want her in the house. He sees the skulls around the house. But when the husband investigates, he can not find anything. Does anyone try to take her back to the newly-released asylum? Or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watched The Screaming Skull without the MST3K crew. And it will probably be the last time I look at her like that. Can you say boring? I do not usually talk boring - I'm talking about watching the grass get boring. There are big stretches of the movie where nothing happens. The screen might have been empty and I would have gotten so much fun. Characters rotate continuously with the most imaginable conversations. The Scream Skull could probably be sold as a sleeping aid. The actors do not help too much. Most of them offer sentencing lines normally reserved for a class school. I did not look for it, but I would be shocked to find out that someone associated with this movie has ever appeared in cinematic value. I will not even get into the scenario with which the actors to work with. Let's just say the characters are given with some of the most stupid lines they've ever said about the movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Either avoid this at all costs or at least look for the MST3K version.
