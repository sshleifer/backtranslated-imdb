I'm sick and tired of all these little weenies happening about how this movie "rock". It's a clean CRA over CG! Do not send an assassin, it's much more sensitive to bring hundreds of venomous, colorful, aggressive, poisonous snakes to a plane! The only reason why people prefer this movie because they feel they should. It's not so bad that it's okay. It's so bad I wanted to be in the eye with a sharp stick and then be subjected to it again. I honestly believed it would be a COMFORT as AIRPLANES! A doll! I was wrong. It's that whole shit, take it! " Or Samuel A. Jackson shouts "Snakes on the Plane!" Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand. It seems that a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard If you spend money watching a movie in the company of the same people who bought the William Hung CD, live in their mothers' basements and blow the sweat from the plastic seat of the days on the computer, playing online games and looking at porn, then hurry to the theater and ask for a Snakes ticket on a stupid plane, since I doubt you have a girlfriend. Hell with movies like Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. it's not an irony in watching good movies The true decline of Western civilization, called this cult movie, is an insult to true classics of worship, such as Repo, or even Orgazmo.
