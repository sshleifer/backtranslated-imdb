Any movie that has Karen Allen's nude scenes and I'm still so bored, I left, is a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris and is in love with a sissy-handsome French man with whom she soon gets sex. Of course he is married ("But, why, why should it be a problem?") What might be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) just boring. I left. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie was much better after I left; but it would have had to get much more to cope with a rotten start. My advice, if you find yourself in this, run away, do not walk for the exit. Save time and energy. Sure, save money. It's a shame that the production company has not saved its money.
