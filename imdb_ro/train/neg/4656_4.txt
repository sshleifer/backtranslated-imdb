An outstanding remarkable remembrance of an old, famous English film. Though it can be overly malignant as a total disaster (which is not), it never strengthens tensions and betrays its origin. Richard Burton brings his sleep through his role, and Sophia Loren's closed face (in this film) does not show much passion. (**)
