Anyone who could find a ransom value in this piece of nonsense should examine his head. We have the underwent, heroin-dependent wife, part-time, with wrinkles all over her body, tears received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now she's shaking breast milk on the floor of the kitchen, the release somehow to Helen Keller, putting her hands in running water. We are the husband who starts by patronizing a prostitute who happens to be his daughter (he is angry with him because he came too soon) and ends up killing his colleague, having sex with her body and then cutting her. We have the child who is tirelessly assaulted by his colleagues and who returns home and beats his mother. See, it's still circular. Deep, right? The only decent moment in this awful bunch of sticks is when the father kills his son's torturers. It is a good thing that this turkey was shot on the video because otherwise, what expensive movie loss would be. If the guy who thinks artists should be interested in this crisis is really serious, no wonder that most people think artists are crazy. I saw that horrible movie, then I put on "Zero Woman, The Accused". God, it was a story about who was worse. What is happening in Japan these days? Ill, sick, sick.
