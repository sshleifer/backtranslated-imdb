Mona the vagabond lives on the edge of French society in a lifeless, purposeless, or directional life. I watched this because of all the star reviews, but I'm afraid I must have lost something. Mona's character has little or no personality while floating alive, being rude to people, exalting and contributing to nobody's life. It's not interesting or interesting. It's useless. I have seen and known enough people like this: there is no secret significance of what I do. They're just lazy. I would not want Mona to be close to me, because she tends to steal something that is not blackened and to leave her friends in full swing. Of course it's enigmatic - because there's nothing for her. A lot of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I would not want to see a movie about them. Perhaps there is something I totally lost. Otherwise, I assume that all reviews are from people who assume that anything done by a French female director is a high art.
