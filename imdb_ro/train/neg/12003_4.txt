Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eight spectators in cinemas. Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All the stories have nothing to do with them, but somewhere on Nikhil Advani's lineage they try to show a relationship between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of the 3 hours 15 minutes I found nothing to write. The film is a bad copy of the Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a beautiful movie.
