I have to be completely honest, saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can not give a complete picture of the movie until I see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), intend to make a fortune by taking a transfer of contraceptive pills from the Finisham Maternity Hospital. Matt (Hattie Jacques), along with Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor) work together. The patients and their visitors are also around, including the pregnant Ms. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous father father-of-yourself being Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). He also plays Bill Maynard as Freddy and Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. This plan, by the way, does not work because all staff are in the way. That's all about the movie until I see it again. Good!
