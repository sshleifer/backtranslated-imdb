Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep her unseen and beautiful wife. For this purpose, he makes drugs during wedding ceremonies to make them seem dead so they can steal their bodies. I'm not sure what to do with the corpses. I do not remember how it was fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects him into his wife. (I guess you just guess it's spinal fluid Spinal fluid was all the rage of crazy scientists in the 1940s.) You can guess enough of the rest here. I am a couple (well, much more than a couple, but I will only write about two) of the problems I have with this movie. One is how Bela is used. Sure, he does a pretty decent job in his own way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abisal). But hiding behind a monk or putting him in the female reporter's bedroom doing nothing is stupid. Also, why did they beat and / or killed every boy he has? Is it to make him look bad? Well, someone who kidnaps comatose brides does not need to be made to look worse. The second problem I have is the idea of ​​making drug brides. Why brides? Would not any woman under the age of 20 do? Watching Bela go through these giraffes to get her victims, I was reminded of the idiot fisherman of Stil still knowing what you did last summer. In each case, it would seem that there is an easier way to achieve your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that greatly depends on the circumstances that do not affect you. (BTW, an alternative title for this movie is "The Case of Missing Couples." I think it partially explains the need for "brides.")
