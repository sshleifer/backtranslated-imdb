I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The banks would not have worked for Gilligan Island. If the evening had taken place, there would have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eve have had to replace the furnace, except that Adolf suggested that the genre had 50 seats? Another post compared to this show I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was badly done and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage caused by the Nazis in England and the number of people they killed, I think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repulsive, and the most normal people would have killed this concept before anything episodes were produced.
