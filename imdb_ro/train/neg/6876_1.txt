Yes, this was a wonderful, absolutely incredible condescending. We know that the French often have a clear idea of ​​the US, it is puritanism and opinions about sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunities to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT an element of the middle city presented in this movie sounded real. A man who has never sex because he was told in high school 20 years before the penis is too big? Where in the world do you find this? A box of juke in a bar that only plays vintage blue? A city of about 16 people in less than two hours away from Chicago, but without a major gas station, no televisions in the house, no McDonalds, no children ... A population that knows each other's intimate details is still uniting as a great family who hate each other. Adult men plan pillows at the local café, farm, but do not harvest, kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and seem to escape with her and with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will take the virgin boy 17 years old because of his sexual generosity, the man too much meat that goes from descending to the maize fields by simply blowing a breeze from Illinois to help divert the same 17-year-old farm boy years? HELP! I am so confused and amazed by the absurdity of this film that I do not express how ridiculous it is. Go to see it for the A-to-Z primer to avoid. God, I hope I did not ruin it for you!
