Foolish show of predictability about a man who murdered his wife, grabbing her during the leadership and claiming to have lost her. Why was he driving another car? Why was he still able to drive a car that killed his wife with one? This question did not happen to the writers. The story then goes about a psychologist and about the marriage that is falling, linked to the bankrupt marriage of the driver who kills his wife. An omnipresent mother and a dimensional child are thrown to a good degree, and the whole is built to a predictable end and division. Are police psychologists so easy to take? The fact that the actors do their best, but they are doomed to failure. This is on par with a Harlequin novel. Do not waste your time by watching it unless you are looking for it.
