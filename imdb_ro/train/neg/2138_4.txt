War, Inc. - Corporations will take over the war in the future and use only one assassin Brand Hauser (John Cusack) to do their wet work against CEOs. A dark comedy, satirizing both the army and corporations. Often, it was difficult to understand exactly what was going on. I waited for things to make sense. There is no reason or method for madness. Cusack is believed to be Grosse Point Blank's "spiritual successor". For example, War is more or less a blow. Again, we see Cusack as an assassin that protects the * spoiler * of the person he should kill while dealing with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack seems quite credible, carrying half a dozen people easily. Short fights look good. The rest of the movie does not. It's all weird often bizarre. War Inc. is not fun enough to be a parody and too hard for anyone to think about the film's message, which may be the ways of the heart that corporations, such as war factions, compete and change without a decrease of the consideration given to how the ordinary citizens affect. Interesting, but satire does not work, because it's not funny, and at its heart the movie has no heart. We should fight how war affects Cusack's shell of a character, rather than millions of lives destroyed by war. John Cusack offers decent performance. His character finds hot-shoe shots and drives the smallest private airplane, but strangers are meant to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei defeats herself as a romantic journalist. There really is not a great deal of chemistry between them. Hilary Duff is trying a Russian accent and is not stupid about it. Joan Cusack cried and cried singers. Blech. Ben Kingsley might have to return Oscar if he does not start making a decent performance again. Pathetic. It's not a terrible movie, but in the end you have to ask "War, why is it good?" Nothing at all. C-
