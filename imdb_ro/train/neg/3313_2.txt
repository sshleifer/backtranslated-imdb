How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy? If I had not left, then I would be asleep and ask for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like he was on a wrong set. I like the most chicken, but I hated it. This is the only time I've seen so spit and not started. The equipment was far too troublesome. Nobody talks like that anymore, and I do not think they did it right then. The dance part was horrible. My ex told me later ... "Did not you like that part? Did not you think it was sensible?" I said yes just to spare my feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
