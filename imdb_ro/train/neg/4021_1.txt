This is probably the worst movie ever made, it's just bad, Roger Corman's name being associated with it. I could have understood this in my early years when it had smaller budgets, but there is currently no excuse to give birth to that! I'm a "B" movie perverse and from some people's point of view, all the movies they love are left out by "ordinary viewers," but I'm talking about it, the Vampire Club is topping my list of the most good of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires without columns, the musical score is completely out, the sound effects are not effective and eventually Mr.Savage does not seem to know he's in a vampire movie at all the witches I'm too bad for having a "not too bad" career everywhere. Let me know that I'm trying because of this when I do not like a movie that I tend to forget about the good side.
