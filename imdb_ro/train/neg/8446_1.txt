Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should have laughed? There is no clue or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are pestilent, especially those who think it is Aldo of Sicily, who can not make a Sicilian accent! Let's not talk about the dreamlike introduction of Dracula ... another sender, fired from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "movie" take a bit longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do all they can, but this so-called movie was really too hard to save. I would have given it "0" / 10, but the smallest mark was 1/10 and I had to overestimate it with a mark.
