I can not say anything wrong or good about this. Its characters are pretty nice, are capable of being produced and designed, and professional (except that chest monster costume). However, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing you have seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, a cookie cutter, "dirty body scandals in deep space to a monster unstoppable." Quite a waste of time.
