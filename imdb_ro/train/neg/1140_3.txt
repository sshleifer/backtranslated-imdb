Scary, but especially in the sense that it will end before the age of 70. I saw this as a late night re-run around 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like biscuits, it's better than nothing (but only). Ray Milland is a little frightening because it seems to be stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks like he was smoking all Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is a turkey that should never have been done. If you have insomnia and it is 1:30 am on Saturday morning and it's nothing but replicas of the 1972 Roller Derby Champship, then I suspect it will defeat it. But God can help if this is your only choice for entertainment.
