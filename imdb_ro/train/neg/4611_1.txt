I think Jack's great empathetic capacity makes him the powerful performer he represents, but empathy comes at a price like everything - when surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with him. It's a joke like a mafiot-hit man (also because the part does not fit him a bit, he is so extrovert) and just grazing avoids making a madman himself in this. Kathleen Turner had a too long career too long being just the tall and blonde because her acting ability is limited to what she does with her eyes when she opens her wide that she is convinced she's so sexy Anjelica Huston is absolutely the same, like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is a blade sketch (and this will be the only mention of the helm that they call a screenplay) of a gangster film, with a cast that probably was only interested in getting to party after the party quickly (surely the party elite gathered in this regard). What, they shot him someday? - because it would be the only explanation.
