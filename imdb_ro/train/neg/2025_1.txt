My wife and I are half amused by Howie Mandel's show. I like Shatner - even when he's the most pathetic. But this is absolutely the worst show on TV. <br /> <br /> Cancel this show. It sucks a **. The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are stronger on this show and they seem to wear less clothes than the Deal or no offer ... Questions are a mixture too easy and incredible way obscure. And watching Shatner or the competitor say "Show me the money" makes me want to vomit. It will not take long.
