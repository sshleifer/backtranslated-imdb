The original Japanese film "Gamera" of 1965, http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/, was essentially an update of the Gojira (Godzilla) sensitivities aimed at fewer and fewer children. Gamera, of course, is a giant flying torch that consumes literally energy - not as large as some versions of Godzilla but generally similar in most ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and recruited by the notoriety of Sandy Frank. And just like Godzilla's King of the Monsters, "Gammer Invincible" becomes more than misspelling. American scenes are not as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but they do not add too much to the story, either because there is not much attention to them. <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising, there are some scenarios worth developing the character, and there are plenty of personalities to create a certain tension outside the main ground. Once the film Gamera appears, the film begins to descend into a pretty good film of kaiju. The action is good enough - even American add-ons are fine. Directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad for their time (all the thumbnails). Some sets and backgrounds are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is not much to the original about this movie. Gamera, however, develops a more unique personality in later films - most of them are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.
