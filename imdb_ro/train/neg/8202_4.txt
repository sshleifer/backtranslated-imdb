It's a remake of Thing (1982/1951), I think it is, there are so many factors from previous movies that give it all. <br /> <br /> So, action is bad, James Spader makes an overwhelming renewal of his own stargate with his coffee cup and his strange thoughts or movements, but about that, the other actors he did not even think of, I saw. You do not have the feeling of knowing some of the main characters. And the evolution of the plot is slow, boring, and I know what's going to happen in 30 minutes. The score / music is ultraboring, imean there are a lot of people ubertallented out there who would score for a coke and a credit, but this is the major carp. Some of the special effects are nice if they were made in the early '90s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, it's not what this movie is. a boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak, and Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay's production really went really bad. Now this combination would be great if somone knew what they were doing and the only ones who knew there was nobody. Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are in a cold night and you just want to look at something, the time will pass slowly.
