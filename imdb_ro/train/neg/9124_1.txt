Perhaps it's not the worst movie Peter Sellers ever did (I think that laurel goes to Zenda's Prisoner), but it's certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially the makeup look as Nayland Smith, show he has just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, he does not look much better and spends most of the movie (except those strange scenes that destroy his electric currents) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of this makeup. The supporting players also look tired and run down, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A bright spot: this would be one of the last times, an important cinematographic image would look so insulting Asians ... or, moreover, a non-Asian star like one!). The movie looks surprisingly inexpensive, with snapshots and smooth sets - even the number of blows from Elvis at the end of the year shows a reduction in pace. Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous type who make their wet pants add any spark of life to this sad affection. Overall, this film offers an adventurous premonition for the death of a great comic and a documentary of his death.
