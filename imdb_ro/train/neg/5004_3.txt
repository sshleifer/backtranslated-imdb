Wow is ironic because this movie has been off for a while I think somebody else JUST reviewed it a few days ago. Anyway, I watched this movie, simply because Nick Stahl is there for recording. The movie was ridiculous. Characters led me INSANE, they were SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. She had too many twists and turns too. There is a scene in the movie that is worth seeing, however, the scene: "Hot Heart, Cold Gun", where Nick Stahl kills the tiring girl in the shower. (Well, in fact, they were all unpleasant.) But the action in the scene was great. Looking at the face, I remembered the American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing, but it is not worth watching the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and do not watch it.
