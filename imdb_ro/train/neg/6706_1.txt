I saw this move a few years ago at the Florida Central Film Festival, if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most people here made this film because the movie seemed impressed (by own admission of the film on the official site - the short was exposed as "cut-cut"). However, it was a comedy that unfolds easily. I think many people are trying to read too much in a comedy. All you have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I just did this at the presentation, so she did it at that level. Just my 2 cents.
