At first glance, this gives the impression that it will be a ridiculous blaxploitative move and contains moments in which it is heading in this direction. However, the idea of ​​a basic story is far more powerful than one could expect, and it is a respectable effort to describe the racial problems in the Second Age War era. The recognized cast is hit and missed, and Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams, who fail to do the best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops only to twist his empty mustache in a tumultuous struggle. The obviously low budget leads to inconsistencies in production values. The locations are great, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if "Ryan's private salvation" consisted in the fact that half of the platoon was killed just like Caparzo from Vin Diesel (unless the effects can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. However, the outcome, the heroic soldiers who do not receive any respect for their realization because they are black and Boyd's racist captain is affected by this, is convincing, just like the sequences of Turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits, the soldiers were left to fight instead of digging latrines. In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" does not succeed at all. But it is a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be remodeled as a very good film and, as it happens, is an exciting effort.
