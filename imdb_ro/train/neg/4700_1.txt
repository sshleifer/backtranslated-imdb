I totally forgot the movie. He was so retarded. They have to do some acting lessons ... no, wait, that will not help because people in the Naked Brothers Band are late. Do you know why I'm here, even if I'm a Naked Brothers band bear? To warn people before they watch the bad movie that NBB does not receive money from it, then they can not make silly amateur songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write in 10 seconds. Not only that the lyrics of the song are delayed but play bad. Okay, I've got the movie around here ... anyway, it was boring and they acted terribly. It was not at all funny, even if they tried very hard to be. I think it deserves a credit for that ... well, the movie does not deserve your time. Look at his assessment. The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone with half the brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you have to look at movies in which the actors act, without stuttering the lines in a monotonous way. I'm at the theater club in my school and some people are actually better than those guys Nat and Alex. Hurry before it's too late! I thought seriously that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I do not even know why I went through that movie. I do not think it really deserves to be called a movie ...
