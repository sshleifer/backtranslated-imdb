Quite the most boring crap I have seen for a long time. The intrigue was full of irrelevancy, and the act was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, the camera angles that made me feel bad were used, the incidental music was terrible and drowned the dialogue (maybe it's not a bad thing then), and the photos from San Francisco seemed to have been stolen directly from the promotional video of the city's board of directors. <br /> <br /> Oh, and mandatory sex scene was not even well done. Better enlightenment next time, please.
