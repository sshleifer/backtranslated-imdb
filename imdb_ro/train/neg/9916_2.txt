The Justin-loving idealist is pushed into the world of occultism, killing, drinking under age, and other generous things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, I saw the same movie that almost every other commentator here saw ??? Intelligent, convincing, original, intentional, intelligent, genius ???? !! I have not witnessed any of these things. What I saw was a low-budget, uninteresting, gentle, tribal, highly clich√© thriller who was a teammate with implausibility and no tension in the slightest way because the killer is telegraphed as soon as possible in the movie on what the monologue / debate / discussion gives. And where are these moments full of humor? I never tortured myself, maybe because I was too busy fighting for not to sleep with the movie. <br /> <br /> My degree: D Extras DVD: Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; The second commentary with different contributors, as well as isolated musical pieces; 4 featurettes (Making, Set, Turning a Camera in 4, and Inside the Black Circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; bloopers; a video for "Addiction"; A trailer for this movie; And the trailers for Shock-o-Ram, Chainsaw Sally, Skin Crawl, Sinful, Bacterium, Creature from the Lagoon Hillbilly,
