Defeated by the terrible lie on the cover, "American Pie Fun", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and certainly not one. You will never laugh unless you are one of Jackass's minds. It's not even an erotic movie that would be at least something, since it's about sex ... So, what is that? The irregular plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember "losing him" for one) and the group of friends. The rest of the characters (that is, the girls) do not come and go for a credible reason. Come on, they're even dwarfs (so simple: "dwarves are fun ho ho" ...) The actor is very TV (as well as watching the film alongside the movie) and certainly amateur for most girls. <br /> <br /> The film is terrible. Amateur, stupid products, and everywhere not FUNNY. Children and adolescents will enjoy watching with friends because of oaths and sex. Besides, you do not even think about renting this movie.
