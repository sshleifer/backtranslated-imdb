I should never have looked at this movie. The shooting style can be considered artistic for some, but it is thought to have caused me migraines. I think he might have an interesting plot, but since I could not look at him for long periods of time, I lost a lot. The shivering images and stopping the motion moves my brain. I stopped looking halfway and did not return for the second try. I assume that if I were alone in my own without a dark and stormy evening, it could just be the ticket ... PS I'm not sure if light / film style can be considered a spoiler, but I do not want to be the blacklist in my first review;)
