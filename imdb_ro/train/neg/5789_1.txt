My wife and I had great hopes for this film, but it was a great disappointment. It was a native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who does not succeed in everything he tries, eg. fishing, hunting, obviously he subordinates his family to wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but during the trial he is at his son several times in various obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. Children and wife are very real, making the movie even sadder. I have no humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people who are bad about themselves. I do not understand how prizes could have been won. Save your money, it's not worth renting.
