This was one of the most bored "horror" movies I've ever seen. A college child has an epidemic of nightmares involving alcoholic beverages in Alcatraz. Attempting to offer a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire fare in the form of a bad music video from the 80's, the movie is full of bad action and an exhaustive moving story. Although, being such a bad and often ridiculous movie, it would be a good piece of material to praise you for an episode of the Mystery 3000 Science Theater. Do not be fooled by the pride of mentioning the film, winning the Silver Scroll Award in 1987 by the Academy Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil takes part in the film. It's a gigantic disaster, though one with a small worship next (see other IMDb comments for this movie).
