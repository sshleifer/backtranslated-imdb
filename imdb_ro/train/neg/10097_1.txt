I stopped by BB and I took four zombie blows to look over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be stuff, the act will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not wait too long. But it should have at least one story. Stories cost nothing, except for time ..... apparently, they did not have time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie, all of which looked like new prostitutes. The image of the zombie on the front cover never appears in the movie. He was absolutely agonizing to look at and had nothing to offer the genre. The operating time is only 81 minutes, but it was 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie from the computer in another room), sounds like zombie porn ... which, if you think about it, sounds pretty thick ..... but it did not it was even so good. The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up in an incoherent mess. free rental and I feel still broke off. I rated it at 1 in 10 because IMDb will not allow me to use decimals.
