You thought the first landing on the Moon would be pretty dramatic without having to do anything about it. However, this documentary seems to have to throw everything in the ugliest possible light. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module, and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the coach and the spacecraft were dealing with each other. This makes the computer overload problem (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence be a near catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew. And it takes the "thirty seconds" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before leaving, when it's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory. If you want to watch a documentary or a dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From Earth to Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip it.
