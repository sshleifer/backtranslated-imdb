With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season 1. I can not imagine what I think. As a fan of horror, he can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless chaos, but this series gets worse with each exit. I can not imagine how disgusting it is for the actors and the crew to go every day to work, trying to get that nonsense out. STORY! Is it too much to ask for? CHARACTER! How can we fool about Everyone's fate in these stories? If we are not employed, who cares whether they are carved or not? Almost every episode ends with bloodless minds, leaving for a thick shock, without any sense of revelation or conclusion, OR SUMMING why we have been subjected to an hour of blood. Even Dante's effort this season has had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered into an unnecessary conclusion. Ironically, production values ​​and performance tend to be at a speed, while the content is completely poor. I have high hopes for VALARIE from Garric's producer under the beds, but we'll see.
