Now I've just been curious about it and I had to look - in the same way that you're going to watch a car accident ... I appreciate it as a spoof, but it must not stop from criticism of direction, acting and terrible dialogue. Seriously, this movie was considered one of the safest movies I've ever seen - it's more like an episode of stories from Cryptkeeper and a poor one on it ... Okay - a few critics (1) when the doctor had a heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monsters attacking him, so we assume a heart attack), the army then launched shells, rockets, bullets to the monster - which were legs from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any rocket and still alive (2) the army attack at about 100 meters away and we see that a flame thrower is used - geez, these things have a radius of maximum 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the teacher, the soldiers enter the classroom and light up in the ceiling; the monster painting the baby, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) the monster looks like something in the Power Rangers! (5) there is a scene in which the five "good boys" (priest, little girl, doctor, reporter and child) show with shocks and we get reactions (from hand to hand) one after another - so natural! (6) the general just flees, from time to time (7) the general refuses to try the electricity and would not listen (8) the act is terrible (9) I mentioned the monster rubber suit ???? (10) that goddamn music, non-stop!
