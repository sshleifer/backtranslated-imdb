I did not really know what this movie was like when I went to the theater to see it (hype about satanism, etc.) because the trailers in the last movie I saw seemed quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Honey, Roman Catholic mythology? It's not my idea to frighten and honestly, I felt I was looking at a very good, scary movie, not a real religious joke, trying to record cheap emotions, having some bloody birds every few minutes! /> I will try to keep myself away from spoilers (!) But it seemed strange to me that an atheist who receives a rosary bead from a deceased priest could eventually get to the wounds of Christ are not supposed stigmas to be profoundly religious?) That is, she rests with losers, confronts misleading things, behaves like a typical rebel, and elsewhere, and here she shows the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come on! Her scenes crucified, her head thrown back, shouting, blood all over, became quite tedious after seeing her a dozen times. It was neither frightening nor scary, simply repulsive. However, it was quite painful to look - those scenes that were moving were extremely annoying ... CONCLUSION: If you are a Catholic, you do not see it. If you are not, you still do not see it.
