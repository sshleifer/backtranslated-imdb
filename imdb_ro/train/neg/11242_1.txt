I saw this movie last month at a free preview and I went out. It was pretty horrible. In the process of trying too hard, they acted and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed when I felt that all the actors had made respectable choices in the past, so this could not be so far from the mark - but I was wrong. We hoped they would make a poll at the end of the movie, so I could tell them not to release this movie. I was attracted to the free preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I'm usually very amused. He tried to be innovative and creative with fires, ideas and filming, but because they had thrown together so many ideas at once, it failed. I usually do not care about movies and usually do not feel the need to show my views on movies, but I had to warn everyone not to look at it. I signed up on IMDb just to tell you all
