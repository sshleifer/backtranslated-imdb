After seeing "The Triumph of Will", I can say that this film is frightening, even measured against the low historical "standards" of time. Of course, they are all manufactured and injurious. This is expected from the 1930s German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is stingy and inexpensive. It's also so ridiculously ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must have left the theater with their nose. In a genre renowned for its basic appeal, the lack of originality and non-apologetic mistake, this film does not even qualify as "bad". You should improve significantly to get this status!
