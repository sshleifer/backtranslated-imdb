I was looking forward to watching this movie, and then I realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between actors was stabbed by unnecessary swearing. Now I'm not at all cautious, but shouting obscenities to each other does not make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is probably one of the worst actors in the world at this time (confesses his performance to the awful god Life of Stuff) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. As many of these Kiss Kiss Bang Bang movies as "beautiful creatures" have to suffer before movie makers realize that the word "f", the word "c", etc. does not replace the proper dialogue.
