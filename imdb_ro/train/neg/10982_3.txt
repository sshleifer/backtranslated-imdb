The film had good and good moments (although obviously a fairly low budget), but inappropriate assessment due to underlying prerequisites being underdeveloped. The main point of conflict between the two leaderships does not take place in a realistic way at all. There are a few scenes I disagree about, but there are no depth discussions explaining how I can be together while seeing the world so different, especially since Glenn's employment is so wound up in this part of his life (and Adam is quite active with him that he supports him with time and money.) Also several times Glenn is negatively portrayed to be how he is (Adam's apology for his past), while Adam proves to be upstanding and "traditional," which the film proclaims to be the "good" way in the end. I do not like being preached like this. I participated in a discussion session with the director after I watched the LTR and he said he had presented this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn's shoes (and said he does in real life, it refers to the point of view of Glenn's) with Adam's views. Well, then, I think he should have done a better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the movie. The director also said that he directed this film, his first film, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but away from a top effort. I've seen it worse, but I rarely let the movies feel this frustrated.
