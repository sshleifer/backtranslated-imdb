This movie is a dirty and forgetful vehicle Sean Connery. Performances are generally scary especially by Capshaw, Fishburne, and usually by the solid Ed Harris. Connery seems like a Harvard Academic. The movie gets worse as it moves on. It is a third rhythm mystery that becomes extremely controversial when it is unleashed. The movie scatters an excellent distribution. George Plimpton also finds himself in a minor role of adding Connery's gravity while discussing the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere throw a mystery / thriller of the third rate that is the highest degree of manipulation. The scenario and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and screen presence are the only virtue of the film. Manipulators, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
