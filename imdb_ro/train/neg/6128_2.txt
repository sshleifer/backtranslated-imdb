This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not rely on a whole movie! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotyped, there's no real story, but short episodes with strange characters that are not strange enough to make the real plot. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most of the actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery of why they took their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was meant to be authentic or unique. It could have been a lot harder than that ... 2 of 10
