My wife and I thought this movie was a Manhattan Murter Mystery television version (BBC) ... which is in itself good but not great. The story has a low inter-character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character wanders around, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson do not have much to do. It's quite disappointing, I have to say. Ian McShane's role is just an extended aspect of the cameo. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I wonder how much did BBC have to pay to Woody Allen to get rid of Manhattan?" He probably needed the money and needed his call to expand his audience beyond the youth market towards the two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3, because it is the unspoken background noise. If you ever want to have something while knitting or sorting the collection of stamps, it will do the job. I would not pay to rent it again.
