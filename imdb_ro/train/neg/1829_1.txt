Dumbass! Dumbass! Dumbass! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore. How to let people make movies is beyond me. I can not understand how this happens if I perform at work the way I behave in a movie I would have fired and that society owns ..... I should kindle myself. GOD! This film was just a simple, steaming and full of POO, which must be vaporized if possible. Otherwise I have to say that the orientation of 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why websites will require a short written novel, when sometimes a short commentary is all that is needed.
