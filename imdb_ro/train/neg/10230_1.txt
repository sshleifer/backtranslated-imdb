It happened after a copy of this. Not mine, and if I had spent my money on this, I would find those responsible and ask her back! All I can say is that it would be a terrific student movie. Any understanding of the film environment is absent. The actor is terrible, the story would have been dismissed from the original Twilight Zone as non-original and blade, and changing the tone of the main character's reaction to the "ghost" is ridiculous. I only agree that the "brilliant" reviews of this movie are from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even bad fun. <br /> <br /> Amateurs in Extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
