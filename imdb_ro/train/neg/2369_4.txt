The sixth escape for Freddy Krueger, in which he finally managed to kill almost every young man in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do this. A failure as a horror film, because it's just not scary at all. It works better like a dark and macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger was uncomfortable with the soggy pitch as he could not finish the ball. (Too many witches, that's for sure.) Actors are not interested (except for Robert Englund, as always, and an obvious Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply too many visual effects. The end is OK, but it does not offer as many sparks, as I think it might be. In adding a new twist to the story of the familiar dreamer's killer, he gives Englund the opportunity to make more non-make-up scenes from the past. <br /> <br /> There are camouflages worth mentioning: a common cameo by the couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold, which is worthless entertainment, an appropriate appearance by Alice Cooper's veteran shock-rocker and funny Johnny Depp's cameo that , also recognizes the pop icon that he has become. Film debut by Breckin Meyer, playing Spencer. One of the best things to do is to resume key scenes from previous entries during the closing credits. 4/10
