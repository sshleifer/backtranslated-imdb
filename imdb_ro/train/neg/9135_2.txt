Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnum example, a brilliant example for us that deserves to be nominated in the Academy of the Arts and Cinematography Sciences (as you mentioned on your 1998 website). Unfortunately, it is better to remain silent and be ready for a fool than to talk and eliminate any doubt. With Ben & Arthur, you're doing this. Apparently assembled with a lack of instruction or education, the script of the film guides us to the real bizarre with every new scene. It's this crazy apology of a story that could also be the best ally of the movie. Beginning with warmth, homosexual characters Ben and Arthur try to get married, going so far as to fly across the country to do so in the shadow of the finest palm trees in Vermont. But all these posts are just a lead for BLOOD. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, there must be at least 20 dollars in fake makeup in the last third of this movie. The film as a whole is a technical blunder. From sound to music editing, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard, it's a wonder the movie even keeps on any support you see. It is a shame that amateur amateur shows are scattered here. It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you made five figures on this movie in rentals or whatever would lead poor souls (like me) to see this movie. Unfortunately, we do not laugh with you.
