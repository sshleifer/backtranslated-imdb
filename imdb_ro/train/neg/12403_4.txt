ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9) movie of the series and shows the direction in which it is inevitably going. The characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) will be in front and in the center. The rest of the distribution was too going just fist clock and collect their checks. The series will rise to this occasion again and will have its moments, but a fatal fall would be put in. Lewis Stone throughout the series would still portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic way. The rest of the distribution would be professional, even if it had given less and less to do. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, would continue his character as if there had not been a learning curve. Andy's reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way. Even after returning as World War II veteran to Andy Hardy (1946), his reaction to any "teapot storm" was the same, juvenile. In this film is clearly illustrated. ANDY wakes up in some unbelievable situations that, with a simple explanation, would have been resolved. This screen writer was known as "idiotic plotting." A means to stretch a badly written script. Maybe it was Mickey Rooneys's less guilty than the director and the writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz directed too much and needed a firmer hand to control Rooneys' excesses.
