Oh, man, how fast the series went down until 1952! This boring is just the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only the heroes get rid of traps adding scenes that were not there in the previous chapter (and that there might be there - tell me that when evil blows up the plain in episode 7-8 they will not see jump characters) but I think this series has the world record of images. I mean, most of it is a movie! And not just from other series (apparently all flight sequences come from the Rocket King, and the terrible scenes of "melted rocks" in Episode 2 to 3 come from Captain Marvel's Adventures), but of course! The whole sequence of "Moon Journey" (which is probably the shortest, has 30 seconds, and the characters do not seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) in Episode 1 is repeated in Episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Have I ever wondered why MST3K never made episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9, so they did not have to do it all again!). began with the science factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon ever! And people of the moon who can not breathe in their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough, it's too talky and the waterfalls (usually the best thing in the series) are few and far. Visually, am I the only one who thinks Commando Cody's bullet-shaped bullet helmet (or lemon-shaped) is totally ridiculous? Rocketeer's was much colder, no matter how bad the movie was (and the man was terrible). The tank vehicle is not much better, apparently a bunch of kids did it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor playing the hero is homely instead of the usual muse (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!) But then it is so untouched ... <br /> <br /> It's not even worth looking for the sake of nostalgia. See Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, check the Rememberable Quotes section for a real woman).
