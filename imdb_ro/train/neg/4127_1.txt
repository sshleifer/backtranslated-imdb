A movie so bad as this one should be withdrawn from all the stores around the world. So, full of dull, dull, unimaginable characters, and a leading character with such annoying attitude and a dry voice that always gives a thoughtless voice to every action and feeling, this film holds the record of the most challenging film on which I've ever seen. As I paid money to hold them, I felt a duty to see it and how I regret it. My head hurt all along, because of the awesome characters of their dull and useless, plot less lives. A bunch of kids who have zero knowledge of nothing, are all cold and worst of all, have a terrible dialogue all over them, just mulling around as the main character tries to have a face-to-face meeting. Tedious, so much so that my friend was shaking with hatred and I was red, shameful, that I threw 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I did not make my money back. Avoid the plague.
