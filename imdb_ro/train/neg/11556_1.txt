Oh, those Italians! Assuming movies about aristocrats with strange fetishes, the castles drowned in the Gothic atmosphere and the relatives in the back who are trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've actually seen it all (MST3K's favorite "Screaming Skull" fits the mold) ... and "The Night Evelyn came out of the tomb" is the formula -de numbers, and boring as a hell. Even the energetic Erika Blanc is here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
