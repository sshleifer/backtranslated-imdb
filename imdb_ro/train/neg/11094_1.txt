This is another movie on my list of movies that I should not bother you. She saw her 40 years ago as a teenager, she was too late to do this, she was very upset to find that it was about 95% romance, 4% anything else, 1% history if that. It's what I call a bait and switch a movie, one with an interesting title, the real movie is a scam. This is a subject that deserves good cinematic treatment, this film is almost an insult to those who have served. The current members of the Lafayette Squadron were not running away from the law, nor were they made by abusive houses, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them came from a higher class background than the Tab Hunter character. The flying school is not for those who deal with intelligence, and they know that everything, such as the one presented here, would not have lasted for two days, either wardrobe or infantry. Discipline in the French army was often quite fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
