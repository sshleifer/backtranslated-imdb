A warship sinks ... its survivors hanging on a nearby rescue cork, sit there doing nothing while going in each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Even though Noel Coward's name is only one that you notice during credits, all that is cinematic is because of Lean. And from a technical point of view, very good. David Lean just KNEW movies from the beginning. There are several moments in which the Coward study has a second chair and the visual sense Lean is the focus of attention. Try the soldiers to descend from the ship to the end and the whole scene; the pursuit shot to the singing hymn, the scene in which we are in a house that gets bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the most serious actors I've ever seen. It is completely wooden, without displaying emotion, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what another artist says, he expects to finish, so he can rush his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Her episodic, a bit repetitive, and flashbacks overwhelm the story: there is no central story that they advance, they only give general outlook to the characters. Still, it's an exciting movie that deserves a watch - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very profound or penetrating film, and certainly a propaganda film, but also a presentation of Lean's editing skills - all about how the pieces are put together.
