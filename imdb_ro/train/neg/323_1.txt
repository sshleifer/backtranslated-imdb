This movie was so bad I could not stay by it without doing anything else. There was no plot or no point. I was very bored about a comedian movie on my feet, I could not remember a joke or a funny description line. Politicians who do not have charism speaking technical jargon can not be less fun. So how did this work? Is there no quality control in the movie? Watching bikini girls was the only distraction during this horrible experience. It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in fine comedies, managed to survive this type of exposure. It has never been fun in this movie, so it proves that writing is so vital in effective comedy.
