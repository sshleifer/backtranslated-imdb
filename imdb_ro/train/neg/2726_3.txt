Given the pedigree, it should be a much more enjoyable film than it is. Even with a collection of eccentrics in the cast - what the actor would not eagerly anticipate a film that brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the whole event is rhythmical, usually shot and, most of the time, mindless. Kim Novak's bodies were not essentially comic, as confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as demonstrated in The Philadelphia Story at Harvey. I think it's better off this mess than anybody else. Except maybe the cat.
