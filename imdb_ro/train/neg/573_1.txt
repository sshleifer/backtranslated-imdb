The last reviewer was very generous. I'm reassuring the first movie, but I can not say I'm very happy about it. The beginning is supportive, but it goes pretty fast down. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a bad vampire hunter and the princess vampire is neither sexy nor frightening. Many scenes make no sense. I mean, any ordinary person would suspect that something happens when a strange woman suddenly appears from nowhere to seduce you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing has ever been explained in this movie, you would not mind if it was fun, but that was too much to ask. It has to be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
