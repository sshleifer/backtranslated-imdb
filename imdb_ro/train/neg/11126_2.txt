Of all the movies I've seen, this movie is almost at the bottom (the Haunted Mansion, nothing but Trouble, and a few others hinder it from reaching the bottom of the rock). It is rushed, the story is blurred and the events described are bad. Of course we have to put something on it at the writer's door. The book on which the film was shot after it is scandalously weighted and illogical. Oprah offers a pleasant appearance as Bigger's mother, but she is not close to her potential. Other famous artists also seem to be at worst. The land that focuses around an African American who has decided to take a job as a driver. In the leadership of the family daughter at a communist dinner, he gets acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against the blacks, but he thinks they are. So when she comes home she puts her to bed, but it starts to happen. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to calm her, but instead chokes her. Now, afraid she really has problems in killing a white girl, he does what every logical thought would do - throws it into the coal furnace. So the investigators carry out a missing person case and they check the furnace (the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of ash.) He is then arrested in the last hour, or so are the unpleasant segments of the courtroom desperate for a bad movie. something could do the job, but if you really want to learn about cultural issues in the 1940s and 50s or see a good drama, there are much better options.
