really horrible ... the actor did OK ... the movie, the plot, etc., was totally bad and inaccurate maybe it was a good continuation ... anything had little or no relevance for Carlitos Way ... and it would must be avoided like plague by any kind of Carlito fans ... no reference to Gail comes to another bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how it was caught, no mention of how has come to prison. .. they tried to make the original with the flash back at the beginning ... but to be honest when we evaluated them we were looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to miss it more ... <br /> < It's a terrible attempt to make money in what was one of the best movies in the 90's ... it was generally about 6 pounds and 2 hours of my wasted life ... for all the " action "in it, was really boring slow and predictable ... again, for any of Carltio Way's fans avoids this fiasco ...
