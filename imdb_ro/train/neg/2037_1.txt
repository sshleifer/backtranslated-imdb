If I could give him a zero, I would change my mind and give it -10 in return. The absolutely horrible, filmless movie does not make sense of what's going on. Just PLAIN BORING. Please do not lose your money in this way. Pleaseee !!! This movie could have done so well if it described the true story of the zodiac killer, but in the night, I felt nothing but disgust while watching him. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, it's better to look at a movie you've seen three or four times before watching these crap! I do not understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know they will not do well. Zombie killer should be called "Boric killer" in place!
