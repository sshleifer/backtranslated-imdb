I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones has begun to make some of the most incredibly dull cartoons I've ever seen. I have not laughed once during this short and it's a cartoon Bugs Bunny for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short one turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another short, incredibly boring Jones) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. The first warning of a cartoon is not always a payment. Good night Elmer was boring because he dragged the same two gags forever with predictable gains. This cartoon, on the other hand, is affected by the second warning of a cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The drawing at least has more than two gags on the sleeve, but most of them appear to be longer than they are due to the immense filling of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finished eating dinner and commented: "That was very good somewhat good wamb," perhaps the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters who read text with loud in caricatures Woody Woodpecker of late age does not matter in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to a redundant dialogue like this one. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are not able to recognize that he has directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it.
