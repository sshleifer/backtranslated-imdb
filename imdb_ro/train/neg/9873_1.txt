I saw her with my mother and I was like ... What the hell? I did not succeed. Maybe I was wrong, but a chair was related to the death of this woman's father. The movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie. Bad suspense film! * shake the reed on film * I never see it again. And I'm a big fan of the movies all over my life! They have to give up trying to make movies outside the books. It's driving me crazy! And Whit was ugly-ugly, and yet she loves him more than Hugh, which was a pretty nice look to me. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
