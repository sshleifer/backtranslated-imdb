This story has died! Eventually, Nell is all heroic and takes the team to save all the Hill House ditches and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added the heads that were cut, the threads of the people and the ceiling turned into a huge hand! What the fuck is this? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is that it scares you so much without showing the ghost. There is no gore. There is no ceiling hand. It's just ghost gathering how ghosts can really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us in the room or throw us the knife in the head. Not. They can only upset us. Removing all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wants good things for herself. Yeah, he cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont took a stupidity on this great story! I hate this damn remake!
