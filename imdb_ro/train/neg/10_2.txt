This film had a lot of promises, and the plot was relatively interesting, but actors, directors and publishers have seriously left the movie. I feel bad about the writers, it could have been good. The act is wooden, very few of the characters are credible. Whoever has ever edited this has clearly learned some new editing techniques and wanted to spill it all over the film. There are a lot of quick edits in each scene, which are clearly designed to be symbolic, but to become equally annoying. I wanted to like this movie and I expected it to be a decent resolution to break the balance, but unfortunately it did not let me feel like I wasted my time, and filmmakers lost money.
