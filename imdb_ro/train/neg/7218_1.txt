There is a scene next to the start after a horseshoe fire exchange. If something red catches your eye, it's because a white truck is parked behind a bush next to the trail. I thought I saw bad, but that's it. A white truck in the west. Did not they get that? Well, and I paid a top dollar for rent. This will make you want to take your friends and put them in 10 seas and make a better movie. The speech was so slow, the action was largely good, but could not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of the filming. There is a door to sheriffs, which today looks like a door with special cutting. I want to watch this movie and move the boy in the # 2 Cabin to the worst of all time.
