If there is a movie that is the worst this year - it's TASHAN The first promo has given a clue that the movie will be a boring Dhoom 2 movie and I knew first that it would be a bad movie no matter what it was a Yashraj movie Or maybe I see the cheese promotion But this movie gave me a shock, it was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what was waiting for the introduction of the first Saif that is boring then Saif-Kareena meets, Kareena is so Artificial and then Anil Kapoor God, what does he do in such a strange movie? What is the role? What does he do? His first scene is fine, but then his act repeats itself and he gets upset. Then came Akshay who offered some beautiful scenes, but then the movie became more boring and with all the outdated things of love for children, Rajnikant childhood scene overdoses in style of action and all the boring scenes The end is another joke Vijay Krishna Acharya (Vishal Shekhar) is accustomed Akshay Kumar's performance comes in the film as if the movie was working, that's the yashraj's strategy, just the money nothing else Vijay is another addition to their music list (Vishal Shekhar) a whiff of fresh air, he actually offers some interesting moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is just as bad Anil Kapoor hams scandalous and overturning the show even more. The rest is all right
