This piece of dirt is almost impossible to follow. Sound is bad, image quality goes from bad to worse, from good to bad again! Things happen because no apparent reason does not appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during his production? Poor movie to the side, the story is bad just sick bad sh * t If you like rape, murder and self-harm this is even up alley. And if the scenes simulated by murder are not enough, you can enjoy the moments of real people who are running. I looked at almost everything, but I had to quit after I saw some broken brains. I never saw a movie that made me feel so shameful and dirty.
