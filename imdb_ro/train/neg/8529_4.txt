What gob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place Clark Gable as a Rescue Army worker? Ironically, another upcoming star, Cary Grant, also played a type of rescue army just two years later, in a highly overrated, it has done badly. I think it's easy enough to see the foolishness of these roles in the back, but I still wonder who thought the Salvation Army boys were "warm" and who could look at these good people and see realistic representations of the parties on who played them. A long time ago, I worked for a Saving Army sister organization (America Volunteers) and NEVER saw any boy working there (and that includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army instead! So for the most curious, this is a good movie to look for, but for everyone else, it's low, annoyingly moralizing writing for a very slow film.
