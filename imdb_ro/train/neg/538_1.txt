Wow, what a loss of talent. My husband and I stayed there, both of them thinking, that's got to be better, these actresses are too good to waste their time on these crap. Unattractive characters, hackneyed scenario and lightless pacing for a long time of two hours. In fact, I could not hack her and let her do the grocery shopping (cat cat being more appealing than this movie). The husband has stayed and confirmed that he has not improved - until Buddy was killed, you would have liked everyone to be hit by a car and end his miserable life. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful landscapes and costumes can not keep them alive.
