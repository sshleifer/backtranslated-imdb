The woman with the wig who "dips" her hair in the middle of the movie probably does not see what the audience can see miles away: <br /> <br /> the spoiler alert starts ** ** that hubby has an adventure with the most good girlfriend and they try to get rid of her. *** The end of the spoiler warning *** And what a spoiler that was: the title already gives it away, is not it? Bad action, bad writing: loss of time Oh da: in the end, she always lives happily after .... If you liked this movie, you really love "cannibal women in avocado Jungle of Death" ....
