Take a SciFi Original movie and mix in a small revision / revisionist story and get "Aztec Rex". Apparently, Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec Empire, had to conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and a pair first. That's the force of this movie. Considering the plot could really suck; the fact that only a kind of aspiration is a peak of the cover for writers. There are some problems. For starters, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose who plays Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers indigenous peoples in Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be played by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Taking aside, T-Rex (looks) looks reasonably well, though every time one of them is shot, he just scattered CGI. And I die too easily; I suppose if a T-Rex had been in real life, he might have been thrown or at least injured by some 16th-century, rather rudimentary weapons. But it takes something from the movie. There are also some T-Rex swallowing human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There is a lot of action, and the whole colonization angle is predominant throughout, but it does not overwhelm the angle of dinosaurs, unlike the other recent SciFi Original Dinosaur movie "Warbirds." Overall, a mediocre (but decent SciFi Original) movie that evaluates a modest 4.
