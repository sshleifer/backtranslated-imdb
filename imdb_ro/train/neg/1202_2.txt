A dog found in a local kennel is coupled with Satan and has a bunch of chickens, one of which is given to a family who has just lost his dog to a blow and fleeing. The puppy does not want to make time as Donald Trump and throws the Mexican maid, as festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is more than just appearing, and the rest of the family loves the demonic poet. So it's up to my father to say the day. This 70-year-old made for horror movie TV does not really go for it, except for a bad feeling of nostalgia. When I saw her as a child, I realized it was a tense nail pad, but as an adult, I realize now that it is simply blade, boring and not very well acted in no case. <br /> My degree: D
