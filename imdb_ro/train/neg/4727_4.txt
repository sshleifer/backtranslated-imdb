This movie is really something of pure egg, good in parts. Unlike other commentators, we have found that the main mistake with her is the inability to attract spectators' interest in characters and plotting. I stayed there because I was interested in rock'n'roll and lane dynamics, but if I had evaluated it just on the basis of its merit as a movie, I should have fingered it down with a few warnings: Jason Behr is good in John Livien's part and quite convincing as a rock singer; the story of his childhood trauma is unclear, although it gives us clues in Livien's well-related relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre for the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using a scene personality to solve internal conflicts is interesting, although it is not new and is not fully explored as a theme in this film. The fixtures to John Lennon were irritating, but I confess I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that it was something derived around them. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way he opened it with some interesting - though wonderful and high school - philosophical features of the main character, but left the wires of his thought there, just to pick them up again in the middle of the very short film, when Livien says: "Before God, it was music" (did you ever see this announcement for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "before time, did Tia Maria exist?" seems an idiotic conclusion, and the spectator has no idea about but fortunately, his bassist and friend, played with the ability of Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the error of this thinking when he answers "You do not know." In all, the limited powers of the direction and the plot could go either on future projects or in unnecessary banality or in an interesting and mature perspective.
