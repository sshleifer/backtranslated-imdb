I do not give it too often "on the ones", but if there ever was a movie that deserves such attention, it's "Gas!" This is an indulgent stupidity that reaches for part of the atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and collapses completely on his face in an attempt to see. Corman Goes - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's role in the original M * A * S * H ​​movie with a similar plot (in the movie "Whiffs" - look it up here in IMDb, http: // www .imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). Marmorstein and Gould approached the brass ring with "Whiffs" than Corman did with "Gas!" but it did not get enough there. None of these films came close to the success of M * A * S * H. What's wrong with "Gas!"? What is not? No one is really approaching to act at a higher level than high-school theaters. Production values ​​are moving. Someone else here mentioned the magical regeneration headlights on an escape machine, and more than that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as is supposed in this movie and nobody cares. "Gas!" in fact, he put me to sleep. It's not a safe cure for insomnia, but very close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction, "Gas!" is somewhere between "Last year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's remake of "Solaris" (which was remarkable to be more boring than the original version of Mosfilm despite the unfamiliar aspect of the studio with the idea of ​​maintaining the public attention through judicious editing. <br /> Judicious editing would decimate "Gaz!" in about twenty minutes, the result would be useless, but no more than the original film. convincing quality that makes them worth watching anyway.This is not one of them.You do not waste your time It's not even funny.
