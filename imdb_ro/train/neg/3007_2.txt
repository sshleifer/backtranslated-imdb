Well, in the endless search of horror, we will meet this movie, apparently re-released on DVD recently for unending reason. The transfer is terrible, and the quality is just the worst. I do not think this is due to an evil remaster or something, I think the movie is badly done. Obviously filmed at an abandoned school, with a budget that was undoubtedly scattered by cheap beer and no talent for hacks, Slaughter High starts slowly and does not lift the rhythm until about an hour in. First, we get to see a "nerd" as selected by a group of ... In fact, do I even know what should be ... jocks? The leader, with his ultra hook, is so ugly that he should surely be castrated as a nerd. Then there is a "big guy" and a couple of bad losers and chickens who should be "hot" but they are not. It is a mystery for this group of rejections to choose one of them, but I think the spectator must assume that they are "wonderful children" on a dweeb. Casting choices are terrible because most students are playing for thirty years. As other reviewers have highlighted, the actors (if you can call them) are a bunch of Britons whose accents have shed many times in this piece of nonsense. We are supposed to assume that this group of "children" were the only students in this school, because their "reunion" is only at school, which now turns out to be abandoned, is just them. <br /> <br /> Killing is blades, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; such as "This place gives me creeps ..." and "Someone to make a beer" are underlined ... It's not good. Skip this if you are not wasted with friends and want to laugh at a real slasher lame test. If you want to look well, you get Bava's "Blood Gulf" 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good BAD curse, you can see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10 children.
