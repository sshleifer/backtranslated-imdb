Why did I waste my money on this last Sundance day? I want a refund ... Can I give you $ 16 back? While I was watching this movie, I waited for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew what was supposed to be about was reading the plot, which was not exactly the movie. why did the director increase his room and then diminish his image? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show that Lulu has his fingernails for fifteen minutes? Why when the actors tried to talk, did they sound like they read? Or was it the point? I felt that the Love Ghost had no story at all, and to be honest, I felt my holiday friends had a much higher value than this movie.
