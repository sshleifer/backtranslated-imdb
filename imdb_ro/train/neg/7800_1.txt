Beyond the dirt, this shot-on-video exercise in the ineptitude was difficult to pass. It has the typical gore that you would expect in a zombie movie, but no atmosphere required to make it worth the time. What's strange is that this is a German amateur video, and the version I saw is English-called! Dubars seem to be American fans (German pens?!) Who can not decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy. A character (of course a German white) is called by a seemingly black guy who speaks with thick ebony! - Kno wahm sayin, Comrad?
