Dolph Lundgren multiplies and strives to go through this incoherent mystery / thriller that's not as cool as the box you thought. In fact, he's pretty good here, but the story is a mess of the B-movie cliques (detectives, revengers, magnates, prostitutes, S & M) that show that they were made while they were walking. The film takes a bit in the second half, but for a better shot of Lundgren instead of renting RED SCORPION.
