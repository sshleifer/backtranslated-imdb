In the sixth grade, every teacher I've decided is a great idea to make this film a curriculum for a full semester. Each class has something to do with this terrible show. I followed her in English and wrote in magazines as if I were one of the characters. In mathematics I talked about graphics and other sea shells. In science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so it was not a waste of 100% time). Every day every day was torture. Not only that, but we would be subjected to this horror twice a day, making us follow them in the study room. I saw if it was a new series or something, but it was, for example, '93. I'm still trying to block this.
