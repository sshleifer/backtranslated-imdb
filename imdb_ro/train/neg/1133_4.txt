I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts. Many scenarios work in a plug-and-play mode strictly embedded to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually, this is fine because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge in general is to become original, new and inventive. This movie fails to do so. There is no sense of who the characters are except Sylvie Moreau (which is the true star of this film, not Isabelle Blais). They fall into this one-dimensional clich√© and they become nothing but simple dolls that serve the purpose of a very light narrative. Pacing the movie can become annoying, lacking in rhythm, and editing is filled with useless photos. I should also mention styles that are too stylized, making some scenes indifferent to anything naturally or rather trying to seem natural too obvious. Of course, besides, you have the right music to tell you that, unfortunately, it often seems unsuitable. I can not believe that a movie that alludes to Woody Allen obviously ends up being misleading. If you expect a romantic comedy at hand, that's not. Or, rather, this is a weak attempt at this. You will let the theater wonder why this movie received such praise when the cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are much better Quebecois directors doing more movies. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it is a bad thing if you consider cinema as art and executives as a builder.
