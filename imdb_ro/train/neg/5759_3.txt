This is the third parody of frightening films and we hope it's the last one. This time the parody is mainly on Ring, Signs and 8 Mile for some strange reasons. In my opinion, this movie was very useless and useless and not really funny. I laughed three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I liked the first two very much, but it was just bad. If your jokes consist of dead bodies and people throwing things constantly between them, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if smart enough to stay at home and save money and please stop making such movies, they will get worse 3/10.
