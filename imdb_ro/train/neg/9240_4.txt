The idea of ​​making a miniseries about the Berlin aerodrome seemed to me one of the most interesting German films (post-war). It's a theme that has not yet been explored. However, the manufacturers in this series filled it with the cliché. It already begins with the DVD cover of the movie, which is a direct copy of the "Pearl Harbor" cover. Luis Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) comes to hear that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war struggles to survive. He finds a job at the American base, gets to work for the hottest and highest officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love with her, gets pregnant, and suddenly her husband comes back. Come on!!! I've seen this once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; Bettina Zimmermann never seems to convinced. For some reasons, it always seems too late to give the right emotional reaction to scenes. It just did not work for me. Airplane and airplane action scenes, we are sometimes interesting, more often than not. Unpleasant things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. If you are not a big fan of World War II films, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
