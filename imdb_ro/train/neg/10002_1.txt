I'm sorry for everyone, I know it should be an "artistic" movie, but you should throw weapons at screening so people throw their arms and not look. Although the scene design and the photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. Photos were too long. How long can you watch two people sitting there talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complain. It really was hard to get through this movie. The shows were excellent, but how much can you take this dark, dark and uninspired thing? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and the red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, it was a waste of Bergman. And I'm not his fan. I think someone who says he enjoyed 1Â½ hours of this is, okay, mind.
