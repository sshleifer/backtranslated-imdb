On a distant planet, a psychopath is saved by the execution of a space monk. He releases some inmates and breaks out of prison in a space ship. They sit on an enormous space ship that orbits a supernova star. This massive craft is populated by only three people, probably because the film budget has not expanded to hiring many actors. However, to shorten the long story, the three goodies end up in a cat and mouse game with wicked ones. Psycho in this movie is curious in that it is annoying. Generally, "annoying" is not a term used to describe a fool - fearless, frightening, dangerous, but not "annoying", but he is. The three men who fit the giant ship are seriously unconvinced because they guarantee such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! Since the film is set around 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that there may be a huge artificial craft, never being used for such a relatively mundane task. Despite the large dimensions of the spacecraft, the crew has great kittens, small rooms and dining room consisting of what appears to be a table and plastic chairs. But there are a lot of corridors. The film is pretty well acted and works as a sci-fi thriller on average. But nothing great.
