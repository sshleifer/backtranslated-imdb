With this distribution and budget you will expect more. John Cusack has made a number of films that border on strange but still work. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this trash of tribal waste dumb writing. The film is nothing but a series of visions and poor at that. The land does not go anywhere, writing is contrived, meaningless, and thin characters. If you think of a three-dimensional film, where the story and the characters give a depth of the images, this stinker meets as thin as the mickey ship. Dan Akroyd's appearance brought back the memories of someone else's truly horrible film, 1991 Nothing but trouble. Honestly this movie is the type of project that kills your career and becomes trained agents.
