The cinematic version of Sandra Bernhard's single-woman off-Broadway show is demanding. Sandra spoofs acts by the lounge and superstars, but her sense of irony is just interesting exciting, funny and funny. His fans will say he is strictly honest, and perhaps it is true. But she is also strident, with a non-apologetic bestial in the face that is not suitable for a movie of this genre. He does not want to do nice-and certainly does not make his friends-and that will always rub a lot of people in the wrong way. But even if you meet her half, her material here is seriously missing. Cinematographer Nicolas Roeg was an executive producer and, although not directed by him, the film has its slim, detachable and detachable style. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their most strange touch was that all of Sandra's audiences looked completely bored - a very likely feeling that many viewers would share. * 1/2 from ****
