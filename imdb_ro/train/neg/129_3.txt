I Am Curious is indeed two films in half of them is Lena's sexual experimental part, and the other half is her curiosity about politics / socialism. Whatever the director's intention, the two do not really come together. The director should have stayed with Lena's romantic side and made a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war reunions, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flopping breasts and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Besides interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored with watching this movie. Unlike many other commentators, I think nude / sex scenes are outdated for what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. Generalized nudity is a major distraction to any plot that exists. I think distribution has done a good job. They played their parts credibly. There are few things I've been accustomed to seeing in American films at this time.
