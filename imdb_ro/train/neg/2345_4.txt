I looked at Written on the Wind with Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just bloody - he should have been a charming millionaire with chips - instead, the go-fence was bad and overwhelmed, and the 3 "romantic" did not have chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - though her trampoling character was boring - I think the bigger sister in Splendor in Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking in charisma. Director Douglas Sirk made all kinds of speeches through the dialogue that felt forced, and the final result was a 99-minute loss. He had a cameo by the actor who played the boss on Get Smart
