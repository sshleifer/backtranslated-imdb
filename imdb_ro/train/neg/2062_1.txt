I've read all reviews here AFTER I watched this piece of cinematographic trash and took at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think this terribly unfortunate fit was not the humor of humor in the '70s or indeed another era! If it is not the least funny set of comedy * sketch * I've ever seen will do until it comes along. Half of the skits have already been (and infinitely better) of acts like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I said that a beautiful animation piece that takes about 90 seconds is the culmination of this movie, close to the exact summary of how this waste of 75 minutes is lost. Comedy Comedy? Only in the world where seeds really DOES mean sperm. The purpose of humor? Only in a world where scales are actually feces. The jokes of precursors? Only by this we understand that this is a manual about how not to make comedy. Breasts and vagabonds and strange castor. Nice ... if you're a pubescent boy with at least one free hand and you did not find that there was Playboy. Give him a break because it was the early '70s? No way. It was a sketch comedy that turned back at least ten years ago. The only way I can forgive this movie is if it was on the gun. Retro? Hard. The sketches about clowns, subtly perverted children, could be marginal in some circles (and it might be funny), but it just turns out to be quite sad. What made me go in the 75 minutes? You're convinced he could have saved a really fun game. I gave the movie 1 because it was not a inferior score ... and I can recommend it only to insomnia or coma patients ... or maybe to those who suffer from blockage ... their jaws will eventually fall open in unbelief.
