This was presented as part of the 59th International Festival in Edinburgh, though for the best reasons left by the powers that are. It seems to have been a great deal of the fact that it is the first Thai-language film, made with Thai actors and crews, but directed by a Western. You do not have to bother being honest because this movie is boring, boring, dull. Why suggest something, why surround an idea in the mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can collide the point with some terrible voice voices, obvious shots and over the top scenes> Nothing is left to the imagination from time to time when director Spurrier tightens endless encirclements. Without an allusion, without guess, everything is on the screen, we do not have to use our imagination. Do you wonder when the "scary" bit? You will not get used to, because the soundtrack will become more and more intimidating, rising to a crescendo of threat. Hell, I'm doing some words to describe how bad this is. Wonders whether the conjugal demon is real or imaginary? Why tax you - is indeed a snake, and yes, indeed, his legs bite and there is blood that shines everywhere. is a strange, unsettled movie for many reasons. It should be a horror movie, but it is not scary - the shocks are flagged and obvious. It could be a disgusting attack on the wild part of Thailand, but the director has a loose, lubricating style when it comes to showing teenage girls barely pubescent. Maybe she throws herself as the veneration venerate who planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe everything was just pants. Uninspired, insipid, repetitive, hackneyed - all candidates for the best description, but boring seems the most appropriate and honest. Everything has been seen before, perhaps better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Take a look at each count. Really terrible.
