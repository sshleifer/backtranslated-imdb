Unfortunately, more downs than chances. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing unusual, but it had a story, unlike other modern horror films. The other good thing was the distribution. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it was not, but each actress / actress was hot and attractive. One of the downs is that the movie becomes interesting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another down (or you can think it a bit if you want) is excessive nudity. All four faces were topless for a few minutes, and all the boys showed their ass for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers." If you are not very desperate to look at a guy, take off your swimsuit and run naked for a few minutes or watch a naked naked girl or a fan of Debbie Rochon than this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a horror movie, stay away.
