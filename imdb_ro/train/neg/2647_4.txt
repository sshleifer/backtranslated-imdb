I will tell one thing about Jeanette and Nelson - even when they are stuck in a stupid musical, mindless, and painlessly steadfast like this one, there is still a wink in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry of the famous duo is there even when the material is thin on paper. Even when the score is practically a non-existent throw, it depends only on some appealing songs. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. The truth of saying, he has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real Ray Genemond in SMILIN 'THROUGH, which, however, was a much better film. I'm sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in his "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with an anxious state when faced with the most absurd situations. You can only ask what it was like Broadway in 1938. Of course, it must have been more wise and stylistic than it is evident in this poor MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fizzles in a nonfunctional role and none of the players who support him can breathe any appearance of life into this misery. It's like the amateur night in the studio, even with a few professionals who have been sprawled among those who supported the cast. Summing up: The painful writing of a musician, Rodgers and Hart. It can not be recommended, even for MacDonald and Eddy fans. And even if Jeanette's close-up pictures still shine with her beauty, this movie is bad.
