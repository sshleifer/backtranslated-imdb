<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap camcorder) may be one of the greatest cinematic bombs in history. Beware: The packaging promotes the film as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than watching the warts. The script is useless and meandering, with all the plot elements serving as segways between supposedly sex scenes. However, even sex scenes are blade lame blades. Except for the first, they last about three seconds (then again, maybe my version was cut off) and superficial, comic. If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want this. If you are looking for a shot of sex bitch, you do not. Regardless of the purposes, desires, or prospects of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. As they took Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act in this amazing bomb is embarrassed to the extreme.
