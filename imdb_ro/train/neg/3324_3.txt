I suddenly saw a lazy summer afternoon. It was played on HBO's family programming channel. At first I was attracted to what I thought was a Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself looking for the remote so I could find the "INFO BUTTON" to find out what the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing is not, he is a voice artist. Of course he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Attaching his voice to a nice duck made a pretty difficult view. As for the rest cast, uninspired. I suppose that working on this film did not appeal to the really good voice over the talent there. So poorly talented voice, strong animation ... who was this movie targeting? Gay? I do not understand. Is there really such a lack of role models for young gay men coming and coming, that we must resort to animated ducks? The cute story and, like the title, this movie I felt hard to be loved, like an ugly duckling.
