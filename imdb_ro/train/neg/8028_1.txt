Please! Do not waste money on this movie. It's nothing but a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by high school children. I could not see it, and I usually like to see all sorts of B movies. How could they find a distributor on earth for that? !!! Odd: Visit Wikipedia for the "dark area". The type who wrote the entry must be completely in the mind. Perhaps he has received a lot of money from the producers. The money he ought to have spent on actors, cameras, and editing. Even that would not have helped, because there is no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already received too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making such movies ... do not do a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
