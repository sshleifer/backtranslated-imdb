When you watch this show, you are not sure if the story or act is more annoying. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every possible clich√©, you can guess not only the general plot but the layout of the scenes and lines of each character, making the show a sort of collage of each police series there. On the top of everything comes the "message" of the show, that the good is good and that evil is bad and that at the end of the day the good will prevail and that we should all love one another, be better and better citizens , all made in the most apparent way. The actors, as vehicles of this message and nothing more, will use a limited set of acting skills: the smile "I am a good bearer," the worried look and body position "victory is ours," while bad boys have a "I'm stupid" message, frowning and showing "you caught me", followed by "I'm fine for nothing and I should be out of society" the general development of each show. The real story or not, the show is garbage, another proof that the producers do not give a say on the spectators, that we are all considered idiots. Well, this series makes all the possible attempts to idiot the living brain in you.
