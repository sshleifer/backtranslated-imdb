Simply, this is a simplistic and dimensional film. The title "Rise to Evil" should tell you that it will not try to be profound or make much of Hitler's character. Rather, from the very first minute of the movie in which we see the child that Hitler was showing evil with bad music playing in the background, we are given a view of Hitler, which presents him as a cardboard supervilan, apparently broken even from a TV show on Saturday morning. The REAL movie wants to make the case that Hitler was bad, but does anyone need a movie to convince Hitler that he was bad? Ultimately, turning it into such a one-dimensional bad character is both boring and confusing (you have to ask how the ineptic, psychic character of the cold movie ever convinces a nation to follow it or be called the Man of Time year). This movie had a great opportunity to take a figure who committed some of the worst acts of the twentieth century and tries to penetrate it. Instead, he just says "Hey, Hitler was bad! I thought you wanted to know ..." over and over again. The big irony is that the movie was still attacked because it presented a very sympathetic image of the character. Save me.
