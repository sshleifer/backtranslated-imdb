Okay, the crowd of the film festival probably loved it. But your average movie popcorn, which has overturned the ten or fifteen dollars, costs to watch a movie these days, probably wondering why she made this choice. If the "Copolla" is stamped, it's automatically wonderful, is not it? Wrong! It's a neat paradise of the film's claims. But it's great in. I worry when movie producers are more concerned with the entertainment than with the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curiosity and has a chicot or two in it. But once she runs her movie and TV course, dust will thicken on film boxes and tape boxes that keep it. Not even epoch or epic!
