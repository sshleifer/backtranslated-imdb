This movie is so bad it's funny. She sees Scott Backula as a coach, but that's not important, which is important is the big black playing the first base. First he must be at least 75 years old, but he still plays baseball of the minor league, secondly he starts the movie in the outfield, despite not being able to go, let alone run. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly, citing him first that when he tries to run, he stays in the same place for too long. Backula presents a brighter coaching strategy at the end of the movie, (SPOILER), tells his star player "in the center of the city" to hit a home run, clearly "the city center", seeing this as a good move. He hit home and won the match for his team, a minor league team that played the Gemini who were the class of major filmmakers. Now, if only Tony Muser, the Royals manager, would be as smart as a coach like Backula and would tell his players to simply hit a home run each and every time, Royals will never end a turn to you miss another game.
