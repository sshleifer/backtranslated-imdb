It was a waste of time. Danger: If you watch it, you will be tempted to destroy your DVD from the wall and lift it through the window. An amateur production: terrible, repetitive, vacuous dialogue; thin line plot paper; wooden shows; Lucy Lawless was tricked. Seriously erroneous story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) evil twins, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. The plot "twisted"? Scandalously simplistic and obvious - as if you were following a train that descends down the runway in the middle of the day on the prairie. It does not even solve correctly. Evil is not punished for the initial offense. Please, please do not look at this, even if her freedom and your only choice is to go to a synagogue.
