I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous poster of MEATBALLS and I saw it must be the best satire ever. What a genius idea for a satire - the genre is lively. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think everyone is likely to realize) is a catalog of missed opportunities, of some performances that are not quite there and (fortunately!) Some extremely hilarious, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks very bad here, probably because he is struggling uncomfortably to make him play a funny role. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch, trying to be hard to be funny and look like a fucking Castro. Molly Shannon is so funny, just seeing she makes you laugh, but somehow her segment fails to crash into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teen manners and was sexy like hell, the other guys are also very funny (the relatives). I think the problem is that the director just does not move things along the right pace. He starts very far away, and that's what the monotone puts. But when he lets things get really scandalous (the drug sequence is the second funniest movie I've ever had in the movies, the first one coming in a blade movie: Andrea Martin all over the world, who complains about the movie IN & OUT) is simply fun. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just did not. The clothes and style for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as an average-bad TV MAD episode, complete with long-lasting frustrating sketches.
