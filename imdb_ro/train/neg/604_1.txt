I was so disgusted with this movie, I felt compelled to warn others. This movie has no story, no plot or no clue. The film starts after the standard introduction of the movie "Allows To Be Awesome", which so far every film observer has become accustomed to. So we can ignore the beginning completely. We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to everyone you just wasting those who have won hard and you'd better watch static. (Unless you have seen the white noises - EEK) Action is a DISTRIBUTION and everyone should go back to the pantomime by traveling where they came from. That being said, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this movie a remote viewing. Their poor performance only contributes to disaster. Violence without violence and what I can only assume is the written word of another "eccentric" junked writer, who probably thinks of being an artist, has led to a movie that will test your patience. It was not until my supervisor turned to me and said, "I watched this for 45 minutes," I realized that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Obviously something was missing, and unfortunately it was not the public. Rather than suggesting what the film lacks, let me tell you what she has: Blonde (surprise surprise), Victim, bad-monster-type thing, about 2 minutes of story that stretches over hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit weird looking for some of the scenes, but she expects to want to see her cut face for the rest of the movie!
