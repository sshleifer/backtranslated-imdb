This film, once sensational about its forward thinking policy and the images of free love and sexual release, has been reduced to the mere curiosity. It seems absurd now that this less boring film was banned and confiscated by governments in many countries. Considering how it finally became Socialist Sweden, the "radicalism" of its controversial, once controversial politics seems naive and almost four decades later. And his sexual scenes, at some point the subject of sensational obscenity attempts, seem pretty bountiful in a modern context. However, the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remain marginal to be watched as an early reliquary of youth rebellion in the 1960s. Part of the film still remains: self-awareness of the "fourth wall ". From time to time filmmakers are filming in the film. The satirical fight of this still causes a chicot.
