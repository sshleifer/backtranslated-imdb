I think the biggest failure he can have is boring. Evil is actually better than boring. This has no breath. It has an interesting fact to be held in Cambodia. How many American films have taken place in Cambodia. However, the conflict is hard to find. Even the movements of the troops are a little confusing. What drives her to a resounding stop is the love story. Why these two guys are so enthusiastic about the little blonde I do not know. I thought she should continue to use Zombies (as they are) and forget everything about her. The film is flowing over time. The perfect microcosm is the place where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphs (or whatever) explain how to turn people into zombies. I thought they would never get there. A guy has two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind some bushes. This is the short story. Then there is a bad and insipid dialogue. I have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. That's not enough. By the way, a better title would be His Hypnotic Revolt.
