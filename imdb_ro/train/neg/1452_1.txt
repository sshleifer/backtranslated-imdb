In 1919 to 1933 Germany does not appear to be a post-war Czech chapter. I'm sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's 2003, how funny. This is one of the most terrible history films in the closest past. Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so good, Göring looks like 40 when he is only 23 years old, and "Führer" always looks like 56. And the buildings, the people, even the buildings were sometimes young. Especially 1919 were a lot of houses in Germany almost new (World War I does not reach German cities!). No plaster! Then, Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, never. And this may seem like a miracle: in 1933, the Berlin Fire Brigade has many motor vehicles, some even with turntable stairs, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the last sequence? For me this was a kind of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
