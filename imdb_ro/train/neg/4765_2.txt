While the original prevents the intellect, this inexpensive remake is designed only to shock sensitivities. Instead of complicated plotting, this so-called thriller has only sudden and seemingly random changes that only serve to debate it with every bizarre development. Worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue is a jumping salt jumper, full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a strong but uninteresting taste. It was a promise - an unfulfilled promise. The prospect that Michael Caine to graduate Keller-to-Sullivan from Patty Duke is often interesting. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has not destroyed his reputation, first by accepting his role in this terribly re-scripted foolishness and then transforming it into a performance that seems only competent compared to Jude Law's deception. > If you have not seen the classic, do not forget to see visuals and tricks. Watch it, watch and enjoy a story and a half. As for the remake, please forward this insult to the original.
