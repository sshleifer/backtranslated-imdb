It was certainly the most stupid, cruel and most repulsive movie I've ever seen. I was tempted to stop the video camera, but, as in the fascination with a terrible car accident, I literally found it harassing in all possible ways, and I let it go all the way. I'm not at all a cautious object to the comedic screen of sexually antique. Animal House, Porky's, something about Mary, both American Pie movies, and even the famous Freddy Got Fingered, I found very nice on their rough terms. Mamie Van Doren of sponge cotton sponge is the most dreadful aspect by a naked geriatric from Shining. Edited and shot, with incredibly upsetting performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the movie ended, without the benefit of making me chicote once. The only useful purpose for the film is as an example of a manual to not make a rough picture. Oh, and would also be nice like a lawn fertilizer.
