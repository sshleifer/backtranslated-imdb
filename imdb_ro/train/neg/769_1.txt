The main thing about this movie is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be thrown into a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing the soft voice of David Lansbury, who struggles with the work with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech, it was impossible to believe that someone would ever consider him for the role. So I thought he did not take the part because he was a terrible actor; not because a larger name was available. Then, when we see the portions of the play in rehearsal, it is hard to believe that the director does not parody things with hopeless misery, a wrong transvestity of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the lyrics and directors who see the game through their own screwdriver interpretations. Sometimes directors are so eager to make their films (and writers think they have the ability to straighten their own works) so that they do less. This seems to be such an example.
