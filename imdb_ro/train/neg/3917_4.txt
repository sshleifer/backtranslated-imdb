"The House of Spirits" is quite terrible. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship just like the one she's trying to describe the film, and even if everyone knows the movies can be far from reality, this film treats viewers both ignorant, and fools. Things are not as straightforward and straightforward as it appears here, and of course the political process is more complicated and more interesting than the plot in the House. If you can not show that complexity on the screen is better not to make any movie at all. There are a lot of examples of how politics in cinema can be seriously taken without so many common places. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda could appear in parrots and palm trees. When you talk about certain things, you have to be not only careful, but also respectful of your audience's intelligence.
