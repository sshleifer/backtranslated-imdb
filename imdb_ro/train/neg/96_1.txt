.. Wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical movie snob, unless you want to brush your typical cinematic definitions such as "edit continuity" and "geographic match." I can not tell where I was in this movie. One second I'm assuming in the next minute that I was driving a modern SUV in the 1970s and wearing what seemed to me to be 80-style clothing. I could not give him enough attention, since the act was horrible. I think he just got attention because he has a 3d that I did not watch. If you are a b-movie buff, and b-movie I want to say BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's the movie at home and all the non-sense style will make you laugh as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, however, jump over that.
