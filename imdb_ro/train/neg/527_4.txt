Shared to die in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she leaves she tells her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... This is one of those movies that have the look and the expectations of being a great movie because they have so much many actors and great actresses in it, so it seems to be about something other than the one that really is. It's not as bad as it is, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all featuring fine performances) than a harlequin story. Wait for the cable.
