I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit it was not a cup of tea. Though it should be a horror film of this kind. But when I looked at it, I thought ... "This movie does not make any sense at all ..." Where did this guy come from the dark coat? Where were the two going when they left the girls behind? Where did a shark come from the earth? All of these elements in this movie have not been added. I felt like when these producers lost so much time and money on a movie that was so compelled to be so shit. I've seen many horror films in my time, but this is one of the most horrible blows I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I said I would not follow him anymore. So much pappy looks in this movie, I decided to give her my thumb! Count me on this! 0 out of 10!
