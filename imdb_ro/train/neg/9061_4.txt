What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier, I watched Lillies and this was one of the best Gay movies I've ever seen. So it was not the best time to watch a Gay movie. The story was stupid and the action was fine. It was not bad enough to stop, but it had bad moments and some terrible stereotypes. It was not very well expressed. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you're wasting your time and money. I do not understand why such films are being made and who finances them. Spend time Watch instead Noah's Arc on Logo. I think this is where this movie is trying to go, but it never went there.
