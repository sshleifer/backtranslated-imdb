Flanking and newspaper campaigns have suggested (whenever they did) a much more agitated and violent play than appeared on drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has been working in films for years. This is hard to find; I would love to see it again to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember how it is particularly impressive when. It was probably a cut version that she did in theaters and video in the US. But that, that sheet ... another jewel of my horror collection later.
