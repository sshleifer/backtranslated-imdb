When you convert a book into a movie, it's generally a good idea to keep at least part of the intentional tone or concepts conveyed by the author, rather than ignoring the author altogether. Although it is clear that the director had access to and advised Elinore Stewart's children, it is essential to remind our children that their mother was a complete liar about good, enriching and hard-hitting experiences of storing their land. The book details her life on her and her husband's adjacent households in the vast Wyoming border; she chronicled her daily adventures with her many friends and acquaintances, though they lived tens of miles apart. The film, however, has a standard position for the time it has been done, presenting this woman's experience as harsh, unforgiving and almost useless. Perhaps the director brought some of his experiences with the Vietnam War with him to this film (as some movie fans have said), but it seems like a bad excuse to take all the joy and beauty of the book and turn it into a landscape horribly devoid of friends or hope. Do not waste your time with this movie; read the book instead.
