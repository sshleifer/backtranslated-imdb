This movie gets a score of 6/10 from me as well as a 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror film for the standard horror group, where action and gore and scarecots are taken into account, this movie will wear you. It's essentially a family drama similar to the one you'll see on the Lifetime channel, but set in a horror universe. The story and formula are old, detained hundreds of times. If you look for any originality in the plot structure or minimum conflicts, you will be disappointed. Remove zombies and you will have something as melodramatic as a beautiful mind, preventing cheese. This is 6/10. However, the basic synopsis and idea are quite original and from the beginning. It's literally something that you and your friends would joke when you're half a drink. . . but that joke actually has a theatrical release. The idea is 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is that he could have taken it even more, but they did not. The mixture of both is mixed. I thought it was fun, but as with all comedies, it was not funny HERE. I had my mother and my sister look at me and the jokes I did about it were funnier than the jokes written. There have been moments of total genius, but there have also been moments of pure boredom. I sincerely hope that other movies make this type of risk on the head and original ideas. I can not say that it was perfect or close, because of the lack of originality of the plot. A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a bunch of boys (or girls). A great movie to watch with someone. . . but if you look at it yourself, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this movie more fun and richer. 4/10
