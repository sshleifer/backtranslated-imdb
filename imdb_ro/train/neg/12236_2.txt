Simply this should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©. The screen chemistry that made the first "My Little Girl" so captivating is not to be found here, and the action in its entirety is embarrassed and forced. Writing leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines, such as "embracing a barbarous habit," are just shocking. If "My Little Girl" caused a genuine sense of sadness and really funny moments, such as so many sequels, "My Girl 2" tries to recreate these audience-generated emotions and does not succeed at all. Maybe I'm working on this movie because of how big it was first, but frankly insulting the quality of the original with some sort of trouble this amount raises. Of course, this must come close to "the mask of the mask" as one of the most serious sequelae of all time. In both cases, the old adage is true; "if it's not broken, do not fix it."
