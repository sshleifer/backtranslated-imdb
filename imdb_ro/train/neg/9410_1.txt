As long as you can suffer! If you like watching people wake up, get up, dress up, take a shower, prepare dinner, look at each other, have sex in the dark, then sleep at bedtime ... if you like glued homes, kitchens, long minutes of silence ... If you like to bore yourself for two hours, feel the thrill of "real intimate false art," then you will love it. But if you do not, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you're here," but do we want to stay? This German film received the prize for the homosexual film festival in Turin: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision because the festival has featured many talented films. Can you be nice to a German because they do not often receive prizes? Well, "The Life of Others" did ... but this is excellent, but not gay. Maybe it's fashion. The Germans are "in" again? No matter what? Or maybe just for a good look at some directors?
