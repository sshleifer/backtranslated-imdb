Almost halfway, I realized I was never interested in these characters; however, I have seen a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I should not have bothered. If you know anything about the movie in advance, you know the main character will be a survivor of the plane - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what's going to happen afterwards - call the phone and call people on it! That was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another evil catastrophe blow). I realize that this is an old film, and the style of acting in those days was much less natural than today. But even after these standards, the act was embarrassing. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this movie was, more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). However, it did not have any results - I saw that oaks look more authentic than she did. Davis played the happy happy role (ie an unfortunate role) in moving the career. It was not. It was just boring. He was a sort of Tiny Tim in the movie, making Trask (the character of Merrill) see the truth about love and forgiveness (though it was less wonderful than Tiny Tim), releasing calm wisdom about life and relationships without a suggestion that her beloved husband just died. The final scene, in which Trask calls his wife back to Iowa to be reconciled, was so affected and accused by both ends of the telephone line, almost cracked. I had to remember that these people were paid for what they were doing in this film. I've noticed that a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you find her uplifting, it's great. But, honestly, I felt sorry. There are a lot of Hollywood Golden Age old movies that were much better written and acted.
