I had the free weekend from STARZ and started the post to see what was going on. It was this Howling II movie: The actor was terrible, but the candy were wonderful. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I laughed a lot from a few scenes I've seen. My friends wonder why I never want to go to Horror, If they see this movie, they would know why. I would have thrown myself out to laugh so hard. Just a few trivia notes: Reb Brown who played Ben White starred American captain in a TV movie Marsha Brown was inspiring Mick Jaggers for the play "Brown Sugar" Mick has an excellent taste for women certainly.
