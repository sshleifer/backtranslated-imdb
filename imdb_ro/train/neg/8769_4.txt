This was a movie I was hoping to suggest to my American friends. But after four attempts to watch the movie to finish, I knew I could not even see what the hell was shutting down. You are almost convinced that the current war has not lasted even so much. Others will try to question my patriotism for the criticism of a movie like this one. But no problem, you can not look at saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the difference in the budget of the movie or the public - they do not exclude a director from making a smart film. The length of the movie is not so bad and repetitive - they continue to attack the same hill, but give it different names. I thought LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill seemed like my yard. The character development sequences (soilders' flashbacks, looking at the last moments before being installed) should have been throughout the movie and not just in a long memory. So far I have not followed the end. But there was a much better film (I do not say much) called Border.
