Following the success of the (horrific) film on the island of Gilligan's Island, several TV films were made in the 1980s, from the classical shows. Most of these films missed the boat completely until the humor recapitulation that made such special performances. MUNSTERS REVENGE is one of the most disappointing, because it's a Laurel and Hardy comedy style that really was not in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful and essential comedy for the series, is completely wasted - has less time here in this 90-minute film than it did in any 30-minute episode. And since the roles "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this movie are nothing but cameo, which was the purpose of making them younger and reforming them? With very little rewriting, he could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although he saw that some of Munsters' relatives were a pleasant touch, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as a crazy scientist, especially because there are too many and not many of the Munsters in the comedy, Imogene Coca, was , also inappropriately expressed in much of a reunion of the movie TV RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another inexplicable odd at the beginning of the film is the Munster family represented as a wax at a local horror wax museum. Why would they be there when it should be a typical American (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was Munsters' last project, which had the original role in his roles, a terrifying revival of the series at the end of the 1980s, with a completely new cast and a 1990 TV film that included DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick in a cameo roll a family meal.
