Phew - I have nothing to say. This is a movie that could be very good with a bunch of viewers. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' early offers. Maybe I should take it back - I do not want to insult Waters as a director / storyteller. I really enjoyed the lawyer taking into account the "full faith and credibility" clause. It is also "full faith and faith" by the way! This reminds me of "Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. multi-stakeholder businesses such as those that are probably best left by highly experienced film professionals who would have the technical ability (though a stunt, some might say) do something like that.
