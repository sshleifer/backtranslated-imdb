This story is about the romantic triangle of a n. Male African prostitutes, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak any French and never seems to laugh. The film is boring, disturbing and depressing, shot either on a fog, in winter days or in illuminated interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, because the white balance has come out. Everyone is pale and thrown down and looks dizzy, shaky and dirty. The bodies are bones and shot in such a proximity that they look very ugly and untouched. Moles, fat hair. Yuk. The bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time either naked or sex. And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. All three characters return to Stephanie's native village, where, through a bunch of flashbacks in the desert countryside and inside predictably dirty, we see little of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. My mother dies. Well ... and that's it, really. The development of the character is kept to a minimum, just like the narrative story. I suppose the story is not linear (it would explain a lot of non sequeliurs), but really, after paying seven euros, I do not feel like I have to build the movie myself: this is the director take the money for me. Expect me to join the narrative process and put my hands dirty, so to speak, I ask too much. This film is a pile of pretentious garbage, made above all by the desire to epater les bourgeois (ie straight shocks). I see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival and see why it did not get anywhere.
