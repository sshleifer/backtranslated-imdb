What were they thinking of "Cannes"? One of the most irritating movies of all time. Every detail of this movie, no matter how meaningless it was, was shown. If I had to watch her put her boots once again, I think I'd have shouted. If the purpose of this movie was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the credits ought to have been broadcast. But no, we had to always see countless redundant scenes. The whole thing was full of unpopular and unsatisfying characters. They deserved the misery that Rosetta was. And to think we've passed "Tumbleweeds" to see this boredom movie. It was like seeing grass growing, but that's more interesting.
