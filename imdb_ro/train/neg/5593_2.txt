I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies since I was younger and I thought it was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if my youth misled me to believe that Lee was the supreme Dracula with style, look, attraction, and the evil beneath it. Or maybe this movie disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with an English snobbish accent and body language to go with her? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic character choices and is boring and does not have any kind of tension ..? Then, this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - you do not see it! I gave him only 2, because I somehow managed to stay awake during the whole movie. Sorry, but if you liked this movie, then you must have been sleepless and alone at home in a dark room with lots of unseen space behind you. Maybe alone in the parents' house or in a foreign house. Because the characters in this movie did not seem afraid, and I think they sum up everything! Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in the history of Dracula's cinema, you may be fascinated by how Dracula's story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because the movie is not so appealing, do not get caught up in the suggestive mystery, which makes my Vampyre so fascinating for me. <br /> <br /> And, in addition, it has so much of that sticky 70ies feel about it. The landscape seems to be the cheap theater. And I'm not saying I reject everything done in the 1970s. Because I can love the old movie as well as new.
