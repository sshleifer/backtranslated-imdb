I'm sure deep in the depths of Jack Blacks, the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious, but it is not. You can tell egg to Jack who has a whale of a while to reconcile him to play a sneaky and slim Mexican man with dreams of becoming a fighter, but this movie is a total rash in almost every department . <br /> <br /> Just stayed there through most of the movie thinking, "That should be funny" and "This is the guy from Tenacious D right?" The truth is that this film does NOT have to offer. NOT AT ALL! It's a terrible scenario with rough characters and really action and direction. You will watch endless moments in which you think something will really be fun, but you simply will not. I was silly bored about 10 minutes, but of course I would have been up. She did not. 90 minutes later, we had barely managed to extinguish an aneurysm, it was painful. It's like remembering a few years ago when you saw something with your favorite actor, even some of them from the beginning before being famous, and you were embarrassed that the actor was actually in such a load of poplar. Yeah, that's right. I enjoyed Jack Black's previous films, like Shallow Hall, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick Destiny, but coming to the man. If you do that to us again, Jack, I'll have to get there and give you a knee or something. At least I'm giving you a serious discussion. I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ...
