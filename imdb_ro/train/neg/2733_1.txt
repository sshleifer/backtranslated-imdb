I debated whether or not I should tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by any Scrubs survivor, it probably does not fall into the category of a spoiler. Grrr. We all know that friends went down when they started with clips ... and five and a half years in Scrubs they left and fell into that hole. I have to wonder if the writers could not be bothered to write this week and they just told them "to show the other fun things." It did not work. To begin with, it shows that all the moments when people have fallen are not fun when they are out of context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging on his banana hammock if we do not know why he's messing up with his banana hammock. Secondly, for what was to be a compilation of JD's fantasies, one was Turk's dream, another was also not his fantasy, though I forgot what. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. I've seen all of these before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. Finally, I must admit that two of my favorite Scrubs have been featured in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realizing that Ben died ... and that JD tells him how proud he is. But even if you see those moments again did not save the episode. The summary says everything. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, Please DO NOT let your show go just like your friends, keep it fresh, keep it fun ... or wrap it up.
