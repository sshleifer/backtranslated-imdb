I paid a dollar for this DVD and at first I felt broken, but then I thought about it and I would be grateful. I found a holy grail, a true foundation stone for bad cinemas. If you think that the dramatic opening kicks of an empty stadium are successful with the Evel room monologue, wait until the opening credits roll down the driver's bottom. Script seems to be glued together from press cuts and ESL textbooks. But ..... I can not believe how bad George Hamilton is. Looks like he has absolutely nothing to do with what he says, the only internal monologue I can detect is, "I bet guys I think I'm cute, very cute!" This is a epiphany! Now I know how bad it can be.
