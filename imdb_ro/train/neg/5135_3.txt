I think scarecrows are terrifying, so it's a shame that this movie does not make much of them. <br /> <br /> A bunch of robbers make an emergency parachute from a plane into an enormous field with scarecrows. One of them vanished with prey, and the others followed him as they were removed by inexplicable scarecrows. The act is hammy and unimpressive scarecrows (when they move). On the positive side, the director does not make any suspense from static scarecrows. It's as Alfred Hitchcock says: "A bomb under the table goes out and is surprising. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it's gone and that's suspense."
