I am amazed to discover the amount of fans this show has. They did not say that friends were, at best, an "average" sitcom, and not as wonderful as others did. Let's face this if it was not about the distribution of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Matt Le Blanc, who knows if this show would have lasted as long as he did. I very much doubt that. Although, as the series progressed, friends became more predictable, more courageous and more boring, that I did not care less about the characters - which are the most exaggerated in the history of television - or about their situation, or about who was sleeping with whom. And it has gone from being fun in the first four seasons to casually funny. And even if all these actors of the Hollywood A-list in the world of cinema had all the time, I did not bother to register myself. Writing in Friends has become eternal that we have lost interest in this show in the sixth season, and in the following, it was very predictable to say the least. What was annoying was that it lasted 10 seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only three, four seasons and were eventually canceled and out of the air forever. The show should have stopped immediately, while the distribution wanted higher salaries. In fact, as much as the series disappeared, the show was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now we are talking about a friends meeting that comes to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I will not expect anything.
