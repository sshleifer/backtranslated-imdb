The unnecessary revolution and can not approach the capture of the original charm. Extreme length causes more than a few induction parts of the crack. This version is fairly politically ridiculous. The film has no style and, moreover, it lacks the talent, not just the act, but the direction, the sets, the costumes, etc. are all under par. She has a blatant doubt about the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only member of the band to show any flair, Tyne Daly is not too bad. He should have left alone enough. The song is good (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (everyone else). Track the original version of 1963 and skip it. It's not much to recommend.
