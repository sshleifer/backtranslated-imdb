this is NOT one of those movies is one of the biggest pieces of clover I've ever excused, the camera job is trying to get brilliant but really just crack everything looks like the red shoes logs but no sex , the only reason I bought this was that I wanted to try the DVD and it was the cheapest one I found, probably the worst purchase in my life and it could have taken you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is REALLY sticky and most of the movie is made up of endless rehearsals of clips from the first two films, why would anyone want to make a film as awful as it is beyond me if be really trying to make an original movie and it would have failed, I'd be nicer in this review, but have no right to reproduce things in the first two and then edit and repeat it in this movie with Approximately about 1 second original film, which is about the standards of film students, DO NOT buy this movie. the only entertainment that this DVD can offer is if you put it in the microwave and watch flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER GARBAGE incredible! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow this.
