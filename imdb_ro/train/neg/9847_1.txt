Peter Sellers interprets Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a chef for a pirate ship who takes the lead after killing the previous one. Although he witnessed a buried treasure, he begins to lose his memory and the treasure map he gets becomes empty. So, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (place an ad for that?) And help guide a path to treasure. It's like someone could have funded this unnecessary movie. The former Goon, Spike Milligan, replaced Medak as a director, and considering Medak's talent in The Ruling Class, you probably guess which of the serious, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a short appearance in the first 10 minutes of the film, as a pirate-led captain. He is probably quite grateful that young Frankenstein was released in the same year, he was filmed and preserved so he could keep it from his resumption. Franciosa looks scary, because the beautiful driver behind Scratcher, but he and the seller look so desperately, even the makeup and the hair of the sellers, which seem pretty terrible. They were supposed to know that this movie was bombed even as they filmed it. With such lines, I understand every possible anxiety: LOAD: (about to be hung) You will pay for it. SCRATCHER: No, T. I'm doing it for free. And that's a good joke. It is amazing to me that much of the prolific material of the vendors is still in the safes, but this has been made available on VHS over 15 years ago! How about someone going to the plate and releasing the British television program "A Show Fred" with Sellers, Milligan and directed by the great Richard Lester?
