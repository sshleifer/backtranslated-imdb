Blades, action superhero action movie. I have had great hopes for this film, and the kind of HK policeman is one that I do not despise, but I rarely see such a strange and ridiculous story as this one. This would have been forgiven, as is always the case in such films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action is about the trademark surreality and the peak character of the HK action, but it is not very involved, gorilla and, in fact, often completely incoherent (perhaps due to the re-issuance of American liberation, showing signs in many mosaic sites) . I was very disappointed.
