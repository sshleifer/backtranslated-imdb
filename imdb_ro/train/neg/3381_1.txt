This may be the worst adaptation of a musical on Broadway ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment of fake ring. I will say, however, that it is bad enough to be funny. The hairstyles are remarkable. I can not understand what is meant (conceptually) for my life by opening the movie with an outside of the A Chorus Line theater. Do we have to believe that these people are heard for "A line of choirs," which contains stories about audiences? No, the show crashes on itself. I saw the original production and listened to the album for hundreds of times. Why, why did they do that?
