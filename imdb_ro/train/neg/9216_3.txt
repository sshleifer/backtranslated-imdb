Hoo boy, it was a real process to get through. The DVD case has Tom Hanks' mug steeped on her and this is the only reason anyone can buy it. It looks like forty on the box, however, the film was made in 1982, so he still has Bosom's friends and, of course, is about forty pounds lighter. The plot refers to Dungeons and Dragons, played by Hanks and his three friends, and Hanks ends up thinking that everything is real. Chris Makepeace is a genius named Jay Jay, and the best thing about the movie is that he's wearing a funny hat of success. Ooh, look, it's got a yellow with a tuxedo! Now he's dressed like a World War I pilot! This was a really terrible movie, but in a bad way. A bunch of vets mostly appear as parents of children. There is Anne (I'm Honey West, Dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually look a little hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has a novelty role as a policeman. Wendy Crewson, is love interest for Hanks and a blonde guy I've never seen before or since. There is inexorable music here and there and absolutely no tension or feeling of danger or emotion. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because it is, I do not know, nuts. The monster is played by the late band, Kevin Peter, by Predator's fame. A friend of mine pulled her out of the trash can at MallWart and advised me to keep him in the trash without looking at him, so of course I had to see if it was so bad all this. Was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, this movie was a bit of shock. Do a favor and leave it in the basket. Yes, after Hanks almost jumps from one of the World Trade Center towers because of his illusions, he goes home to recover and is visited by his friends. Hanks mom, a beer Vera Miles, says he's back pretty, but when he walks down to the lake to visit his tennis equipment, he's more crazy than ever. the end
