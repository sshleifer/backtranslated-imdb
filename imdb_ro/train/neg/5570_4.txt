let's cherish it. Fun: a scrawled scenario that was printed by unintelligent people in front of the writing machines a thousand times. Pathetic action that is hindered by the story ... Value of production OK, set / location and a wonderful girl .. -realization 4 / 10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie does not have a social message. is thought free ... but if I pretend to be 10 years old and my IQ was 70. I feel the message is: do not be afraid to love? - unacceptable things: nothing special, only the hedonistic and slightly arrogant attitude of the Jewish writer / director. Generally speaking, nothing good, nothing degenerate - 8/10 <br /> <br /> is 4/10
