This movie was great! (Not as good as a masterpiece by Leif Garrett Longshot) but still awesome! I thought Ashley looked huge compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought that it would make such places and escape close to it. My dad was a bastard and yet my mother was a little too funny with Helmit's head. I give him 4. Anyone who likes this movie should check the Longshot.
