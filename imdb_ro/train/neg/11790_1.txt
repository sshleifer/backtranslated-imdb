Deep SH .. is more like her! The eels are just cartooned over the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets Leviathan. Very sticky. No character or relationship development. So-called "romantic" scenes very horn and predictable. An interesting idea, but a badly written script and special LOUSY effects make this a must-miss!
