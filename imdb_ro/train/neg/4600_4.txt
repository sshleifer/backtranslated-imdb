I've read all these reviews here about how this movie is so good. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. The actress was over most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I have not seen a more pathetic attempt to make someone "bad" in a movie. Oh, man, this movie was a letdown. I also read somewhere where there might be a classic cult. I know there are adherents of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. The script was blades, for the most part the act was blades, this film was blades. > <br /> Oh, and pray the guy who had been in Smiles. It looks very bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the type of Office Space, and he was just in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
