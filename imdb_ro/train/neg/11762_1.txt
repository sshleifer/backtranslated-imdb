As a South African, it is an insult to believe that someone has actually been paid to produce this nonsense! Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "plus" to the series is terrible! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played an important role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. The film, however, is nothing but a hunter scrawled from the bottom of a drum by a writer who has failed to impress from the mid-nineties. While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, saving drowning slaves with his red buoy and smoldering smile? <br /> <br /> I've always waited for the blond and busty women to get out of nowhere and run on the screen in their red bathing suits for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been more bizarre than the fancy line of the plot, which was probably dreamed after 10 beer puffs on a fancy costume, where a cavalry costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for the next "blockbuster."
