Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a sacrifice of what might have been an interesting plot? At least, if I can warn others, it will be worth it. I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of things and would have been clear. The film was slow, had a minor character development, and centered around the idea that a white scary man could become cool if he came out with a black LA man. experience the stereotypical feeling of LA of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Keep in mind, however, that this film does not explain what we have come to think of a "LA lifestyle" is a wonderful example of the products that come from it.
