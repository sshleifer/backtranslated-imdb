This movie should be called "Joseph Smith's Plan 9". I think his curiosity is under-appreciated. the playwright seems to have read the "Population Bomb" (1968) by Paul Ehrlich "and made a musical response especially for Mormons. The whole point of the play is that having as many children as part of the" heavenly father " (God), and everything that stands in the way of having more children is very bad Take it This version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing it is utah so it looks and feels like 1983, the play was written in 1973, and of course, theology is part of the 1840 band, part of the battlestar galactica, part of the action takes place on the earth, and others in pre-existence, an endless dream room where annoying children wait to take their bodies for them to come down to try not to break down the missionaries door, losing their fire to heaven's glory. It's just as scenic as they do, but do not let poor theaters ruin your appreciation for this mormon universe dement, where the "bad" children are all in control of the population, (probably) advising their parents not to have children, , at the time the piece was written, the cultural norm in the ld community and, more importantly, was considered part of God's plan. family planning has made a choice of parents, and large families are far less cultural norms now, making the whole doctrinal premise of the film for a modern day mormon! as well as music, there are some attractive songs here that simply will not let this film die of death in the 1970s was pre-destined. brother and sister are singing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if anything else can happen there. and tough and bad kids make the new kids on the block look like metallic. so all the blessings! Gather the family around, make some jello-o shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
