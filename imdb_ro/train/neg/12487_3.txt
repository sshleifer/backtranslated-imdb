This movie was a great disappointment. I take the opposite view of critics. This is not a case in which the material does not rise at the actors level; here actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not at the material level. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney and watched how One Night happened - a classic all the time. With a very similar story, Davis proves she does not have the talent for comedy (good for her, it's the only comedy she's ever tried!) Davis's performance, which happened one night. Cagney, who was a great comedian, seems to be out of sync with his costume, Davis. The script offers some decent lines and gags, but delivery seems more suited to drama than comedy. Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more like a light drama than a comedy. Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has manipulated much more similar material. In a rather typical role, Eugene Palette offers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role, like an old old relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of the poorest performances, William Frawley is quite irritating. The constant repercussions of his character on fictitious policemen are a poor irony effort. I really like each of these artists, and it's a shame that, as a whole, they fail to get any chemistry and no better results than "The Bride Came C.O.D.
