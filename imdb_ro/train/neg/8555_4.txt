This is a very old and cheap movie made - a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film reminds a lot of John Wayne's early films, which were made for the studios of "poverty." With both actors, their familiar style and personality were not yet fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not look exactly like the Cooper just a few years later (he speaks faster in this early film, among others). However, unlike the B movie, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you want to see the woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, that's your chance. Lili Damita plays the role of female love and this is a very strange casting choice with a hard focus (it was French) and it was not even close to being the "beautiful star movie". Actually, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and strange aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subapot - something like a MOUNTAIN BROKEBACK from the 1930s (and I thought this was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character has been raised by two men who hate women and do their best, through many films, to keep Cooper away from women. This misogynism does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that the filmmakers were trying to portray them as a gay couple. Especially to the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and stops dying long enough to crawl to the body of his fallen friend and then falls off with his arms around him! This has been quite edgy for the time and I think this makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As for Cooper and the plot goes, the movie is a bit of a disappointment and very jumping. If you are not curious about Damita or homosexual subton, do yourself a favor and find a better West.
