It's one of those stereotypical-generation dance films of generation, and I do not see where all these garbage can come from. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same story as all the other "dancing" movies there. It's terrible! The name should scream not to look. "How it moves." Since when do film titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had decent dance scenes, but they do not even deserve a watch. I give it 1 out of 10, just because there is zero. I'm begging someone with an IQ for over 60 years not to look at it and not to waste your money. 1.6 / 10 should tell her everything. This movie should not even be done.
