I gave this 2-star movie just because Dominic Monaghan actually put an effort into acting. Everything about this movie is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only does the director have to rethink what he's doing for a life career, but maybe he should watch some movies. Because Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a movie of this caliber makes it terrible. Someone "actor" was the one who played Jack's best friend should never have walked in front of the room. I did not expect too much from such a small film, but perhaps it should have been a little more time and effort in the characters and their surroundings. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as we did), you will be very disappointed.
