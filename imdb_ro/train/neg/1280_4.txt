When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "Harvey Girls". Is not. It's a pudding that overlaps, hits the kitchen ceiling and rolls. No music, not a piece of the epoch, but very unlikely. He begins with Patriarch James Woods telling her the biggest of her three daughters, a young child who becomes Barbara Stanwyck, that she must maintain her surname and home. So we believe it will be a historical story among the generations. And it is, for a short period of time. Then it turns into the story of Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is he so dead against him? Why else? While studying in a strange retrospective story told by Stanwyck, she once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters, as well as for herself, of course) through marriage. She hit someone she took to be a country bumpkin, who was in fact a Brent lawyer. <br /> <br /> Does not anyone think that the child they had, a young man eight times at the time of the main plot, is - well, you know ... They had a hurried marriage and in very short time they was together, was conceived. One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young. The other sister is trying to take him. Etc., etc. It is a strident, incessant mess - well-done, but without any logic or plausibility.
