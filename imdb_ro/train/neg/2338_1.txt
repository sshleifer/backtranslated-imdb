How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminds us of the resemblance to the better Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some Congo Express characters who got together without a relationship: Jean, the Congolees, the laborer, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was not. This should not be a reason to forgive the flaws in the scenario (if there is a script) of Whatever wind blows. The joke in the fridge is taken from that great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte puts too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents occur in the movie, but no explanation comes after. Tom Barman gives us a movie that's more like an experiment to watch TV than a movie for theaters. Another chance missed for the Flemish cinema.
