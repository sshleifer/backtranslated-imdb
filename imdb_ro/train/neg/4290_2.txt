I will give this movie two stars, because it looks like a beautiful photo. Otherwise, it happens mainly with clich√©s and stereotypes: mountain people are either racist, religious or racist white garbage, or white wise Indians. Indians are magical people who move without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to the animals, and read the minds over long distances. And so and so on. Throughout the movie, I wondered what was the point of the film (other than showing me beautiful pictures of mountains, wooden cabins, wood, a range of animals, living mountain residents and strange people in the church). Pleasure has touched a whole range of problems, but has not explored anyone in-depth. This was no story about growing during depression, nor about being an orphan, nor about a fight for identity. He tried to make all these things even more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory. Although the film was supposed to be about Little Tree Education, we do not learn anything about it. He received a short summary of his people's history (which was courageous and stoic) and a demonstration of the distillery; tried his hand to cut wood (which he failed) and whiskey (literally); she learned to read (and write) with her grandmother and the dictionary - and that was it. It seems he did not learn too much during his internment meeting because he was locked in the attic. However, her grandmother and grandfather and Graham Greene's character ensured that eventually Little Tree became a very spiritual person, whose main purpose as an adult, then paraphrasing here, "riding with Navajos" and "caught in a few wars ", was" caught "with his grandfather and grandfather and Graham Greene's character in the sky (instead of girls, getting married, marrying, having children or other such nonsense). Last but not least, I have to say that I found the grandfather's commercial offensive. Why of all things had to be a whiskey yet? To counter the stereotype of the "drunk Indian"?
