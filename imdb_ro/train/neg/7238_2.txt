Interaction between characters is a moral disaster. You will end up dislike most of the characters and you do not really like either of them. Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you do not care about them at all. The film has no plot, no direction, no purpose. The only way to redeem the movie was to treat him as a look in the tangled life of a few losers - and that does not even stimulate an even loss of afternoon.
