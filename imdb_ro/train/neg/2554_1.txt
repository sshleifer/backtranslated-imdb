Frankly, I do not even joke when I say this is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen! This film does not have a single ounce of originality in its thin dialogue or its story line of facts. We can not even start counting the number of things in this movie, which are obviously torn from "The Omen" and other movies like her. For example, the "Lucy" grandfather of this film is, in fact, one of the devil servants sent to guide and protect Satan's fear ... ... sounds much like Mrs. Baylock for anyone else. Another thing is that the orphanage was the one who took the first child burned to the ground just a few months after being adopted, as in "The Omen." However, fortunately, a priest survived the flame and escaped with severe burns all over his body ... yet another coincidence ?????? And to the end, the burnt priest is in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the wall, just like the priest in the "Omen," with pages of the Bible plastered on walls like wall paper. Please do not even start drawing any comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you because, as I said above, there is too much to mention here.
