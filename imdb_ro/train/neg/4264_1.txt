this film has left me decisively. was a great concept that was ruined by a horrible scenario. The story just has not passed and was split at best. There have been so many elements of this story that have not been explained, or have been forced into their place without any real thought. elements such as the love story could have been extended a little longer, and cannons have to be written better. the entire main character who grew up needed more for the training he had received and less so. everyone likes a good "little guy overcomes" story and this has shown promise, but with scripting failures it was not to be. Although he had some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence, he lacked choreography. this made for a boring boring clock <br /> <br /> could have been so good :(
