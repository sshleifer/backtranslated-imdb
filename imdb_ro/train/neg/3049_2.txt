Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So soft and unpredictable. The previous films have tried to pay for the holiday spirit, the most notable "Santa Claus conquers the Martians", at least it was fun to watch because of the campaign to her and all the film materials used ... for some reason, mi he seemed happy. But this film just screws Christmas on the bottom and screws the joy of all the kids. Santa is living in space? Is his enemy a devil named Pitch? Santa Helps Merlin the Magician? How random is this? Since it's been done in Mexico, then some of you could understand how the movie was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just annoying for time. It was a complete cluster of madness! Although, despite all the problems with the film, he still feels a Christmas movie. The good conquers evil, and Christmas still plays some of the hearts of every good girl or boy in the world or possibly the universe, because Santa Claus conquers Martians apparently. So I think you should try, even if this is one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... though you should smile on your face every day.
