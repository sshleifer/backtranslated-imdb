Although not offensive, the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is certainly moronic. The title might lead you to wait for a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in the silent episode of 1914), but that would be better served by the 1947 version of Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of Elvis' films. The worst of all is not a mixture of these, but rather as someone scotch-glued together segments of each, so things bounce back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < you Mandy Moore playing against Dan Quayle). Austin would later play alongside John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade," with the talent disparity between them, in fact, painful to watch. In the mid-1960s, she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, so she was presented in a similar series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue suit. When the car maker's advertising agency replaced her with the "Dodge Fever" girl, someone had the enlightened idea of ​​presenting her in a feature film. <br /> <br /> What story here goes with Pauline growing up in the Baskerville Foundling house led by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. on "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline - not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotaging more opportunities she has to take. George leaves for his fortune, and Pauline, 19, receives a job by directing a wealthy Middle East oil tanker. When she tries to add the attractive blonde to the harem, she runs away from danger to danger. These include the African pyramids, a 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze it until his one-year-old nephew is old enough for marriage, the film industry, and the Russian space program. destined to be silly and charming, but only manages the stupid side. Efforts are made to incorporate a silent movie into sequences of action, simulating distortion of a camera (which speeds up action). Unfortunately, everything else (film stock, production design, editing) is depressing in the 1960s. Nothing here comes close to Pearl White's images of a diary that goes to a clatter or railroad waiting for the train which is approaching. Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
