SPEAKING MEETING: Gettaway is mostly a action movie. And what action do you have to do? Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. It's about Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy's. This is a remake and I did not see the original, but it did not really care, though Bassenger and Baldwin have a beautiful chemistry screen. But the movie itself did not do it to me. Gettaway has become very tiring indeed very quickly. The terrain is shadowed by a fight / pursuit after another and as violence continues to get involved, Bassenger and Baldwin keep their marvelous looks, no matter what dangers they can have. Actually, by the end of the movie almost looks better then started. I do not think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once in the whole picture. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it's not very good and if it's not one action movie purist I really can not really enjoy this movie because it's not too there are many here. Gettaway is not far from original, and goes in all directions, from brutally useless to rather boring. It may have been really better. I think Bassenger and Baldwin are performing well, but they do not have much to do but watch and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again becomes obsolete. He did not enjoy too much of this.
