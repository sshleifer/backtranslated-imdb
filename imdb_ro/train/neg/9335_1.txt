The reason why this movie is so bad is that it's so badly written, and that's entirely the fault of novelist hacker Robert James Waller, author of Bridges of Madison County. Writing is bad because the plot is perfectly tricked and the dialogue is wood and unlikely. A young man who has failed to master a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of being ashamed is swept away by a powerful, self-directed criminal and after some adventures (especially terribly violent) alternating with scenes shows the hotter part of the assassin, leaves the impotent partner of the murderer who, as bad as he is, sees it more clearly than anyone else has before. Nothing can help this film to succeed, not even Scott Glenn's stingy face as a murderer, not Giovanna Zacar√≠as's appealing latinity as Luz, and even Harvey Keitel's performance as a CIA specialist designated to follow the murderer. A serious waste of time.
