The premise of the movie is scary: a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar. But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a Sci-Fi C movie. It's a great Star Trek and a bit of X files, but more than anything else is boring. When the movie hit them in action, everything is predictable and a cliche. It looked more like a ground floor in a serious series of Sci-Fi television. Without suspense and emotion, but not for a lack of test. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. Do not waste time.
