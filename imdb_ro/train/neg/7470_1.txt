In SÃ£o Paulo, senior middle-aged Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel just joined the university, and on the eve of the opening class, they go to a drug and drink party. The next day, after their hours, Cristiano's date the night before comes to his house and his three friends are violating their girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother gets, scares Gabriel and turns the ladder, breaking his neck. The trio decides to throw and burn the bodies in a landfill, but other tragedies occur during the night. "Cama de Gato" polemic and shameful is a pretentious overvalued stupidity about the alienation of young people, and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie I have seen over the years. The superficial, tragic and dark story is actually a comedy of black humor of bad taste. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and stupid stories, with interviews with teenage monsters at first and finally. The act is terrible, apparently with many improvisations but without talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of Caio Blat promising in this garbage. The camera, the framing, the cinema and the edition are amateurish and of a very low quality. The sound is terrible, and in many ways it is impossible to understand what actors and actresses are saying (probably a plus, since this film sucks). The bandwidth is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre film in a very poor sexual exploitation market. My vote is one (terrible). Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat litter")
