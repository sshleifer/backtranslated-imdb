This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. Not just the story, but the act is shockingly bad. Dialogue sounds like someone reading the news. This is rated as comedy / drama / romance, it's not one of those things! It's a small action, that's all. It's not a comedy and drama at all. If you went to the cinema to see this, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend at all. Quite a lot else you choose to look at will be better. This is just a movie of action / crime. The action scenes have been subjected, and the story of the crime was very predictable. If you are not really interested in a good story or a good adventure. And you just want to look at a "stranger" movie for calling to be a stranger. Then it could be for you.
