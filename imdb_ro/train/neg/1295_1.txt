this is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese films and I think another film by the same director, the 80,000 v electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the story was extremely appealing. but I could not find anything fun about it. It takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects the director used - such as constant percussion and the exorbitant use of the slow motion - only brought about my growing anger that the story was so slow, and the actors have survived fiercely. a lot of boredom was the result of some foreign additions that were totally useless - like an hour spent at Asano, rolling around Buddha statues and proclaiming how nothing worshiped. this did not add anything to the plot. a Japanese filmmaker and I have been both checking the time constantly. we could not believe that this movie was just as terrible as it was. and the end was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for doing this, but unfortunately I was wrong.
