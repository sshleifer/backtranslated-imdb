The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical part of the film is pretty fine, even its direction. The main problem is cast pieces, which turned the film into another local and regular clich√©, with a great lack of impact and a greater lack of impression. Apart from the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all the other actors, unfortunately, were not the best. The role of the blind-eyed girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh, but with no intensity, as the main role. therefore, the figure he acted on became gentle and low. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal, then a real movie. But, after all, it is a good starting point and great improvement in the future.
