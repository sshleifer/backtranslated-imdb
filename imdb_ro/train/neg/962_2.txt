The chances are if I once again looked at it that I might get physically ill, the movie is so annoying ... if you do not believe in psychic, reincarnation and the other hocus-pocus that this it promotes it over time. "Re-cycling souls," they call it here. Puh-Leeza. This story has been made several times before with movies like "Heaven Can Wait". It has also been done much better. Too bad they had to lose the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it's a very popular film of language. This is the only quality of redemption of this film.
