We need to ask whether at any time in the production of this movie there was a script that made sense. Has it been cut roughly for 3 hours and cut into the incoherent dirt that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone fund this misery? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good young man and that he does what he can with dialogue and dramatic situations (?) In which he is given. But the characters come and go without apparent reason, continuity is nonexistent, and cinema, cinema and direction are (to be polite) amateur. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate choice for the title because it will probably be untrue if someone tries to actually see the movie.
