This clogged melodrama is pretty easy the worst film with Ingrid Bergman I've seen. Even the presence of the luminous screen can not save this inadequately slow and meandering film, which is almost impossible to sit without sending too fast. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> Just for Bergman fans, others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you look instead of "Who's calling the heel"?
