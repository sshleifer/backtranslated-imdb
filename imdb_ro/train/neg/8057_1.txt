What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. Editing tries too much to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer, while giving him a strong headache. The land is tangled and obviously prolonged from what began as a short (story or film). The film does just for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched painfully until it reaches the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what's going on with things when we stretch them, right? Exact. They become thinner. Eventually, the plot is just so thin that you can lose it even if you do not pay attention, which is hard to do when you watch this movie. The actor is not even impressive. Characters are badly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that are wrong with this movie is that, apparently, anyone who took care of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it should be (not that I blame it on it, it does not matter either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not suit scenes at all. Also, what was all the sexual subtleties between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, this was in order to attract young men, but it was so cheaply made. And the first scene is related to the rest of the movie? Any level imaginable? Not at all? The two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the movie, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt that someone will really enjoy a movie so badly put together and a similar Hollywood-like attempt to such an idea, dishonest and terrible, to some sort of interesting idea. But I can handle it. I recommend this to teenagers with low attention that does not bother a horror thriller very bad as long as there is sex and gore in it (although this can only be true for the Killer Cut, which I have seen). 1/10
