I have seen this recently and I must say that I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not work enough. However, I look forward to looking at the documentary produced by the producers who organized this project, because I think it would be more compelling work than this film. but their action was right and we must mention a young actress who played Holly. This was her first film role and she did a very nice job, considering she was the most challenging part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was suited but weak as Patrick, the American whose mission is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good in this final role. Unfortunately, despite my extremely favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both actors were very forgetful and did not do the best work in this film. I believe in the message and the intention of the film, but I have to be fair, so I write 3 star "Holly" on the basis of its film deficiencies. But I think the subject has been earnest and I am pleased that the people behind this film also made a documentary, hoping to have their debut on the BBC and other TV networks.
