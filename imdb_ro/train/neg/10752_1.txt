This movie was so disappointing. From the gentleness that made me decide to see Love Ghost (why is this called?) I was expecting something artistic and careful with beautiful pictures. He had some interesting pictures, but they seemed often random and they did not make sense. In fact, they seemed to have been inserted to fill the time. Finally, the effect was unclear. I think the movie was meant to be atmospheric, but it just was not. The lack of a coherent plot did not help things. It could be said to have been mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent, with no atmosphere. The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot did not attract me enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the distribution list, I would not have known you were seeing the main character as a child. The film has a very small context for time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but sex scenes (there were more) seemed useless and mistaken for me, I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure if he was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or her she was a prostitute. Only when I saw the credits I discovered, the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover. This film has managed to do what she should have shocked (dream sequences involving Lulu's mother) seems a bit boring. Nail deposition actually made more sense because it gave some indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors for not having much to do. I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to inattitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. I can not be bothered to talk about it.
