If you follow this without suggesting what the story is, then you are in surprise. Even then, the synopsis painted a picture of a rather sane story, but the real movie is nothing but. As it is synopsis, it is said of a climbing hill climbing mountain, where you will see a prologue in front of opening credits and textual access to the text that tells you about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in wonderful manuscripts of the mind (notes to himself, problems with intermittent lights) where his inhabitants are immortal who want a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world and see this mountain climber all the people, and the Synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating a smart sphere to meet with man. What he translated is a repetitive animation piece that a 5-year-old child can produce. Forms have been created, although credit is heading towards the stop motion style and puts it in a loophole. And repeat until the eyes begin to close, then go to the next scene. Chonopolisians (if there is this term) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing the belief of that magical sphere and having a field day with it before releasing it into the world of "others." It also does not do better when man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotic and sleep induction sequence. <br /> <br /> Thank you, of course, that running time is shorter than what is announced, which means 57 minutes (or less) than those mentioned. While she was firmly dated, her dull colors, the non-existent story, the stinging soundtrack, and the repetitive images will not win any fan. Do not lose time.
