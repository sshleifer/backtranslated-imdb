Where to start? The best way to describe how terrible this movie is? <br /> <br /> Let's start with humor campy hick. It's not very funny. Add a bunch of musicians mating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Poor stone Art Carney, who ought to know better than to make this film. And then there is the plot. A roadie whose life purpose is to work on a show Alice Cooper meets a girl whose life purpose is to be a group for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... And then, even when the movie should end, I can not come up with a more plausible scene than a ... well, I will not ruin for you if you really want to see the movie. There are some actors who announce that it will be a "B" movie or maybe even worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. This is a sure sign that the movie will probably not be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - it even exceeds them by being worse than the poor. Let's just say that. This is the film against which all the bad movies are compared. And none is worse than Roadie.
