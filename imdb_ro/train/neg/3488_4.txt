Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration? Answer: Turning it into a parable of existential alienation. Yes, we returned in the early 1990s, right after the disintegration of the eastern bloc and the subsequent floods of immigrants into the European Union, and what better way to approach the subject than to make a film about a middle-class journalist alienated an existential alien politician, his existentially rooted wife, and so on. , immigrants call for political asylum in an anonymous Greek village near the border. I think Angelopoulos can manifest a social consciousness while dealing with the higher classes in existential difficulty. I want to say honestly, the scene in which an army senior officer curses his destiny because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you bloody. Anyway, it can not be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of cinematic art, is not it? Wrong. At this point, his manners are becoming too artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual troops show: there are blurred windows, faded lights, a strange wedding, a ride on the river bank, and people with yellow water. Also, Mastroianni breaks the ground for the highest somnamest performance ever. Avoid it indeed. Go for his first movies.
