I recently watched this movie with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performance. I'm a person I call barbaric culture. I hate art in any form or form. Rambo is more of my film, action, kill, blood, horror. If you admire this case, avoid this movie like plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing like that. Let me give you a summary in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes in Nazi black and white propaganda. Every Italian in a block of flats attends a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of a housewife, an anti-fascist, and a caretaker. The housewife deceived by her husband meets the anti-fascist. He falls in love with him, wants to make love with him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they make love to each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her homosexual lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. Do you want a brief summary? Dressing ... Pretty short? The guy should have used his gun at the beginning of this movie and shot himself to save the audience from this atrocity. On a side note, my sister loved this movie. As I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
