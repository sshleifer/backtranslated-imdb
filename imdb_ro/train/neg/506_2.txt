(aka: Bloodsucker leads the dance) A lot of babes naked in this movie with some lesbo scenes thrown in. The film should take place in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic Lesbians are invited to Conte's castle for the weekend. One by one they seem to miss their heads because of a crazy run around. It is not very scary or bloody, and the rooms look as if they are lit by the spotlight even if the candles are lit. Go figure ... (sic) Dabbing is worse than usual, and the plot serves only as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by Alfredo Rizzo, the euro horror actor, this is a snoozer. Pretty boring 2 out of 10
