When you look at this now and hear all the languages ​​here, it's amazing that the PG was rated, but that's the 1970 rating system for you. Peter Falk bursts the name of the Lord in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! However, few people find it offensive and certainly not scumbags doing movies, nor the people who "miss" them. Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands, and Paul Sorvino are not really actors you did not find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist films and many films by director William Friedkin, but this script does not offer and feels too much of "seventy years", visible and audible. For those who liked Falk in "Columbo", he must come as a shock to hear him and use as much profanity as in the movie. This is far from the only case.
