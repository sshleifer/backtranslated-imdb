Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) transforms Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) singer into a singing star overnight. Star Esther rises while John goes down, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-desert-highway. The best thing about this movie is music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand plays well, but you can not take it seriously like a star up when she is * already * a star. The first time he appears, singing in a bar in the back, looks like an established star singing for the night, not as an unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. He's too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page in "Living Living," not a hole apartment in the wall, where a real singer would be fighting. Kris Kristofferson deals with ego-centered, out-of-control rock role as ... well, like a singer who tries to be an actor but has not much acting talent. Direction is narrow, the story is slow and boring. But the worst thing about this film is not the direction that works, the direction of the blade or the slow story. It's hair! After looking at Kristofferson and Streisand's 70-year-old haircut, your eyes hurt.
