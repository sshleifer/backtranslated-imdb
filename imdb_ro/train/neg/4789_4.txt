The "Phantasm" of 1979 was a terrible, terrifying, scary and very original shooting, and in a word, cult. The first sequel in 1988 was full of action, action-packed and fun-filled bullets. After the first sequel, however, the creator "Phantasm", Don Coscarelly, had no new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" in 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is quite fun, but there is no originality, and the desperate attempts to bring something new are sometimes tiring, which makes it quite disappointing in compared to its predecessors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the beginning, we are secretly placed behind the mysterious sentinel sphere (silver balls that suck the brain). Then a number of unnecessary and annoying characters (such as Tim, a small "Home Alone" child who happens to be great at shooting, a black chick with a hard and nunchaku) are introduced. The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again cool as a guitar with pony, guitarist Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite creepy as a tall man, but the fact that Tall Man speaks much more in this movie makes him lose some of his humiliations. Mike's character is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he was replaced by James LeGros in part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make a big difference. Gore also keeps the movie interesting, but it is still a disappointment, especially since attempts to compensate for the lack of ideas become annoying quickly. All things considered "Phantasm III" is a waste of acceptable time, but it is certainly disappointing compared to its predecessors. The fans of the first two Phantasm films can try, but I recommend you do not expect too much.
