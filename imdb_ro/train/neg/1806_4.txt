Antonioni's films have not aged well. What always surprises me is that, besides an undeniable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "evil capitalist" who wants to sing it at "La notte", or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting on the train in "La adventure", or Ferzetti quitting the ink cup at the end of the same movie. <br /> <br /> We reviewed yesterday Zabriskie Point. There are many beautiful and elaborate photos of Rod Taylor, LA streets and motorways, advertising, desserts, and more. which shows the author's fascination with his American trip, in the same way as Wim Wenders later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-left clips that destroy the movie: - the boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane, and flies over the desert to release himself and find "something different." - Executives in gray flats are talking about speculation all the time. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - The middle-class couple in the caravan speaks in front of the beauty of nature to build a hotel and earn a lot of money. - Last but not least, a lot of couples who love in the desert. What is a hippy platitude! Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked and his films (except "Le amiche" "Il grido") are just a handful of aesthetics and places common.
