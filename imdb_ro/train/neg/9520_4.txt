[*** POSIBILE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this movie preceded it, so it was anticipated that I sat down to see him in the mailbox on the TCM. What a major disappointment. The distribution is superb, and production values ​​are of prime importance, but the characters are deeper, the plot is thin and everything goes too much. For a movie that addresses alcoholism, family divisions, unbelief, gambling, and sexual repression, the film is curiously full, pro-physical, lifeless and cliché. An example is the false representation of Frank Hirsch: his rather cumbersome request to his wife to "climb up and relax a little," followed by a predictable plea of ​​headaches, leading even more predictably to a nightclub with the secretary ("hey Nancy, I have blues tonight, let's go down a road"), all in accordance with the well-used formula. We do not think these are real people, but cardboard cuts that act in a puppet play. Also, the source of obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with Gwen again / repeatedly is inexplicable because of his fatal inability to keep up or down the pot. The next marriage of desperation to Shirley Maclaine / Ginny's character is, anyway, the moment she was presented to this viewer, clearly condemned to failure, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap - that it could be solved just someone killed. The moment the jealous lover began to run with the gun, I started making a bet with me about whom - Dave or Ginny - would have killed. Everything was fake with a capital "P". <br /> <br /> After saying that, Maclaine's and Dean Martin's performance are here. But overall, it seems to me that the interest of the film is just that of a Hollywood history.
