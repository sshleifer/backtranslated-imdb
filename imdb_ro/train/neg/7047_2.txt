Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor plays the main role you thought poster. Their roles are, in fact, minor. The film is shooting badly between an exaggerated comedy and a realistic drama without even being hired. Especially it seems to me impossible to get much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his screwed friends and sex-loving fianc√©. The terrain is terrible, and I deactivated this after about 2/3 - unusual for me, because I like to finish what I'm starting with. Setting good and beautiful frame takes from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
