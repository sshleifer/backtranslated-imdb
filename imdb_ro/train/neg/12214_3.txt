Well, what can I say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes about what typical racial characters would do in their role. Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to move on, the white guy with the Asian culture chooses to leave the world behind for the yellow country and "maintain a real" black cab driver. In addition, all coke, placing shanghai tang and dunkin donuts was a bit too obvious. The story itself was fun, but pretty much how I thought the story would come off. Then again when watching romantic comedies you can not expect much, but again I just wanted to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of filming.
