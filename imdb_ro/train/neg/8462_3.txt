"Bullfighter" was produced in 2000 but is released on video 5 years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: the confusing story, the incomprehensible dialogue said by Oliver Martinez and the annoying editing? Must be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) go on a mysterious journey. They encounter a lot of terrible characters and they also avoid some bad ones. The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to subtle, do not draw attention to them, with unplanned parcel developments, and weak special effects. Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes at most.
