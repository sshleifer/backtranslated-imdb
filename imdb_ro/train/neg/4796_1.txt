I love John Saxon in everything he is. Once he takes over the camera, though he leads a movie that should have been better called "Do not forget this movie called: Zombie Death House." The 1000 USD Shock Insurance Certificate is Fred Olen Ray's love of making you spend $ 14 in a filmed deposit produced by a major 70-year-old cheese legend. Ray being the frontman at RetroMedia. Ray of the way Charles Band makes it look louder than the stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon. Only now bad, both - and boring next to this. It's great that Ray digs those old stuff, and in some cases, it's the public domain like the rest of the dollar filming, but in the Zombie death house - (the word "Zombie" overlapped to add ownership and interest from FOR) the way to do this is to release it on the dollar market for the clean collector and SAXON fans! If you want to see the real Saxon, pick up black Christmas, nightmare on Elm street or glove.
