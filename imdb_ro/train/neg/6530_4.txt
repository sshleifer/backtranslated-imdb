** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** Gerald Mohr, a B movie actor busy in the 1940s and '50s, heads an expedition on Mars. Before we get to Red Planet, we are amused by a romantic between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the look of Les Tremayne as another scientist who had a goat's beard. Does the Martian exterior have fake backgrounds and shades ranging from red to pink? - the "Cinemagic" process that appears in ads. Sexy real monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized Venus Fly-Trap and an unforgettable rat / spider. The whole bizarre adventure is recalled by surviving Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. ROSU PLANET ANGRY, in his opinion, has enough culture and probably brought most of his followers during Psychedelic's Sixties.
