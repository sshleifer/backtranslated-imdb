You have been beaten and beaten in obedience by my harsh assertions about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals"! Now comes another race in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies! Many of the things I have seen before and let me tell you are not all that are broken to be! Typically, they do not stay at the limit. This, among all others, does not suffer from originality! What is a ninja about preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And that should not be a "martial arts" movie? Does it have a lot of gun shots as an incredible action movie for you? Is blood the first reason to love this until death? Will you lose some of the money you earn hard on a lady who sings in front of her? The answers to these important questions are found in the NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For more fun ninja nonsense, try to check out Godfrey Ho's films from Trans World. Get what you deserve and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
