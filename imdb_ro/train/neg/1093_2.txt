Kitten Natividad, from the famous film, Russ Meyer, plays the role of Chastity Knott, a woman who has found breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get some special fruits (Crockazilla?) Which should have healing powers. After falling on some fruit (which seems to be plastic bananas on the stems) chastity is endowed with some mystical magic powers that make it a superhero, especially The Double D Avenger. Note that he also wears a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, it sounds pretty good. In execution, well, it leaves more than a little desirable. It seems Chastity has a pub and a local gang is angry because he took the business, so some of the strippers (including Haji, also from Russ Meyer's film fame) go after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity fights back into Double D Avenger's mask. Watch her turn a "Wonder Woman" to change her costume and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. The jokes of jokes and the dubious enemies flew as if they were not there tomorrow. With the unmatched thematic song that plays over and over, it comes as a 70-year-old "act of action action" with adult content, although while this is not being evaluated, it would probably could get rid of PG-13 in the worst case. And it is probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan's films look great in comparison. Special aspect by Forest J. Ackerman, but so. Very stupid and I do not buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
