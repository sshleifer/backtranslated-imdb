I will never forget the spirit and great comedy of ORIGINAL Vacation! The lines, rhythm and timing of the events in this movie are remarkable! However, this continuation of the European holiday is a major disappointment. In this sequel, Griswalds wins a European holiday on a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the movie are a little more than light, "ha ha" laughs. For example, a flight attendant on a plane asks Clark: "Want to swim in Can?" Clark answers back, "No, I'll have it here." It's the only line that's funny in this movie. The humor of the European holiday is tense. As if the writers had borrowed all the jokes from the first film, they tried to rebalance a previously made scenario and relied on a ridiculous predatory hit scenario to the end of the picture, just to kill time. /> <br /> Worse, comic novel novels such as Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original children who played Rusty and Audrey since the first film so well are not where to find. Their replacements are not funny, they can not act and show that they go through the movements most of the time. There are also some brutal sex jokes and comments that not only are not funny, they are tasteful. Griswald should have stayed in Wally World. The place where they made legends! Do not join in this terrible adventure of Europe. Viewers should re-watch the Original Vacation Movie instead of this! You will be glad you did.
