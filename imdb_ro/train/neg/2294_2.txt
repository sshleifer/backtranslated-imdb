Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing Scott Hastings' role in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this movie is very easy to understand or even ugly, but Mercurio's leadership is a kind of person you prefer to ignore - completely unlimited and bearing OVERALLS. Big mistake in the costume design, that.
