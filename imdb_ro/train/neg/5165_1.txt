I look forward to this journey, and it was horribly disappointed. And I am very slightly amused at roller coaster and amusement park walks. Roller coaster part was just fine - and that was about 30 seconds of a 90-second journey. <br /> <br /> It was boring visually and badly executed. <br /> <br /> It was the desperate attempt to be like a mix of superior superiors Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland, and failed in every aspect. It was not thrilling or exciting at least.
