Who could have wanted a sequel to legendary Bert I. Gordon's garbage "Food of the Gods"? Nobody, of course, but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea, anyway, and put together a late sequel, which is one of the smallest movies in horror history. "Gnaw" is just a sequel to the name because the setting moved to a typical location at the end of the 80's (a university campus) and also the cheap and cheesy gore effects illustrate perfectly the 1980s. This script blocks with clich√©s, with terrible written dialogues and compiles situations that are not so subtracted from other horror classics (and more successful). Neil Hamilton is a good shoe scientist who performs experiments on routine rodents to do his best to the scientist. Thanks to incredibly stupid animal rights activists, giant and ravenous rats escape and devour almost everyone on campus. Following the old tradition of Spielberg's "Jaws", there is a disgusting dean who refuses to recognize the problem even though heavily mutilated bodies are coming back everywhere. During a grotesque hysterical climax, the rats invoke the opening ceremony of the new sports complex of the campus! "Gnaw: Food of the Gods 2" is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch! Characters do and say stupid things unimaginable (such as going down into unarmed canals while they know they are infested with rats), action is atrocious and there is a really bizarre sequence involving the sex hero under the influence of growth serum! I wonder what Freud's theory about it! Is there a satisfactory amount of gore and sleaze? should be said? music is surprisingly atmospheric. If you fail to get enough of this junk, there are plenty of creatures spinning on moving rats, such as the hip movie "Rats: Night of Terror", the modest worship 70 "Willard" lame sequel "Ben "," Willard "remake of 2003 with Crispin Glover and surprisingly recent rhythm films by former directors Tibor Ticaks (" Rats ") and John Lafia (" Rats "). To get crazy!
