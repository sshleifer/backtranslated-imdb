Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic people) and involves Joe Don Baker watching an Italian mafiot. Joe Don's character is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this film is to shoot people and be arrested again everywhere. Everyone in the movie hates him, just as everybody hates Greydon Clark. I liked an older image of Greydon, "Angel's Revenge," because it was a wiping for thirty-year-old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs!
