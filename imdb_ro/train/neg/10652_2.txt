You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The Safety Killer! That's right, in the Killer Workout movie, a great movie, if I've ever seen it, the unseen murderer sends the victims (or her?) With a novelty safety pin. It's a strange choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the movie never tries to clarify where the killer has gotten such a thing. As the title suggests, an aerobic gym is besieged by a killer killer and everyone is suspect. In fact, the film offers so little clues about the identity of the killer, precisely because everyone in the film is a potential killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone, but the killer is spinning dead, is really a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, while the entire distribution of names is killed, aerobics courses continue earnestly. In fact, nothing can stop dancing. While three men are killed in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; a character dies but is still prominently seen in subsequent training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he did when he was called Killer Workout and not Logical Workout. Baking chips, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of exposed females' meat are discarded to a great extent. Just like the woman caught in the tanning bed, I felt very unpleasant until the end of the Killer training. Finally, fortunately, THE END lit on the screen. What happened next? You've succeeded, photos of women working. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
