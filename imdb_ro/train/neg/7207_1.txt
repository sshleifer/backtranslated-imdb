I was a big fan of the original cartoon series and I was looking forward to finally seeing Gadget on the big screen - but never in my wildest dreams did I expect something so terribly awkward. The rhythm was far too fast, there was no plot, and a "wowser!" - what the hell is that ?? It was "WOWSERS !!".
