Do I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything Brookmyres' first novel had. Everything, apart from the story, laughs, black humor, political intrigue, character, plot, and a simple appearance of meaning. spoilers; <br /> <br /> Beginning to end. They made a plot, they had a love story between Parablane and a policeman, and what was it, Dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a spectator and who the hell was Annette Crosby? /> Apparently they made an adaptation of three hours, then cut it up to 90 minutes. (Even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please do not do this to another Brookmyres book (especially the "Land of the Blind").
