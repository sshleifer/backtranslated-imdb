What "noise" fails to make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer handle the tiring noise of the city, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie that has such a credible credibility as the "Desire of Death". He is intelligent in points; In particular, a scene in which our hero tries to read through Hagel: "I'm too stupid to understand this." Read and reread a paragraph in confusion, we read it and you never get it. Then, just a car alarm goes off. Throughout the movie there are constant interferences of alarms and noises of the city. Though it generally does little to help us understand our hero, which allows them to ruin their marriage and be distracted by the side plots instead of digging deeper into his person. The movie itself is too unseen to notice its own sound problems, unconditional editing and visible booms. No, "Noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not collapse. In general, he leads a logistic point home, one you have not thought of. At least I did not. Though, totally ninety minutes, it could not have ended earlier. The story dragged and seemed to be lost as soon as it started. This is another of those movies you could see at a movie festival, but it probably will not be taken for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you're really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
