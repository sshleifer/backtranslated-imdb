Knights were just the beginning of a series, a pilot, one can say. Crying (I should not say this, there was no plot) was not logical and there were many mistakes, such as [warning, summing up the plot]: At the beginning of the movie, someone said there were only a few of those cyborgs (bad guys), but after the climax, Nea found out that much more was left. And he was told that the cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training, Nea could kill them with one shot. The film was just a clean shot. I was not surprised when I found out that the star was a boxer with a shot. There was a positive thing in the whole movie: it really was a great laugh when I looked at it and talked about it with my friends. We recommend watching it if you need to laugh.
