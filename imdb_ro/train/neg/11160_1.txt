This type of "inspirational" sugar is enough to make you sick. It telegrams his feelings as the greatest traffic light on earth. It removes audience from its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it. The big finish is swimming in the orchestration of crying that should work like cables on a dead car; I think you need such an excuse to feel if you're stupid enough to see a movie as simple and humorous as it. Streep shines and wonders if it really has the depth of feeling on the screen or if it's just - a display turned on and off like a light. Because for my life I can not see how it could find life in such a film bag. Even if it's based on a true story and a source of inspiration, I'm sure setting, execution, and shows are playing like a third-generation TV or half-minded high school drama.
