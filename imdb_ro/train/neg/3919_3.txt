This movie is not as good as everyone. actors are at a low level, and the story is very comical. I have respected the fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan ... it's fantasy ... That's just NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-DEVELOPMENT ... Why they included this Splatter language, it's all getting worse. The only good thing is Cutter's cinema and work.
