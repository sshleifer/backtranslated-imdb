I do not know what he was talking about the other review. It's definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact, I do not think there's a decent girl in it. No, it's just chic, stupid, science fiction trick Ed Wood. And it's bad. I can not even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw her late at night and I was in shock. The fact that this movie has ever been released is an insult to all of us. The actors were either friends of the producer, or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the rhythm is insanely slow. For me, however, music goes beyond everything. A monkey could write a better theme with a xylophone toy. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, look at it. You will be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
