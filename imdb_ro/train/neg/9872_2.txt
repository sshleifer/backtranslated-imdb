A sort of hard-to-believe film from this book could manage to overcome horror! The plot is so controversial and unbelievable. . . starting with a ton of guilt on a small baby to spare his pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people (including the clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Then we have a wife who, apparently along a ferry trip, goes from being relatively happy shortly after the blows. A very unpleasant mother and coo coo, helped, supported and supported by a group of politically correct friends! Moving land off an island off the coast of South Carolina has not helped the story, although it may have helped film budgets. The very beautiful buildings that are supposed to host the monastery did not seem to logically fit into an island small enough to require golf carts and so little ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this movie and her hairstyle certainly belongs in another decade. Also, there is simply no chemistry between her and any of the male leaders. I disliked very much the book from which it was made, but read everything. The movie that I kept surfing back and forth had to go every time the sugar music got too much. If you do not like an incredible story, a wooden action, a contorted mixture of religion / mythology / allegory, my advice is to ignore it. Oh, and maybe a little critic, but would not a father take care of a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the landscape
