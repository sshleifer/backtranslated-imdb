I watched this movie yesterday and I was very disappointed. Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh had to essentially carry this unbelievably incredible script for five hours (or how much time it really was). From the beginning, every element of this movie is unbelievable. This movie made me chicote several times, but it was mostly out of shock that the director / writer actually waited for us to believe many disordered messy elements who tried to make this film together. Gray (Graham) and her privacy issues. Things become interesting when she realizes that she and her brother unexpectedly have too much of a thing. Interesting, interesting. However, instead of revealing this story to something credible and tasty, the director keeps Gray in these playful upheavals that never make any sense. Being a LGBT individual, this film seemed to be equivalent to what all heterosexuals believe through the process of coming. (I'll be insulted if it's the writer's oddity). If it was not for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was forced to understand), I would give her a negative of 3 stars.
