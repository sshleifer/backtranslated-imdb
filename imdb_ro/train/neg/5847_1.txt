I like the quality craftsmanship, and this is ranked there with some of the best. cg is out of this world or at least pre-dating our world and the madness of a 6-foot-man in a rat suit that follows after people are laughingly bad. I was very happy about this, but the act is so terrible, and even the boredom scene is of no use in it. just a complete waste of time if I ever saw one. I do not know who has lost more time if I look at this or the poor digging that dragged her to do it in the hope that this will launch their career. I can assure you, do not you? However, in a brighter note, I succeeded in making Kevin Bacon's 6 degree success in this film, so I think it was almost worth watching his 91 minutes.
