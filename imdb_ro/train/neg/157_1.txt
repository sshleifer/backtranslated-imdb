OK First of all, the movie seems to have been filmed in the '80s I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Secondly, the plot was everywhere, even on the bat the story is confusing. If there was a short prolog or an introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate the fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and filthy. The scenes did not happen smoothly and the characters were weird. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was hard to understand. I like Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for a fantastic Chinese epic film, I would recommend the promise (visually stunning, the plot is an interesting and good development of the character), not this movie. Be sure to be disappointed.
