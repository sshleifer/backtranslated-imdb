I found the mediocre characters and the uninteresting story. I never had to read this book (fortunately), or it would have been a painful experience. I received the tickets for free preview, but it's still not worth my time or my friend. I think this story does not deserve to tell us. It's like saying that the elders have a past before they become old (I'm not kidding). The life of the main characters was painful to watch, a generation not better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did everything they can with an agonizing story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review to counteract the positive positive comments that unfortunately have persuaded me to try this movie.
