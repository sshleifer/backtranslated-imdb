This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most disgusting American slag; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in America's dross by excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer have taken huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when he talked about the plot, he thought it was a good idea. is not. It is abusive rubbish from the very hearts of Satan himself (who might have written a better script if he wanted to think of him). Robert Jones as Exce producer, who spends money on taxpayers (lottery boys) on this nonsense, should answer. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline ??? Please - the camp like a Christmas tree, Deathline ... "Door of the Doors" is a classic British movie very bad, we really do not need a reminder. And, of course, we do not need a poor rate, the second, badly written, badly developed, and garbage so bad. All of this from the British financing agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I'm resting my case. I'm not paying any money to see that. It is an absolute and total carp - the one who saves the grace for the producers is that they have a huge cash stone ... our money ... because they did. They should hang their heads in shame. I turned over to the low and low level of this movie. It makes me say that our national body to support the film actually believed it deserves support. There is no hope for the British cinema industry, while idiots run the show. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, I forgive you !!!
