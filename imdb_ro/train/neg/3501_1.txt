I understand the jokes pretty well, they are not good. The show is horrible. I understand, and that's another awful thing about that. The only cool character I've ever seen is that he was a hobo in that episode, but then I see the other episode, including the episode, and the show is horrible. It's not funny, NO funny! I do not want people to say "Only intelligent people succeed," because if they are so intelligent why people are judging, they do not even know and say they are not intelligent enough or intellectual to understand that? It's like saying "The sky is red," but you never look out. But, anyway, this is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, you understand them, they are just horrible, their controversy is very limp, her jokes and other jokes on the body fluids are in - stupid mistakes and usually consist of a very bad action. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not even a clever comment.
