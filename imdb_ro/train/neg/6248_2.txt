Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science is coming out of the window, and "faith" and "consensus" become the subject of discussion. Because of an unsuccessful Al Gore Documentary. Instead of promoting intelligent discussions, he kept the debate on "faith" and "consensus". Of course, when you try to sell the world in spending three billion dollars to "stop global warming," it might be a matter of telling scientific truth: we do not know how much of the current warming was caused by people. Perhaps none of them, maybe some of them, or perhaps over the next ice age, and we were really lucky we did not boil the planet. But it remains that we do not know. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "believe" in "consensus." It does not matter that a scientist who deviates from "consensus" is ostracized. It does not matter that the scientific inquiry is about removing from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in consensus, neither Copernicus nor Galileo. Why so much contempt for those researchers who would advance on the ground asking for difficult questions? If global warming is so indisputable, certainly some people who test this theory can not be so threatening. What happens here? This is the movie we hope Al Gore. Istead, chose to support his support with the true "believers" of "consensus." Sad, indeed.
