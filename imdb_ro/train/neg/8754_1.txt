This movie is really terrible. After seeing the advertising for this, I thought she might have her charms ... but she did not. Girls can not act or sing. The soundtrack of this movie is full of songs and it's not a beautiful view, a terrible story, an incredible story, one of Disney's worst movies at FAR! Ally is not a bad actress about Phil of the Future, so I do not know what happened in Cow Belles. And her sister, AJ, seems to be just a journey to her sisters "fame", and she has no talent ever. At the end of the film the girls finally learn some moral clich√©, but this is up to the end to save this train train movie. <br /> <br /> Great
