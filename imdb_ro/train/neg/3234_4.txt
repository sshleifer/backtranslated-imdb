Well, how do you really appreciate a movie like this one? Does it even have kinematic value? It's a movie that tries to get closer to being a champagne movie. Basically, the entire movie is simply a bunch of guys who torture a young girl. It's not very attractive, and besides, it's not so realistic. It is obvious that the film has tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is just too fake to work as intended. Spanking and stomping are all amazing and false, as well as sounds. They are often just kicking in the floor, rather than in front, obviously. Also, the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tainted. If that were true, she would have shouted it. There are more groans than screaming in this, though. The film is clearly low budget and it is a valuable attempt to try to get something shocking and realistic as well as original and challenging with very limited resources. You do not think this movie has had a big impact, though at the time it was released, although it must have done something good because it has released six sequels in total. gore will most likely be disappointed with this film, although there are still some fetish people who will take a shot from this film. <br /> 4/10
