When I saw the advertisement for this, I had to see that. Now, forgive me, but it has been so long since I saw that I do not remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw had no resemblance to the "movie" they sold. I was bored, disturbed and incredibly disappointed with this film. And if it was not bad enough, they had to sink it more with awful reggae music. It's not really music for a horror movie, is it? I think if you have never seen the commercial (or trailer, I think), you might think this is a hot thing. For my money, the ad was much better.
