This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It's an extreme tragedy. He left me sick to my stomach. I hated him. I think if they want to make a movie like this, they should be human enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen the movie if I knew. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I `m tired of this. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It's been a few days and I still have an unpleasant taste in my mouth in this movie. I have never been more disappointed with a movie and I have not written any comment about a bad movie. I really think a real deception was involved in this trailer, because if it showed the true intent of the movie, nobody would have seen it.
