Poor Robert Englund makes a new flop at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes horror movies pretty good, but he has not done that badly at this point. Englund plays well-known Marque De Sade, who in the seventeenth century was tasked with his obsession with pain and the pleasure of bringing pain to him, as well as looking at others to be in pain. The story is so confused with the flip flop from one century to another and I became confused about what was happening and what the purpose of this film was. All I saw was a young lady who was caught by a strange lesbian who wants to keep it for herself, and the young lady has become fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and learned she went out to kill her and then Englund a century of the other claiming to be the descendant of Sade and trying to kill her for reminding her of Mrs. Momoselle (who wrote the wrong) or whoever was in the image above the De Sades wall. The film was terrible, I'm surprised by Hooper for engaging Englund in this film, and the special effects were so fake and ridiculous, especially the side of the eye. Englund tries to get back from the hit once "Nightmare on Elm St." by using these needles to remove the eyes from the eye. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
