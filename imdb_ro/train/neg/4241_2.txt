Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to the woman on the TV station - is right: LAPD IS a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this movie does not change anything about it. Okay, here are good cops, moral policemen, even a black one, a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, I admit. Reality is not so. And most important to action fans: the shooting is boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. No more. Play Counter Strike, then you'll have at least something to do. The only moral of this film is: LAPD is good now. We do not have bad guys in it anymore. If you like non-critical, euphemistic police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for room and editing).
