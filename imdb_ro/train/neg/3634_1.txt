Prancing fantasy for kids, which gives Joan Plowright a star billing, but little to do. Poor children pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk), while his best friend Hazel runs for the mayor --- he is 13 years old! Total pedestrian in any way, plus the additional disadvantage of the girls 'and baseball boys' syrup performance. Definitely less effort for Showtime - no limits?
