Charles Bronson continued his 80s crisis with what might be his worst film in the decades, if not ever. Inside him plays a detective who goes a long way to discover a pimp that kidnapped an Asian girl and sells it to the best bidder. It's a shameful act of action and it's probably the most depressing movie ever made. A lot of people consider the continuation of Death Wish as Bronson's worst movie. The sequels of "Death Wish" were not great movies, but in most cases they were made competent and very visible. However, Kinjite is a totally boring thriller, which is punctuated by the bad racism and the death of children. It's really a refren film and it's all aggravated by trying to preach a "Law and Justice" mentality that's too overburdened to really say something. Indeed, the film begins with the interruption of minor sex with Bronson, then the illiterate violation of the pedophile with a dildo. The theater in Chicago, which I watched, began to look at the inconveniences of this scene, just to pant on the left-handed pimp that raped the girl in this film. He has nothing to say but exploit, and indeed, the film was not enough written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and to offer something that works. Bronson seems more in things, but clearly this is far too reluctant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the greatest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately the worst. The sequences of action are also weak. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4- (Awful)
