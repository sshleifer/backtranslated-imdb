When I go to see a zombie movie, I do not expect Oscar-sized or Godfather's performance, but I expect the actors do not seem at least to read their cue cards and the dialogue that does not seem to be written 10 minutes before the actor reads it in the room. This movie was terrible, actually I got up and left for about 25 minutes and went along and looked at Cold Creek Manor, which was not good, but it seemed Citizen Kane was compared to this pile of nonsense. In addition, the girls were very nice, probably the only thing I kept in my chair for more than the first 5 minutes, actually I left after the hottest one was killed, there was nothing to me hold interest after that.
