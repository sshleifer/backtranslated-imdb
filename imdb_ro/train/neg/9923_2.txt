As I write this review in 2008, we are burdened with a remake culture. Film studios seem determined to destroy as many classic movies as possible with unnecessary updates including "King Kong," "The Wicker Man," and virtually any movie that ever played Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as evidenced by "Dough for Do-Do". A completely unnecessary colorful version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece, "Porky in Wackyland," "Dough for Do-Do," sucks life from the original by spraying colors on all of Clampett's original pieces and adding new blades, supervised by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a completely inadequate director to manipulate Clampett's source material, although in reality no director could hope to get close to Clampett's inspiration. Inevitably, then, "Do-Do Dough" is nothing more than the rape of a classic with a terrible new name attached. For cartoon fans like me, their equivalent to a "Casablanca" color.
