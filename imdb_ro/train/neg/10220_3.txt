First of all, this movie can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with cheyenne's ambassador to Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long, boring middle section, totally misguided by Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison. Mrs. Bergen spreads four inappropriate letters each time she opens her mouth and shows that it just came out of a 1970's Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she keeps zero interest with zero credibility. The third and final section involves the total slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obvious that it was overwhelmed by anti-war propaganda, that it is just as long, scandalous and controversial. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why do not you actually look at the movie you comment, instead of chirping your liberal crap. This is not a political site, it's for reviewing movies. - MERK
