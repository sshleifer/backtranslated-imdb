A slow, boring and dimensional film! Good casting with a clich√©ed dialogue, a boring story line and a soulless direction from Mr. Marshall! The conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution on the Asian continent, heartless, new information and depth. The character of lead does not seem to occur because of its small fizique and fake lenses. The lexicon used by gheisas sounds forceful and a little too sophisticated for limited exposure in education. The story continues for several hours, trying to convince this little, boring, flat, Asian girl, is the final ghee, they actually say in the movie, "She's destined to become a legend," say hardy the case! The movie is simply boring, it's nice to look at, it has very few interesting moments as many could find by going out for cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger, you do not believe the message and this girl has not filled the shoe! Borin, boring, jump over him!
