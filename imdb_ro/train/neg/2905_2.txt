The expectations were somewhat great for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could not hurt from great movies like Anchorman, The Virgin 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Well, I was wrong. I'll start with what's good with this movie: At some points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There is a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it is almost entirely for him to be given the place to do his job. He is a talented individual, undoubtedly, and it is a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train job. With that out of the way, I'll discuss what went awful. The film starts with Dan Burns, a three-sided widow who is considered a national union counseling column. He prepares the girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives have been gathering for a while between them. The family is high on the list of things that make this movie terrible. No family does not behave like this. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or Leave Beaver. They are a cartoon of what we think is a family when we reach the age of seven. It gets to the point where they become accustomed and simply frustrated. Soccer with touches, crossword contests, family bowling, and talent shows are NOT THE WINNING OF THE ACTUAL PERSON ACTION. It's almost bad. Another big defect is the Carell woman should fall. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching an accidental victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine should be unique and original to this woman comes as a slight delay. It makes me think that this movie takes place on another planet. I left the theater asking what I saw. After thinking about it, I do not think it was too much.
