This was, in short, a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was horribly embarrassed; I could not feel any feeling behind the words spoken by the characters. The lines were delivered too hurriedly and felt rather out of place. They could have been quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was nonexistent, and he was watching an American Rochester feel weird. He could have tried at least to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but that just did not work. I felt I was looking at the most important moments of Jane Eyre, where the main stories of the story had been randomly chosen without taking into account the flow of the story. The landscape and the music were great, but I could not feel any passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester, and the movie left me totally motionless. If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the BBC version of 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two are brilliant adaptations.
