A young scientist tries to continue his dead father's work on limb regeneration. His arrogant mother convinced him to kill his own father and monitor his progress for his evil purposes. A young doctor uses reptilian DNA that he extracts from a big creature and when his arm is conveniently broken a few minutes later, he injects with his formula and develops a new killer arm ... Of course, the special effects of " Broken links "are pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is terrible. The cut arm behaves like a snake and kills a few people. The biggest business. The actor is mediocre and the climax is stupid3 out of 10.
