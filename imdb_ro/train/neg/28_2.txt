This movie is terrible. You do not have to read this review anymore. If you intend to watch it, it is enough to say - not (if you do not study how to do a good movie). The actor is awful ... a serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought it was interesting to find someone who talks and looks like Michael Madsen just to find out he is actually him! A new low even for him! The terrain is terrible. People who claim to be original or good have never seen a decent film before. Even at the standard of Hollywood action movies, this is a terrible movie. Do not watch him !!! Go for a jogging instead - at least you will not feel that you are killing yourself.
