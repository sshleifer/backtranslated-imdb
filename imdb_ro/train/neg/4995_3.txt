I found it a real task to stay with this movie. The soundtrack was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was said. There was little to move the plot, and often the action simply stopped and there was a long period of conversation that seemed strange to the movie. These conversations have passed between family groups, and the observer has been left to try to put together what the common thread was that they have tied together. It's rare to write a movie so low and do it in this case because the whole viewing experience has allowed me to think "so what" and "why I lost my time looking at me."
