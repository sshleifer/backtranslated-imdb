Okay, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. The television program "The Hunter Crocodile" had a bad attitude, bad scenarios and a bad direction between Steve, who captured or taught us about animals. It was fun as an animal / specialist seeker. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, it was almost nonexistent. Casting was horrible. The actor did not even deserve elemental actors at school level. The direction must also be defective. If you can not achieve decent half-way performance from your actors, no matter how bad the scenario is, you do not have to be so good first. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never seen this movie. Of course, I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son), while with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the film well, but he never asked to see it again. If you want pleasant memories of Steve Irwin, buy his DVD series. Avoid this movie like plague. If I were Steve, I know I do not want to be remembered for this movie. Watch it: avoid this movie!
