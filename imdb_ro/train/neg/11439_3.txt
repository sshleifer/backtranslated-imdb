It was obvious that this film was designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, where I had a little time and enjoyed the most. However, it was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying as the hell itself). Her action was overcome and seemed to be excessive in comparison to her colleagues who had relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more, because there was a proper budget for arrangements, actors and a decent story line. My wife and I agreed that this was "Muck" at the end of the movie, because the movie ended in a very painful embarrassment! More luck next time, Miss Graham's hope is linked to the type of movies she's part of, such as From Hell.
