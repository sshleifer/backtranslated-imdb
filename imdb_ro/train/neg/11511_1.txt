I was lucky to see this movie at a US presentation. With hesitation in all horror, I am shocked that I have seen many good comments here on the IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fit in that week of the seventies after the 1969 revolution; this movie just smells like ......., well, nothing really. It's so bad. Imagine a bad perfume made commercial - see what I mean? Madonna has never been able to act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with each of those years, coming more and more to resemble a skinny meerkat. Guy Ritchie, who has built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, could never drive - his films are deep, very loud, fashion shows. It does not disappoint here; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this disaster. Please people, take a little of the good reviews this movie received from the other posters below. They are quite obvious business plants. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humble himself more by giving money. <br /> <br />
