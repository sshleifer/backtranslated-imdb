Probably the only thing that took my movie up to four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the great porters of the world of incompetence. . . and yet it is one of the only anchors that prevent this from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, he offers a respectful blend of gangster charm and direct man to Chris Kattan's madness madness. Also, Richard Roundtree takes care of respectable performances, such as harassing boss Vincea Shaw, as a talented female FBI agent who raises his head off a glass ceiling, and Fred Ward as a counselor to Falk and Benedict Arnold . has some wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young man Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, might have been a great comedy. Kattan, who seems to alter Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, only offers miserable misery. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray his brothers, do not go beyond their proven ability. There are some very funny scenes, but they are too few and separated from too boring. What I really miss here is what always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" of rider on paper. There are no cultural references that only adults receive. . no double entender. . it is, however, foolish. And, by the way, this does not mean everything I recommend for you for 9 years because we hope they have a better taste and less fascination with some parts of the body and their functions.
