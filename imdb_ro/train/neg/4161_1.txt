A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and a sub-par (less) dialogue plagues this TV production that could hardly be interesting, even with a billions of dollars worth of production. Characters are not credible in their motives, actions or professions. The plot reads like a bad shit Dungeons and Dragons (TM), but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are issues of severe continuity and the degree of unnecessary interaction between the characters has at least this author. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. Watch any episode of the Dark Angel, and you'll have more acting, dialogue and plotting. Yuck.
