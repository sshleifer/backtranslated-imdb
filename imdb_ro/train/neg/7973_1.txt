I'm going to a lot of movies, I often bring my 5-year-old son, I'm glad I did not bring him to him. There are many references to sex and to a slim dive, though, this is not the main reason why I would not go to him. Trailers lead you to think it's a bold comedy; however, practically all fun moments are in preview. I waited for it to become interesting, funny or anything but serious; however, I almost fell asleep as the less-favored story was drawn. I understand that dogs can be a wonderful company, saying the whole story was focused on a dog that behaves badly that the owners were not skilled enough to train. If a man caused so much damage and chaos, that person would be forbidden. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a loss of their talent. The best way to sum up this film is that the young man becomes a disobedient dog, the young man falls in love with the dog, dies the dog, lives a young man. The end.
