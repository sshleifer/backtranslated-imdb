If you hope for NEVER new, you chose the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual resumption of its predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but we hope they were not serious when they did. This movie is like doing a DVD with the biggest hits in the first 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
