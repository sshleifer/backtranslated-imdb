This movie is always shown fast on the cable lately, so .. There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight against either Luke Wilson, or as villy "villian" villain in this movie. Female actresses are very cute, and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's "funny" that Luke's friend even more nasty / dorkier / stupid is around, but well, that's what we get. None of the female leaders will ever talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is that they cry and cry and fight and so on 2 guys that were best described on Friday 13 4. Dead * @ $ #
