Well, what can I say are B-grade movies and there are B-grade movies and this certainly falls into it. However, because it is obvious that even movie makers know it's not a credible movie (take a look at closing credits), it can be forgiven. The land is basically a condemned psychic killer is killed. Accidentally, its genetic material is mixed with an experimental acid that combines and then is lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you think so. The Snowman, Jack Frost, is after Sherif, who put him behind the bars. In this way, Jack Frost ends up killing half the city. This movie has no real frills, and the effects in itself remind me of the B-Class films of the 1950s. Only that is worth looking for a laugh. A movie to pass the time.
