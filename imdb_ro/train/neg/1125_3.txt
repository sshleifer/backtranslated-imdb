I went to school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard about this movie, I do not know if he was in the theater at all. I do not remember my name. I've seen it, it's one of the specialties after school. The act is OK, not great. The plot was pretty weak and the lines were pretty weird. So, the only comment I can give this movie is "Eh," I borrowed the Jeremy movie, if I was in a movie rental room, that's one I would walk around, I have seen, I would not recommend anyone to the middle school age. I also noticed that often when urban children are portrayed, the slang is too much used or exceeded. I often think that's what makes their characters unbelievable.
