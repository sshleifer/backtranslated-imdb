This movie was simply upset by the MST3K and for good reason. First of all because it's a "cop" with Joe Don Baker, about whom we all know he is a police actor as good as Michael Jackson is a Western country singer. the devices face the ugly heads, the barracks, the kidnapping children, the bad guys, the police officers, the revenge, the revenge / justice, the endless goons and of course the bad. Do not track this without an MST3K filter.
