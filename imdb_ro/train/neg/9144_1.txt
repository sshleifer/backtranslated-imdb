This movie is just really terrible, the candy-eye that plays Ben can only compensate for anything else that is wrong with this movie. The writer / director / producer / leading actor, etc., probably had a good idea to create a film to deal with important issues related to homosexual marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes, and almost everything else a problem that generates a homosexual of these times, but trying to provoke every problem in such a bad film conceived little justice for any of these causes. The script is poor, casting is very common, but dialogue and acting are just giving. The homosexual brother is played by the biggest actor in the camp and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I have seen more passion in a corn flakes advert). The action is rigid, and forced dialogue (a scene where the brother nourishes his detective, was the most accentuated line). I'm glad to see that the creator of this wreck did not push any other garbage into the distribution, and if he thinks so, I have some tips - DO NOT DO.
