I'll get to the movie in a minute. First, someone wanted "proof" of Clinton's comments at Georgetown, where he claimed that the US "deserves" attacks from 9-11. Well, here's what Clinton said: "In the first crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 Jews in it and killed every woman and child who was a Muslim on the Temple Mount. that the story is said today in the Middle East and that we still pay for it. "Do we still pay for it? Whaddya means "we," pal? The sailors did not go to Mount Temple. But, indeed, Clinton never really went out and said that we "deserve" 9-11. Like all his statements during his presidency, he REQUIRE that I deserved 9-11. Just show the "facts" A, B, C, and maybe D and let the listener deduce that he has to add up to the X conclusion. When, indeed, most of Clinton's "Facts" add to guacamole. <br /> <But this is out of the way. We're here to talk about movies, not about politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not escape his deformed politics. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on Reagan's era, and at what better moment than when Stone's dreams were almost fulfilled on the day when Reagan bought almost the farm. In the impossibility of finding an unfavorable scene or scheme in Hinckley's attempt to assassinate, he invented one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the constitutional authority chain, Haig is transformed from a civil servant who should have entered his remedial civic into a megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to rub his hands together like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to release the Hounds. Stone even recruits the Hollywood person to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. A guy you like to hate to see. Overall, the movie is OK. On average, it is below the average. Do not bother renting or buying. Try to catch it by cable. 4 out of 10.
