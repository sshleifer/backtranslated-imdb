... because the lieutenants chose that. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. Worst case, if I needed a script: if Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but she was dissatisfied that her "people" had left the missionary, he would have put that first helicopter and would have gone those refugees on the border without her. He would not compromise his refugee package. It does not work like that. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we have to have drama. That's why we make movies, because reality is not so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had a functional chemistry. That being said, there are some good scenes in the movie. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the sun" deserves the DVD rental fee. Check him on a rainy day and you'll be happy.
