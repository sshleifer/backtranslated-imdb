Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) receives a change of sex from a doctor (John Carradine - beat beat) and goes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then she decides to destroy masculine masculinity (or something like that) and aims to teach film history to a college acclaimed by John Huston (do not ask) and to break up a happy young couple (Roger Herren, young, beautiful, Farrah Fawcett - da Farrah Fawcett). They took a great novel by Gore Vidal, which was unpolluted and, of course, tried to film it. They also hired an English guy with a decisive anti-American attitude and hired a lot of "talents" (Welch, Reed) and old angels (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West) all together and .... SURPRISE !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The film won an X rating when it was released (it was reduced to an R), especially due to a truly original scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch tries to have sex with Fawcett. The movie is very scattershot ... the scenes jump all over and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all, but I never get bored. <br /> <br /> Action is wild ... The reed is horrible ... very sad. Huston chews the landscape again and again and again into an extreme nausea. Welch is not really bad as Myra, but its lines do not make sense, so you never know what to do about it. West is hard in the movie (a blessing) and it's really sick enough to hear a woman of nearly 80 years, cracking sex jokes. Roger Herren (what happened to ...) was very young, beautiful and not as bad as Rusty. Fawcett is all right. It's hard to find things to say about it ... just look at the unerring. You have to watch the movie - believe it!
