This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was bad, to the end. It reminded me a lot of something on the home video market in the 1980s. I would have given one, but there were short moments when you could see the really stressed actors to make it worth it. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene of the doc. Underwater lighting did not seem to come in any way, and whenever someone we had to take care of, it was almost to run out of the air, this air reservoir would look like that. I would avoid this if there is nothing else on the shelf. A good day.
