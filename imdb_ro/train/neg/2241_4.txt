I rather remember that I enjoyed it a few years ago, but I came back to her, I wonder why. I think she always looks good and the girls do pretty good, but men just let it down. Why, in so many English movies about sex, must we have so ineffective people along cute girls? Moreover, this begins as predictable as a similar sex masquerade in Confessions, but about a third of the way (while we start enjoying the presence of the wonderful Me Me Lai), the movie asks us to start taking it seriously . Not only that, but central rock clubs and cannabis sequences are very hard and just stomach. In short, this is not as bad or innocently as serious as it seems to intend. Richard O'Sullivan may, as a central figure, have been able to help, but I think this is one of the worst performances. It's just worth the ladies.
