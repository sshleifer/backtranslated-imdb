I hired this movie on DVD. I knew the movie would not rise to what she promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw Skinface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I had to rent it. It starts pretty well, assuming that champagne movies are broadcast by cable. However, the main character has nothing to do to make you feel bad about her, and the end of the movie really lets you hang. There are too many unanswered questions. It was a wonderful scene at the end, which surprised me totally, but generally this movie is very sub, but I think it deserved the rental fee of 3.99 USD.
