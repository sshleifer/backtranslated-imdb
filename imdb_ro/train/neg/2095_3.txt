Battlestar Gallactica was so great because she had a tight writing, great looks, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, they had hot men and women running inside and in uniform. Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors smoking a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being elsewhere (yes, this is a Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot of teenage rage. A lot of naked women spinning (but in the background, which I'm sure will be cut for the evening) and a simple vision of towels. None of the actors, except Polly Walker, caught my attention. An hour and a half, I wondered once again when it was over. So, what should I bring back? Science-fiction? It's very terrible at this. The actors? Besides Polly Walker's fine tower, it's not very interesting here. There are not even "hotties" in the cast, except probably for Esai, although for the younger set he is old enough since he is over 25 years old. I liked BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica and, unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a short run for that as a series if she does not really sharpen the SciFi pencil and get to work by doing more than OC on another planet.
