Warren Beatty's director's intention to turn Chester Gould's comic book into a live action cartoon (with Beatty himself at the head of a foot detective) had sweet innocence of nostalgia - unusual and interesting coming from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a necessary hammer, fun for a while, but ultimately tedious. Dick Tracy tries to trap Big Boy Caprice, helped by Tess Trueheart's love, but has been hampered by Mahoney, who has no bad breath. For the first half hour or so, Oscar winning art direction and set design are great to absorb, but as the scripted phrase along the predictable (without any real dumpster in writing) things start to freeze. Al Pacino got a surprise in claiming Oscar nomination as a bad guy and Madonna (which is mostly used as a decorative support) gets to sing "I always get my man "by Stephen Sondheim, Song. A lot of hearts, thanks to Beatty - who was dedicated to his vision - but the picture is too cold and calculated. He does not have heat. * 1/2 from ****
