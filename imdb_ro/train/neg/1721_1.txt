A meteoric crater lake (for this reason, our title) that wakes up a Plesiosaur who continues to taste the hick population (in California, that capital of the world.) They are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster" , who somehow managed to get rid of MST3K. While the film is guilty of many crimes, the worst case is the one of the worst crime. Arnie and Mitch, two helpless reds who serve as comic relief. They struggle, struggle for the stock of "banjo music," women's ogle, and act like pathetic apologies to mankind. Characters are so bad that they have to be considered a crime against humanity.
