I just do not see how a Concorde-New Horizons movie, directed by Jim Wynorski, with Andrew Stevens's talent and a doll might be bad. It just rages the mind, is not it? Let's make no mistake. "Munchie Strikes Back" is really a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been around for centuries. For reasons not fully explained by the end of the movie, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (her most important problem) is that she has a balloon payment due to her mortgages in two weeks ... to such a low of $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not come with the money because she was just fired. OK ... JUST is the keyword in that sentence. What the...? Did she plan to pay her with one salary? Perhaps it would have been a good idea to have spent the last years of saving for that ... are you thinking? Munchie has magical powers similar to those a cute would possess ... but there is no limit to the number of desires you can do! Munchie brings the boy a lot of fancy things for a night, but then the child asks for him to be sent back to the mall that Munchie "borrows". Annoying robbery also uses its former abilities to help the boy win a baseball game through cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Unfortunately, those parents badly seeing the game do not think it's strange at all. Hmm. Anyway, I would like to end this, because that has already removed enough life force as it is. You will be really moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing your mother, hits a dog who is beating her. Your heart will melt in its charm when it notices the dollar bills that will be thrown into the front yard and wonder how snow can be in the summer. "Credits of Munchie Strikes Back" have promised another movie that follows, as I think, "Munchie Hangs Ten". So far, the audience watching the movie was robbed of what would certainly have been a cinema tour. Heh. 1/10
