I wanted so much to enjoy this movie. It was moving very slowly and it was just boring. If it had been on TV, it would take 15-20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A cast and a great photographer were working on a faulty foundation. If this is based freely on the director's life, why did not anyone see that writing in itself was "free". Then he directed it at the pace of a snail, which could have been the source of some people who nodded during the movie. Music is climbing, but for a different movie, not for that ... for the soap bar. There were moments when the dialogue was not easy to understand when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone, because I heard some rumors about who said what. Why can not I make better movies at Hollywood? He had a nugget of a wonderful story, but he was poorly executed.
