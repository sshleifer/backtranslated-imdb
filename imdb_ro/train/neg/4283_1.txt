Unfortunately, it is true. The "foreign legion" clearly sets out the absolute parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As has already been said, the author has lost the faculty to coalesce content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally worried about the mechanical trick of choosing to random news subjects and joining together without any legitimacy, he gathers only a mess of events that are incapable of following the smallest line of story. The level of the script is similar to an amateur piece "The Song of Romania" about the glorious facts of socialist realism - only in the opposite direction: while the Communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sweet festivity, now Daneliuc is so obsessed with negativism and scatology disgusting. The content of the ideas is zero and the "message", infant and didactic, at the kindergarten level. Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional principles. He can no longer organize a dramatic situation, arrange it in a correct film scene, correctly shape it, and edit it according to the simplest rules of cinematic grammar. His level of storytelling in film images is similar to that of words like: "Man is not okay" and all people are donkeys! "What a huge distance from the impressive artist from 1976-1984, who created works such as" Race "," Microphone Test "," Hunting of foxes "and even" Cruise "and" Glissando "... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
