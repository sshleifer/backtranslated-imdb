My wife and I saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and we thought "Jon Heder, Diane Keaton, Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach must be better than summer, so I ordered her "Lawrence Welk" would bring more laughter than "Mama's Boy." In fact, I felt sorry for the actors to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and I did not imagine what should have been for them in fact, let's tell her the lines in front of a room. Maybe, at least, maybe next time they will be offered a movie of this kind, they will "Just say no!"
