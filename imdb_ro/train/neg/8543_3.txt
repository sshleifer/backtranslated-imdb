I admit I had to advance through this badly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes - NIMIC is happening and everyone has already described the "plot". But someone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher knife is stabbed by a wig and pushed on the grass in the front yard! I think the boy did it, he never explained. Really trippy. <br /> <br /> I would have liked this movie to have been a better-written or thought-out film, because what we have left cute and a movie that makes no sense is not a "smart" movie, it's just a poorly executed film. I would like to see a clean version and, if there are no missing pictures, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a strange movie that is the best if it's fast forward!
