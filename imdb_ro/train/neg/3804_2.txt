This is a bad movie of any standard. The story of Match Point had some intrigue and direction and wrote a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing her own culture with classic English crime and exploring what she could do with it). Scoop, however, has nothing of all of this. It is inadequately written, the two causes are hopeless and the story itself has no interest. The genre he parodies requires at least some kind of subplot with wise explanations and ties (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?). Allen's delightful and moody versions of various genres from Hollywood (Jade / Rosei Purple Curse in Cairo, etc.) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
