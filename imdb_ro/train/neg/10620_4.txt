Despite some interesting (and bold) sequences, NBTN never works. There are explosive boats, hat crime, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they are interwoven with long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie seems bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered bold when filmed. Add to this British "over-correct" characters and you feel like you were brought into a Sherlock Holmes movie. Finally, cinema is very common. There are plenty of opportunities for beautiful photos in the countryside, or complex pictures of a person who is dragged into a big fire, but everything is unimaginable and boring. Sure only for the fans of Lee and Cushing.
