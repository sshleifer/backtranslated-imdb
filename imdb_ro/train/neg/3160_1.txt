You know you have trouble watching a comedy, when the funny parts of it are from animal distribution. It is a pity that the parrot, "Cat & Dog", was only in support and not the other way round, because the people in it were quite abasal throughout the world. If it was you, Paul, Eve, the Lake (what kind of name is that), Jason, and Lindsay, I'd forget this scrawl and do something else, because you're all as fun as if you looked at dry paint and awful boot actors. /> The main gang of the movie is one of the characters that shout, I'm not Gay, which is fun as if you were not, you could change your mind if you had to deal with the three bosses, boring and dare say women very clear lead in the movie. The worst film I have seen for years and hopefully I never see such a bad thing, though I do not expect it.
