First of all, let's start by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be praised for having to be associated with this. I had to give this 1 I would not let him give it a zero. do you want to know how bad this movie is? my mother calls me out of town and says, "Son, I've just watched the stupidest movie ever," I replied, saying "the killer's language is not it?" Was it like you knew that? I thought it was like a good movie at the beginning of Freddy Pinhead Melinda I will give him a chance .. I stayed in the rest of this film just because I wrote a column for horror movie reviews. money on time or even brain cells on this ridiculous piece of shit .. run away. If you see it on the shelf at the Hollywood video blockbuster or even the local video store, come back and go .... and still I want to give me two hours back
