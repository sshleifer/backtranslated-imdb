Well, I can and will be very short. This is a wrong-balanced, unconvincing film that could have been a bit better. The script does not seem to know where to go ... from funny to serious ... it's a little foolish. That's too many phrases I've heard before "the hacker is in Florida or not, he's in Madrid, he's not in ... he's screwing up the signal." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
