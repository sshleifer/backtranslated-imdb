Oh, man is a bad movie. It runs horribly. The story is about a racing driver who falls in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken food chain and, while doing so, he does not love himself. He tries to get out of the contract and horrible and painful bad luck. Jim Nabors looks like he's sleepwalker, not actor. You will lose such Burt friends as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed as you watch this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is scary, proving that there were no tons of hair spray in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. Speaking about, Burt's wig was not bad in this movie. The worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and Bandit 2". In any case, this movie is the worst Reynolds movie ever, ever up there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which, fortunately, had no sequel) are great and funny movies. It is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, ruins. You'll be doing a lot of time for a bastard Jackie Gleason that's fun to hate. And remember, it's not one of those fun movies to play. It's just stupid. Even the exits at the end were tedious and boring, and worst of all, unhappy. And at least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first nails to seal Burt's coffin before his years of rebirth later in Boogie Nights, another film that, like Deliverance, quite good then when it has a decent platform to do it.
