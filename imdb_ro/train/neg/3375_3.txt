Hello, Everyone, If you saw "Singing in the Rain," you remember the Gene Kelly scene dancing in the rain. You also remember Donald O'Connor's "Make them em Laugh". If you've seen the "Royal Wedding", you'll remember that Fred Astaire is dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen Jailhouse Rock, you'll even remember the title dance choreographed by the King himself. That's missing here. In this presentation there could have been blockbuster dance numbers. The closest was Chuck McGowan's "I can do that." the simple fact that you have some talented people who are moving together does not make a great dance film. Richard Attenborough was to blame for this failure. He turned the room to the scene and thought it would be a good thing. Audience retaliation for part in a production on Broadway is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as bad if he was in a news or a comedy. It's all right when he's in a Michael Douglas movie, where we see him shouting to someone we'd like to cry. It does not work here. The distribution was good, except for Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to shoot it. The next time I do one of these, I hope they will call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
