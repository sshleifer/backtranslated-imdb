Good performances and direction of art do not make a good movie. This movie is so grim and depressing that I did not feel any joy about the happy ending that involved the trade strike. Humorous attempts involving the burden of the lake are absolutely disastrous, and any film involving a Baldwin brother already strikes against him. On a positive note, Lang is still one of the biggest undervalued Americans, but he almost almost deserves to stay in the VCR. I give myself a 4.
