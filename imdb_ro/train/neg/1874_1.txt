I have been a fiery supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw the short "surviving desire" in high school and, even then, he was still completely blown away by the brilliant Henry Fool. But this 10-year sequel is not just useless but also shameful. After a slow start, "Fay Grim" becomes pseudo-intellectualism, boredom and, ultimately, unjustified - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot. Most of the new faces are as frivolous and under-developed as the movie: a particularly flat character ends up half the time spent with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and is his only scene in the movie! Fulbright's agent, Jeff Goldblum, seems to be the only luminous character (a point of view certainly intended by Hartley). How, then, did he go? ** SPOILER ** He died in a car bombing, making it easy for Hartley's most brutal, violent film so far, and in a totally wrong way in a movie that is already wrong in the word that. <br /> <br /> For the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is Grim?), not to mention herself ... I will not spoil her fate because the movie does a pretty job good for his own (when he does not deal with another sloping angular angle, which gives the inconceivable impression that Hartley moves back from Auteur to a terrible movie student). This piece is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not even good enough to enjoy her misery. Instead, she fully enlivens the typical entertainment claims of his director in the "real world", a more ugly and weaker than necessary, but not nearly ugly or big enough to get close to having something to say. In this sense, Hartley follows all my memories of these people and the wonderful world they originally created for them. I seldom sank to the movies and we count "Leaving Las Vegas," which has developed at least new fresh characters that we grew to love before destroying them, instead of immediately ignoring characters already loved. Grim, really.
