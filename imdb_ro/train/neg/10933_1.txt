Remove every stereotype and distortion you have heard of semi-devoted mormons and you will see that they all played in that ridiculous excuse for a movie. Finally, Kurt Hale's assets have changed (thank you) and hopefully will be a long time before seeing any of his features in theaters. The cinema was amateur (I think they used a video camera for some of the basketball scenes). The plot was clear and very unhappy. You really did not understand why someone did anything. It was like I had sand in my eyes and a 300-pound lady stood in front of her, she was so painful. The only reason I did not give this movie a negative rating was that the ladder would not leave me.
