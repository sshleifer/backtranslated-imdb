I can not believe that this movie did even the video, and that the video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I have requested a reimbursement. Remove the fact that the film has no historical truth, and is still the worst movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called the B rated movie. Do not waste money or time on this movie. Only the voice listing and horrible music made me sick. Everyone involved in this film should be drawn from the union, gives the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this film, I really do not think anyone involved is a member of the union.
