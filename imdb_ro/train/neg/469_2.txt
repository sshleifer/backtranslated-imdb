Mad Magazine could have a lot of crazy people to work for ... but obviously someone there was a good sense when the powers - which would have been rejected by this celluloid waste ... editing is crapo, the intrigue is incredible slim silly ... and the only reason she gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin pulls out some of her clothes and we have a nice shot in my chest ...
