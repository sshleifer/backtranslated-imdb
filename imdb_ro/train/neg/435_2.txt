An old intellectual talks about what art in movies looks like. You give yourself your Hitchcock, Chaplin, your Bergman and other things before the 80's. To disguise that he has no idea what's going on in the cinemas these days, he throws in the Matrix. But it's not just about the same blade-film speeches of all sorts again. This discourse is reduced to outdated psychological plagiarisms: ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte edited in the movies he takes. For someone who should know too much about movies, his own is cinematic: yeiks. To put it in the words of Zizek - I saw 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most crazy idiotic things I've ever heard. At no time in your incoherent answer, you were almost close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now stupid because he listened to it. I give you (two) points (only) and God can have mercy on your soul.
