Believe me, it's a movie you want to avoid, and that comes from a big Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it's about 1/3 of the GREAT movie. The first part of this film makes an exceptional job of establishing the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl she paid to be protected. The trailers on this film mention that she is kidnapped. So, I do not give anything when I say the film is degenerating into an almost undiscovered mess after being kidnapped. Regardless of the director who tries to accomplish, all he could do was make the audience even nauseous. Fast, frenetic and agitated cuts follow for the next half an hour as Creasy follows the descendants. These reductions are so unnatural and nauseous that all they do is to avenge the story. I'm sure the director thought this way of presenting the story meant a change in Creasy's character and meant he was going to follow a different film. Was right. The movie that followed was a complete and unsatisfactory carp. The result is a depressing end that even ruins the quality of the first forty minutes of the movie.
