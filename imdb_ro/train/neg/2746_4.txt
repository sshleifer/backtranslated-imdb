I was afraid to take my grandchildren to this movie because I did not think it would be well done. Children aged 6 to 10 were present, so I succumbed. I have to admit it was not as bad as I thought, but it was still far from the book. The film looked perfect with understanding and sense of humor since the age of 10. We have found that the 6 year olds understood what was happening and presented solutions to the problems that had taken place. Finally, I had to explain that sometimes movies do not present the best solutions to problems, because it is more fun to look at what happens if they make "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
