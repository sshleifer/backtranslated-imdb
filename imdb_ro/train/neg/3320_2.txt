I really had some great expectations when I started watching this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! First, the rhythm is incredibly slow, so it looks much longer than it is (and is not short). I'm sure Jane Austen wrote the book, made it a few long pages, filled it with a description, and did not intend people to read one day, or they might shoot them and lose their appeal , which Emma certainly did. Now "Sense and Sensibility" had this flaw at a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to cope with, and some good performance! That brings me to defect # 2, which is, of course, the act. Although I'm not really interested in this movie, I'm sure they are capable of good work, but I have not seen too much in this movie. It was like people trying too much to be sorcerers, too strong to be "upper class", too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they just came as actors and not as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The distribution, as I said, seemed just like actors, not the people they were playing. Perhaps it's a good thing, because the people they really played on were not so cute. Why everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich and beautiful people in front of them, but there was a terrible gossip behind them. If her friends were "ugly," then they did not even bother to go behind them. So why is this girl so big? Why do people have to say stories, "just to make her laugh?" Of course, the snob could not even make that right. I have quite a lot of problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow and "Emma" did not change my opinion. It's easy to see that I do not care about that. I'm sure it's a great book and everything, but some books are not meant to be made for the big screen, and "Emma" is one of them.
