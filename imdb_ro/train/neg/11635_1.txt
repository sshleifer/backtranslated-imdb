Okay, this is a short and sweet review ... Some film should have taken a practice, made her life shorter and sweeter than she was. This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason why there was a petition with over 40,000 signatures, all of them asking Uwe Boll not to make movies from the franchises he liked. Blood Rayne being a biggie there. The jokes are good ... if you have never heard of them Thousands of times before. The action is descent, but u can only blame the scenario for that. Even a few moments I wonder if I even use a scenario. The movie has nothing to do with the original games. HELLO if you played the games and you know the main character has no real motivation beyond homicide crimes such as mass murder, because he hit his finger with simulation. There's too much story about a movie so stupid. as I said. I would not even have stolen this movie. And for the person who says it's "The Funniest Movie in 2007" .......... we have to take a look around, the news is better than that.
