Gday Mates! just watching the Croc Hunter movie. it was good, but the show seems more real. this seemed just like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with more funny lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described Fangi snakes as those hypodermic. yeeeowch! for real you know it hurts. and can not they jump up? everything got hold of their tail and stuff. There were two major shots in this movie. when Terry discovers that baby joey goes like "We have to take care of it as a child." Wow! I thought he was going to feed the baby. which would have done PG-13 though. At Terry's time, somebody noticed Terry's film and a lot of knowledge about ritual mating. she knows her sex. The film takes place in Queensland, Australia. I want a koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve Sui's dog really has a purpose in this movie. although a small one proves to be useless against the dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if anyone sees this, try to agree with me saying that the fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in the shot with the crocodile. he ate her sheep! And I would be crazy!
