Cut to track, this is one of the five most serious movies I've ever seen. Not that they did not try. There were decent letters, with some elements of structure there, good distribution, good action. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it was terrible. Some elements might have been a bad structure and no background story, a lot to overcome the lead (which is probably much better when it's restricted), some mis-targeting and editing. I had enough hours, I broke my hair about an hour and a half, and very shaken at fifty minutes ran. There was also insincerity about all of this because I went with someone who was heroin-dependent. He was agitated because he was glamorizing something that had nothing good for him. That was supported by the beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old drug addict. And the frantic nature of the leadership was pretty good. There were strange plotpoints that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was unlimited and unfinished (with non-uniform time lines). The characters were colorful, but they did not end up, which made me feel bad about the quality actors you have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Jump over him. I assumed he was a director for the first time who was delighted with his own turds, but he did that before. I am puzzled how this and many other bad ideas find someone who will give him money.
