I was ready to laugh along this movie as a theater experiment in Mystery Science, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many biker friends, and from there decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's often undiscovered. A lot of images of motorcyclists traveling on a dirty road with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is just in the movie. Harmon probably would have done things up. Perhaps he had other commitments on the day he was filmed. Of course, motorcyclists terrorize a small town. Fighting, murder, a cowardly policeman, a bad mechanic, etc. One of the motorcyclists always has a football helmet, a poor attempt to distinguish it from the other bandits. The script has nothing to offer. A scene shows a biker attacking a woman, shouting in front of the lady, "You're the same! You're the same!" We return to the scene a minute later and again say, "You're the same!" Could the writer not think of something more creative to say? Finally, the good boys killed the bad guys. We also find out that the marriage between middle-aged Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and suddenly finds out that Joe's wedding is still activated (but with another bride). The end.
