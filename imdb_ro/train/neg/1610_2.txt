What seemed so curious to me for this movie - I've seen the full 4-hour roadshow, is how unusual it is. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in a gigantic political struggle, is almost totally emotionless. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is the best level 2 actor with a slightly sloping voice) have no drama or depth and basically come to Castro telling Che: Go here, go there without any explanation about the effect or use of this action will result. Odder is still a cast actor who has the power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he was eliminated in a minor part in the second half. Without the tension or passion you would expect to light on these men and their followers, the film becomes an epic film about hairy men and men running through different jungles shouting and shooting without any purpose or purpose. A few of the reviews I've read I've seen boast of the work of director Steven Soderbergh, almost ignoring the actors. (One actually spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital camera than his plot or actors or the fact that he is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a weird and strange thing to do since a) Soderbergh was just a shotgun on the film, and b) it was nothing but a competent work, with an insignificant sign from Oliver Stone's JFK black-and-white cut in the room when Che was visiting New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you'll get an idea of ​​the boring skill of this movie.
