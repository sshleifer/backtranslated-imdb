I had to watch this movie because the intrigue was so scandalous and the movie stayed in expectation. In fact, it sometimes makes a rather uncomfortable viewing. Unlike other Meyer movies, the antique sex is minimized. Some violent scenes are useless and offensive. The story is chaotic, and some of the actors and lines are awful. The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy, combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery and fails in all its aspects. It is as if Meyer attempts to recover sexploitation / black, having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a little guilty of the fact that we've lit up the flagrant connotations of the dominatrix of the early scene, showing Lady Susan with a whip in a provocative suit. He then tries to turn to the right path, turning it into a movie about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other, you do not get anything. Because it is so bad in many ways, it is worthwhile to look at whether you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst case possible. Perhaps, because it's so bad, I almost let Meyer escape with the unacceptable.
