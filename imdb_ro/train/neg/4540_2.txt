At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Indeed boys - this demonstrates the difficulties of a genuine surrender of esoteric problems. I liked the book and I was completely disappointed with the film. It was ridiculous, with half heart and the bad story explained. The novel - first! - he did not have to focus on an adventure! That's just the surroundings. In the film, the focus is on that and the message took a seat in the back! In addition, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and to elucidate the events at the end were parsimonious! They cheated him! ... I will never follow her again!
