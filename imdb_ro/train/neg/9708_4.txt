When a theater employee finds an old coil of the movie, they decide to show it at midnight by screening Night of the Living Dead, assuming it is an old preview coil. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of motionless zombies. I can not understand the hatred for this movie. It is a low budget independent production with lots of camps but does not deserve a "1.1" here on IMDb. It's very funny. It is obvious that movie makers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror films and have created an adorable tribute, sprinkled with references and tributes to a variety of them. She has the feeling of things like "Night of the Living Dead" (in many ways, very similar), "Evil Dead 2" and "The Army of Darkness," and others. I liked the explanation of how zombies, though really hypnotized to think they are zombies, actually got the physical attributes of the dead - perhaps unbelievable, but I appreciate the writers' effort to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the act was fine and the story was fun. I liked.
