I want Spike Lee to choose a different title for his movie. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film refers to serial killer infamous, David Berkowitz. Is not. It is an earthly and earthly portrait of street life in NYC in the hot summer of 77 when Berkowitz terrorized the city. The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to the Son of Threat with Sam. I'm Vinny and Dionna's wife; there are Richie and Ruby and some other characters. The problem is that these characters are not pleasant. They are usually annoying and sometimes unbearable. Then Lee asks for their high energy, chaotic lives, full of anger, lust, and general disorder. There are at least two prolonged battle scenes between Vinny and his wife, scenes cut by disco dance, countless gabfests ... I always wondered: where is the movie editor? Meanwhile, however, in bulk, the movie offers the chance to convey any real feeling of fear or fear that arises from the threat of Sam's Son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing another kind of threat coming from neighboring watchful groups. The actor is equally good. This, combined with 70th disco music and special attention to costumes and production design, makes you feel like you are in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977. The atmospheric authenticity of the film, however, is not enough close to offset a crappy scenario, about the extremely irritated people's lives.
