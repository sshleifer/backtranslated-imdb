I did not like this movie. I thought the actor was not very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer that saves the day? I thought this was just a little taken, even for a movie. I could not figure out why they could not stop him, why not make him a robbery? <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original 80's you expected more than what was actually delivered. This movie could have been a version of the old 21st century movie, it was not. If you want to watch this, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even though the old computer would not have gone back to save the day, it would, in my opinion, be a very brown shot.
