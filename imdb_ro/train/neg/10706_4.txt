Wow and I thought any movie Steven Segal was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get worse, it made me wrong. The story was good, but the actors did not succeed in removing it. They also made a lot of mistakes about how the archival excavations were made. For example, do not manipulate artifacts until they are cataloged and recorded. The biggest crime in casting was the architect. She is a poor actress and I felt she really did the movie less realistic then it was already. The whole Knights Templar concept being underground all these years seemed stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how the things disappeared, so it almost seemed depressing. I thought the characters did not explain themselves quite well. You have not found too many backgrounds and this has made it harder to report them.
