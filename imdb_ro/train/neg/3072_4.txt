Margret Laurence probably did not intend to have any of her novels adopted for the film, not to mention Angel Angel. Hagar, as a character, has constantly provoked social norm (Gainsay who dares, anyone?), And has come close to sacrificing humanity in this process. The symbols in the book (stone angel, silver, etc.) are constant memories of this struggle of the old and the new, and the massacre (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the movie is reasonably believable in the plot of the book (but it's not really a story plot, is it?), I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit film. Hagar's contempt (for the sake of contempt) was not there. Bram could have been far more brutal than portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been more "traditional," so to speak. If the filmmaker were to insist on stronger portraits, the film would point straight to the house. Along the same direction, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other upgrades? We try to make some points to make some points (for example, the Muslim girlfriend and the indigenous people). Hagar and co. are everything, but politically correct in the book, why do we see this in the movie version. Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using this right as an excuse to send correct political subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems to throw punches under the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also the audience. We seem to have been conditioned to see old, bitter, old people. Why should he laugh every time Hagar is beaten? I doubt that Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and angry and all we do is laugh at them. I do not think Hagar and others in her situation were right.
