He laughed a lot - because he is so incredibly bad - good people, but certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, but anyway: actors behave like to play in a soap, dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I saw such strange shots was at a trash at a youth video festival ten years ago. I very much appreciate the fact that people are gathering and filming cheap movies, but at least a certain quality should be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were intriguing silent and they looked good - and the score really deserved to be heard. Covering the DVD has promised a lot, but that's by far the best movie he can offer ...
