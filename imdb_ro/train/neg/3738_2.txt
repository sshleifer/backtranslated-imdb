That is why this title should be, anyway. This film combines weapons, explosives and mindless killing to make a flop of an action movie. Allow me to highlight a series of questions: answer type hill. What's happening in the movie? People die. Is that what? Yes. What it is? What plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point of trying to make the movie? Killing is the only solution. What are the characters? Extremely erroneous and contradictory to their own personalities. Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some beautiful Panavision cameras to shoot them. If you like constant killing and greed, then watch the movie. If you happen to be rejected by such low-level "entertainment" then "Made Men" is not for you. To summarize, the plotlines go out, the characters do not deserve the time, the story is completely resilient, and nothing fits together. This proves one thing: the actors, the directors and those who helped make this film are certainly not "made".
