This film is one reason the IMDB should allow a 0/10 vote. The acting is terrible, even what some have appreciated here, the character of the Carpathians! Script seems to be written in a hurry. In one scene, the black preacher who was left behind when asked by Buck, which meant "dan7" in the computer chart, said: "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER 24." Probably wanted to say VERSE 24, but filmmakers missed this slip. Perhaps the worst is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically uncertain. While many Christians supported the film's interpretation of the events at the end of time, such an interpretation, in my opinion, * is flawed. To understand these defects, read "Christians Will Go Through Trouble" by Jim McKeever and "The Holiness of Hope, a Biblical Study of the Second Coming and Abduction" by George E. Ladd.
