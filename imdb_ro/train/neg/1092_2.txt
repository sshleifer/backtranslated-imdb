I guess the good news about 2001's "The Double-D Avenger" opposite William Winckler is that he manages to unite three of the miracles of Russ Meyer's mammals - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven from Croix - in a single photograph. (I can only assume Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot it ... or else they could see a copy of the script beforehand!) The bad news, though (and there is a a lot of) is that this movie - if it can even be called as, after being shot directly to the video - is a total breath, a total abortion, an exaggerated atrocities, absolute abominations, and indeed one the worst images I've ever seen. Do not look at the smallest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, as it happens, deals with the appropriation of the superpowers by Kitten after being recovered in South America to heal breast cancer (oy) and fought later with a trio of megalung bikini dancers in LA. the joked joke falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, there is actually nudity NOT in reality (except for some old photos of Kitten in the glory period) and that a shaving cream and a paper-mache are the sum total of the special course. Meyer buckets are long in the tooth / sages in the chest to offer them with kindness, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, like a bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Manages to have fun. So why did I give this juvenile, unpleasant, unsuccessful misunderstanding of a 2-star movie instead of 1? Let's be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs. His vocal commentary on the special features of the DVD that I have just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he draws around 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from the 1,000+ on his Web site " Canonical Hooters List ". Man is a national treasure and he manages to upgrade this skeet from a disc to coaster status!
