The young and attractive Japanese people are meeting again, this time involving mobile phones. Various people die until the dissatisfied spirit behind them is dug up, so essentially if you've seen more than two recent Japanese horror films, you can make this movie in the dark with your tied hands. The attraction here is that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Until now, I was more impressed with his weak key works such as City of Lost Souls, however, as a Missed Call, over time, I had the desire to push my Dead or Alive or pseudo -Cronenberg of Audition. Despite the fact that many of his films are essentially naked, at least they deserve these or at least something to keep an eye on as Tadanobu Asano, who prepares in glamorous costumes that interpret Johnny Depp. There is none of these in a lost call; there is very little credit: the act is gentle and medium, there is very little (nothing, with all honesty) in the way of scaring or suspense, and in its places it is simply boring. , there are moments in which Miike's sense of humorous sentiment sneaks through gentle commercialism; especially on the occasion of the television show that intended to film the death of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer was more concerned with his assessments than with the girls' lives. But besides, there is nothing to suggest that Miike is behind the room; most notably, the usual visual flair has disappeared without a trace (and including its famous gore), although it is more likely that he had no enthusiasm for the project and understood why. A missed call is not offensive to bad. It's just frustrating about the media. Miike obviously loves the director. With great annual output, it is obvious that he will not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even in this sense, a Lost Call felt she was paying only the bills.
