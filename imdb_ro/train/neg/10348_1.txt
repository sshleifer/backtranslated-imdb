I was very excited to see they ever made a movie in my favorite book. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was frightened by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a film from a report of the fourth grade book on the novel. Meg did well in school, and she and her father did not wear glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed at all as a scientist; they left their kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And this is only the beginning. By the middle of the movie, I woke up shouting on the screen, much to the desperation of the others watching the movie that did not read the book. I would have liked to have more fingers to give four fingers for that. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is fine.
