Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" I bought at Walgreens for a whole big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a well-spent dollar or a scattered dollar. Pretty amazing set of drawings and costumes. Apparently, much thought and effort began to make them. Drawings are very Mexican in stylization. I liked very much. And Santa's impressive. One of the most impressive Santas in moviedom. I think the original intention and purpose of this film was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. But, in a way, it is quite disturbing. In fact, I was amazed at how disturbed it is. Perhaps dubbing in English seems to be so disturbing and bizarre. One of the reasons why I prefer to shoot in the original language has been made and the use of subtitles in English as dubbing often gives an unintentional strangeness. The child's voices were at least doubled by the voices of real children, unlike the women who pretended to be children, who tended to sound very, very strange. Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? Did not you do it? Not until I watched this movie. One learns something new every day. Is this movie worth watching? Now, that's a problem. I can not, in good conscience, recommend anyone, because it is bizarre enough. However, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worthwhile. You decide what you will do. I do not know ... for me, they made me feel uncomfortable seeing the demons constantly making nice ballet moves. Now, that's wrong ...
