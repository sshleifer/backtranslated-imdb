LOC could have been a very good film about the way the Kargil war took place; they had the locations, the budget and the ability to be "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down" in India. Instead, she meets like a 4-hour starvation in an attempt to combine the war with the masseuse. Even the war scenes were executed terribly, using the same hill in all battle scenes and spending time unnecessarily on occasional discussions. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian audience, a better film would have been an account of what happened at Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time at the military point (such as " Torah, Torah, Torah "). Even better, he could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, edit and edit the movie. Until then, I would love to see some of them re-editing this film, with only the portions included; would make the movie more visible.
