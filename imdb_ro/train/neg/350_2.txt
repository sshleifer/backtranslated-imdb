Fishbourne's performances (which seem strangely funny in a way) and Ed Harris (remarkable) are remarkable, unlike Connery, which does not seem to make sense in his role and reaches the driving behavior of an 80-year-old man for years. Actually the script does not make sense; Imagine 60 minutes. happy end-plot plus a sudden turn of the turn without any argumental structure on the characters. It is more an accident than a scenario and it can be good for screen-wrights screening purposes. The more you recall the details, the stronger this impression becomes. Capital punishment is not a problem here, although it is a matter from the beginning; it fades away without any comments. Object and environment could have been good.
