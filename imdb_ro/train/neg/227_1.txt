Was that a serious comedy or drama? The film begins with a banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are some antiquities between them. Fine. But when the plot thickens and finally gets black, I start wondering if I misinterpreted the first part of the film. She continues to do so for a while, until, finally, she tries to return to her open heartbeat. But so far it's too late. It's hard to see why these women will talk to each other and the final is not convincing. Truly a lesson (anyway, for British producers) not to make movies. Difficult to see how producers would have ever convinced that this movie would work. And the box office turned out to be a real flop because I never heard of this movie until this weekend (four years since launch).
