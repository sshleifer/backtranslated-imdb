One of the silliest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable comedy of haunted houses with music with Kay Kyser. Kyer, the leader of the orchestra and the radio star (and the eternal college of goof-off brotherhood), was a kind of precursor to Spike Jones, reconciling for his guests, and volunteered by his cheerful band of musicians. He is hired to play an anniversary party in a gloomy mansion, like the poison darts imported from Africa are hung and hung on the wall. Shindig is impressed by a creepy judge, a frightening teacher, a threatening swami, a lot of strange females and jokes quite unpleasant to fill three pictures of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to face, and Kyser is not too confident, making him with a ribbed elbow material that returns in the 1940s back in ten years. * from ****
