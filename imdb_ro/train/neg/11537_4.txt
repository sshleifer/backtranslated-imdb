I've watched the progress of the movies for a while, so she had expected a little too much. I think that both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they are doing and are interested in seeing what Dan Reed can do, but unfortunately he just did not go for me. the fact that the film does not seem to really understand the genre it falls into and, as such, fails to impress on elements of drama, horror, and thriller, because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well, all the craft and masters of nobody. The premise (as in the case of revenge films) is simple, the couple meets and goes out, something bad happens and takes revenge, is a simple formula and one that many executives have manipulated the expertise over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, Dan Reed thought, "It would be great to make one of those films revenge that goes deeper, showing a more humane part to all the characters and pulling more into their mental state ..." Wrong ! There are also some missing key elements, in this type of film there is generally a kind of warning. Do not do this, or this can happen as an element that adds to tension, but there is nothing like it here. It just happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. There is a lot of very rigid competition in this genre and Dan Reed's hats for my attempt, I have no problem with his targeting abilities, but within writing ... I would say next time he should stay on formula for the type of movie he makes instead of trying to be too smart and he will have a quality film on his hands.
