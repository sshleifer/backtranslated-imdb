Yes, well, I was certainly sorry to give up on Saturday night watching this weird, but still very long movie. Apparently, the main character did not steal two hours of my life. Here's the example of the anti-hero in "Do not regret." We have this robbery, so wandering, so wandering, so selfish, devoid of target and untouchable that it was extremely difficult to get over the attraction of a businessman, Jaemin, unless it was just an attraction physics. He says otherwise it is love. But after watching this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you dug his beard. (Well, it's not that bad, but there are still no real features yet.) I could never get over why Jaemin had no Sumin strains anymore. It has never been proved, just said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It has to be, because a little more than half of the movie is one that follows the other and the last part is tracking back and forth to the point where I thought this turned into a screwdriver comedy. I waited for a tiger called "baby" to make an appearance. Okay, so Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so good someone who's trying to improve. But after his first taste of his stalker, he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. What the? OK, well, as mentioned above, obsession does not stop due to job / career change and if you throw a bunch of other very angry characters, you get a disturbed movie where unbelievable happenings seem to happen without accumulating . The basic movie is not 100% terrible, but you can do better with gay films.
