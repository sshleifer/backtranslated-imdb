... but I regret seeing him. Since the ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and must have been relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in my queue because it is published as a gentle comedy in the UK, a category that has produced many movies that I really liked. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of laughless comedies, usually populated by Hollywood movies produced and directed by those without talent. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress and I liked it in other movies. The concept - a marijuana grower to overcome the shortage she faces after her husband's death - does not hurt me. Despite the intense efforts of the cast to produce humor, the film collapses on the face (falling down on his ass would have been more fun) as long as I and my wife were. Be warned, oh, gentle reader, not all successful British comedians succeed. This is a dud.
