In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we find that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer sleeping with fancy wireless underwear for the murder of his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from a newsstand and praising after a crazy young man who meets the train station. And he's the hero of this great movie that's dressed (except Krabbe in at least one scene too many), but he has no place to go. The basic terrain is very simple, but it is dragged almost two hours before it reaches an unnecessary conclusion. Verhoeven has a pleasant visual flair, but uses scenes of wild hallucinations, obvious symbolism, and free gore when he loses his ideas.
