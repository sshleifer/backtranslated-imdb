I saw Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and never liked the show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, I'm sorry if I'm looking for it, but that's actually what I think) . Many people liked it, but I did not. The characters at school seemed to fight all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were nice to each other frequently, but they were gradually tired of Arthur's complaining attitude to everyone and DW's sister (however, the name DW was a 4-year-old Arthur's sister, ADHD (or ADD), who sometimes demanded her routine, such as her imaginary friend and stuffed animal collection, etc.), Arthur's friends acted as teenagers instead of what they were in Arthur's books, and parents, they did not care too much. <br /> <br /> The greatest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
