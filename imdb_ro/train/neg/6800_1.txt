I just signed to comment on how horrible this movie is. Besides being a decision of the Executive or Air Force One or another kind of terrorist story, this is a movie that makes you appreciate that you see a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid scenario with cliches to work with them. It's bad if you twin once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you're groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director is also not the brightest bulb in the cinema business , nor are they the producers for the decision to bring this story to the screen first. Most likely, low-paying players can apologize for taking over this task because they most likely appeared to get money and exposure, not that being part of this movie joke will win any prize or recognition. It might be embarrassing to have such a bad judgment to get involved in such a loser. I do not understand anything in summarizing the plot or even giving any examples to prove it to me, for to do so would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one could resist in this disaster. As you study the well-done films, you can inspire how to make a beautiful and well-crafted artwork together, the beauty, the only thing you can learn to watch is to do what you do not have to do and what does NOT work! Be warned.
