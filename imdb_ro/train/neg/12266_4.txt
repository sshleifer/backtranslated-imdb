The Republic Republic's images are late at play at Werecat Werecatcher. The pleasure has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad, during which he developed the fear of the jungle, during which he had interruptions. He comes to great recognition, because his novel, which is parallel to an infamous process, is a best seller. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, which seems more likely when an official is killed by a "catman". Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fianc√© ends dead. The complicated problems are the return of the interruptions, so the writer does not know whether he is the killer or not. The good thriller is far too relaxed for you to fully enjoy. There are too many musical numbers over time and too much dead time when things all speak in the middle and subsections. The actor is fine and the sets are pretty good, but there's a reason why most people I know just to remember the top killer, he's the most exciting thing in this movie. Despite the short running time (just over an hour), I think the reason why this movie was rarely seen on television was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with him. As well as speaking, I wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened in the closing minutes, it was too little too late. Make a pass.
