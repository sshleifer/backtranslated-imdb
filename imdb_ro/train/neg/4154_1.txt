Vampiri vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was actually ... Lesbian Nasty semi-vampires and two zombies hit by cars: Special guest guests of Bob Lesbian Gypsy-Witch and her dog, Random Woman with special powers and Catholic School The short girl of the zombie choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: Not Plot - Only the writer and the director will understand the end, or something else in this movie. Seriously, though, I love bad movies. I like vampires. I like zombies. Hell, I really enjoy lesbians. This film combined all three with a vague and confusing (or nonexistent) plot, a horrible dialogue (ie REALLY BAD), and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with (or not ... I do not have I know what's happening in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the "Zombies" oatmeal from latex gloves (yes, movie makers were so cheap they could not even cover their Zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). In any case, the result was this exclamation of BAD film, if you could even call it that way. <br /> <br /> The end should have made no sense? Was the vampire really a nurse, and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where Was Vampire Vs. Zombies? Hell, where the vampires were ... you could not call any of the girls vampires. Regardless. <br /> <br /> Never rent this movie. If you're really curious ... well, I'll understand. Seriously, even BAD movie lovers will not be able to stand. It should be number one at the bottom 100.
