The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possesses the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in the Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious. Apart from the typical comedy Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I can not see anything positive about this movie. The story shows the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that the long shot from Anil Kapoors is the smallest mistake made by the director. Except for Tashan directors to make this film there is no other Tashan. I regret to lose my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it zero.
