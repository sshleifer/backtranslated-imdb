This is simply bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they deviate from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This was just as badly thought out and performed as it can be. This was not even good standing. Viggo Mortenson is a top actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects left something to be desired. The original "point of escape" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not at all pleasant or fun. This was done from a film-based approach, filling in the plot points that someone in Hollywood thinks they will like what they see as a public today. Basically, I see them as idiots. It is insulting that someone will put this as a feature film, and will even try to remake a classic worship this sloppily. Manipulating plot devices, "making it obvious-so-have-not-miss-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur direction ... stupid harm ....
