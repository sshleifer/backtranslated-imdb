This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "home assignment" for a movie class. It is completely branded when it comes to the "message" is TRYING at the relay. Characters are exaggerated, act stupidly and as a plot ... and it's ridiculous. The cover is what made me think it could be a decent film, the co-actor is nice and that's about it. Moral of this film: NEVER NEVER REMEMBER A FILM FROM THE WORLD! Save yourself time, money and energy and create your own home movie and you will be much better than me. It was painful to look and honestly I am surprised that someone would spend money to make and distribute it!
