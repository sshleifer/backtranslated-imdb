They rarely make these observations, but I felt compelled to spare others the pain that I endured in watching this film. It is so stupid and implausible in both the general story and the details that you simply can not suspend from unbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher working in a new Porsche and sleeping with his team in a rest that looks like a castle overlooking Washington Capitol Building, D. C. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! Only gets worse. Towards the end, when the bad guy starts killing the good guys, the last group acts so badly you want to die to clean the pool. The special effects are pretty good - any manufacturer's bank can buy it - and the top actors were great in other movies, but the script and the direction are moronic. Many people have wondered if there is some deliberate information behind the previous films made by Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop the questions. It's very bad.
