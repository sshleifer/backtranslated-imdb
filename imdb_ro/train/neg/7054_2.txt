This movie was absolutely pathetic. A sloppy scenario and the lack of any story left me staring at three wicked people who have fallen over bikinis. Sometimes I thought I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit around the movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only useful part of the film is Anu Malik's puppet and his obsession about shayaris. He was pretty hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and his version of remix were very good. You can always rely on Emran's lip and lip-synching. On the whole, it seems Emran does not have a good script from Bhatts to support him this time.
