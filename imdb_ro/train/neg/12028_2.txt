I agree with all the above who have said everything that will convince you not to miss even a short period of time watching this amateur movie. Very low value production values, the total pedestrian direction, and such a novel and inertial scenario that they should never have been written, no longer produced. Even Hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a salary, though no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should take place instead of ending this inconsistent disorder. OTH, there is something fascinating about seeing something so towering. And Chad Lowe is terrible and constantly evil.
