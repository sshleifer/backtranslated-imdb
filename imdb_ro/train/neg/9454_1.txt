When my child asks me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to get my eyes out. I wanted to get through the screen and hit Mike Myers because he had sacrificed the last kind of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies of my life that I have watched and I immediately wanted to "give" if it was possible. The other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious," both of which are better than those nonsense in the hat. I may be able to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I have ever seen this blasphemy on Seuss's good name. For Mike Myers, I say a stick with Austin or even Waynes World revival. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians
