Everyone who wants to be an editor needs to watch this movie! It shows you about any mistake not to do in editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's so bad that I can not write a sentence without the exclamation mark!) If the first episode of "Les Visiteurs" was a good family comedy with fun jokes and worship dialogues, this sequel copies badly from the first. Funny pieces could be counted on one side and maybe half of them. Clavier overcomes his role even more than in the first part, Robin tries to behave like Lemercier (because he replaces it), but that's "grotesque." Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even though Muriel Robin can be fun on stage, he is not in this movie because he does not act the way he did. I know it would be hard to replace someone who was good in a role (Lemercier won a César award for her role in the first film), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, Lemercier role '! As for the story, it's too much! Of course I knew at the end of the first film that it would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier would have tried to write a simple story like the first episode. Gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, indeed, there are no more than 3 funny parts in this. The only good things could be the costumes and some special effects. So you only have two reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit a terrible movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a "huge moment"! 2/10
