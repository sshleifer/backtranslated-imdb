A demented science girlfriend is beheaded, so she gets her head back to life. Frankly, this is the screenplay of the movie. He's trying to bring another body he's looking for through the sleaze area of ​​the city for that perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly monster in the cabin cabin. The upset style of the movie is ridiculous. No one in the movie can actually act, including the head. The wardrobe monster is a man with a mask tie and you can even tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so badly done. Watch the version of this Mystery 3000 Science Theater movement. Believe me I will not watch this movie alone.
