I have seen this not long ago and I have to say: this movie is terrible. I'm watching awesome movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. Scarecrow is bad. You have an incredibly hateful villain who enjoys cries of terrible blows when he kills his victims (actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). He has his lucky story he uses to justify his crimes. "Everyone thinks of me, the only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer, he likes one of the guys who take me, I want to kill everyone, OK, I'm exaggerating, but the premise of this movie is enough to put it close to the bottom of the list of awesome movies. Adding to what I just said, the baby's mother is promiscuous, she enters her mother and her current boyfriend takes over, the mother's friend tells her to leave, the kid refuses, insisting she will not leave of his house The boy turns the kid in the field of corn He kills a baby right in front of his mother, mother screaming in terror, the friend is like, "OMG! I did not want to. "Then she tells her mother not to say anything about the police, but Kid was killed under a scarecrow, though, so that any child who is killed under a scarecrow returns like a murderous scarecrow with a vengeance. its "have not been tracked like this before ..." (The official scarecrow label) <br /> <br /> To make things worse, this movie was filmed in an 8-day I was going to give this movie a 2, because despite having one or two redeeming moments. (There are spoilers, so I will not hurt it for you if you really want to see the crap I could forgive somewhat bad acting, horrible special effects, abisal scenario and unfavorable camera work, but I simply have no respect for the lack of effort at this level. good as I do. If you want to see an example of how to n u make a movie or if you like to watch bad movies like me, then watch this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay a safe distance from this movie at any time.
