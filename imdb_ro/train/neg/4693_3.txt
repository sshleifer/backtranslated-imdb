This is exactly the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, excellent director, great story potential, then destroy everything with a scenario that does not go anywhere ... and say nothing while going there! There is no depth here. No depth of character, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, suspense, or common sense. We know what's going on, we're told how he intends to fix the problem, solve the problem, cast us a surprise to the end that does not generate suspense, then ends the movie suddenly. The possibility of losing. In addition, Glenn Ford is leading a cast of actors in the UK (and a Frenchman) who are all fantastic, doing an incredibly impressive work with the one-dimensional writing they have received. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie," which offers some wonderful pieces of humor and warmth in a dark and serious film. I also thought the movie had a great look at him ... all the shadows and the fog ... very nevralnick√° film. <br /> <br /> Even if the actors do everything they can and the direction is nice, it is not enough for me to recommend spending the time to watch the movie. There are much better Glenn Ford movies: Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
