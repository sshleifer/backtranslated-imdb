Horror / Sci-Fi that is interesting because it's ridiculous. F / X pretty good ... for what you can see. A thriller for television that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant scientist, though misguided, stunning with stem cell research and manipulating human DNA with that of a hammer shark. Terrible results give birth to a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the new brilliant experiment. Of course, after laughing and stunningly ... Coombs' creation, by the way of his son, coupled with a hammer, is allowed to hunt his father's colleagues one by one. Revenge is not always enjoyable. Also in the distribution: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
