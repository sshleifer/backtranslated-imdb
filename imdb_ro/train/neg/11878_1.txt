Indeed, when it comes to it, this movie is not even funny. Josh Kornbluth is a funny ante, and yet he thinks he's hilarious. The plot of sending the 17 letters was good at the beginning, until Josh's "Look at me, I'm crazy" approach began to infect every scene. Judas's judgment may be the least funny thing I've ever had, and that's what she says pretty much, because she has a fierce competition from the other jokes in the movie. And as to the incredible excess of Pixies' Debaser, I only have one thing to say: What did Pixies ever do to deserve a fate like that? What did Josh Kornbluth do to make him write / direct / produce / stay in such a terrible movie?
