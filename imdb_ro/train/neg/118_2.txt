This is a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He relied on his life, but he changed things around the characters who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. He sounds more like a millionaire playboy director than a detective, is not he? The whole movie was written by Peter and shows how far he was with real people. You should write what you know and he really did. And leave the audience bored and confused, and jealousy, for that. This is a curiosity for those who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was killed right after the shooting. But Patti Hanson, who will marry real life with Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but he is much better and has a bigger share. In fact, Stratten's part seemed to be forced; added. It does not have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated to get started. Generally, every character in this movie is a person with whom very few people can bind unless you are a millionaire in Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snoring event. That's when you stop touching. Have fun with some jokes inside and wear the rest.
