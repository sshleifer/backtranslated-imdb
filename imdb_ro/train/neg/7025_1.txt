I would like to be able to give this movie a zero or even lower, because, unfortunately, that's worth it. I honestly never leave a movie, but it was so terrible that I could not stay for another minute. Please, please, for the sake of humanity, skip this movie. If you want a lesbian movie that really suits you, that's not the case. It has unattractive, unattainable leadership, tangled structure, ridiculous dialogue and is absolutely unconvincing in any imaginable way. At an absolutely fundamental level, he does not manage to have fun. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so scenic, it's LIGHT than any student movie I've seen. As if this were not enough, the entire film is based on the constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over the narrative. The writer of the writing could have written a novel, because they insisted on saying everything instead of EVERYTHING. We must assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, even if there is no character development to illustrate this. Also, this movie continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in a frozen frame of characters, with their names written on the screen. There is no introduction or development of any of the characters. We do not know each other at all. This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. I'm a homosexual woman who watched this movie with my roommate (another homosexual woman) and we both found the film as a depressing depiction of the queer cinema. I'm beginning to think lesbian and homosexual movies are very similar to Christian rock - no matter how awesome it is, people will continue to face it and promote it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, encourage the production of Gay and Lesbian QUALITY films by renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Creatures of the Heaven" instead of swallowing any mindless curse that they follow to the Queer as Folk, .
