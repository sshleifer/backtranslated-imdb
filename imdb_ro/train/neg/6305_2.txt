This is a wonderful story and it was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on that). However, despite being true, it's still a movie and this is a movie. I realize that independent movies have difficulties in getting good actors, but wow. The only, even mediocre, is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate all the actors (including the one who played him as a young man) acting absolutely atrocious. The scenario was terribly clich√©, but even then you need to get some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anyone because it is so badly done in each category. Read some books about the true story of S. Mason, because I give these men the respect they deserve.
