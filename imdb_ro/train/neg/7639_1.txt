I saw this movie at the Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in NY and I thought it was bad enough. The first and most distracting was the way he was shot; that is, a lot of slow and too moving movements that seemed to have no point - a wise or aesthetic story - other than to show the skills of the cinematographer (who I think he was also the director). This movie seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with. The main actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but the best actor was mediocre; and the rest of the distribution varies from so-so to bad. The story itself was predominantly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most of the public seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but I did not like it too much.
