It can handle historical inaccuracies, but this movie was too much. Practically, nothing was even close to the truth, and even for the time, it was seen as foolish. In Brod's defense, he was revealed in an old talk show that he was acting on the story as he told the real Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, and resumed the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the scenography and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach's arrival, so despite what other historians say, Wyat himself says he was premeditated. This film portrays Earp as a honest man, but also his brothers. History does not say exactly that they were or were not. Most people prefer to interfere a little bit of deception and lawlessness in their characters, but it is nothing new. Truth is probably closer to them being the ways that follow the GUNFIGHT at OK CORRAL law. The men who saw her as a career and believe me in the Old West, you did not have time to think too much about something else. Characters that do not exist, picture characters dying at the corral that really do not, all make this film weaker. It is still weakened by Mature, who really did not make a convincing DOC. Perhaps it is the worst choice for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that the older movies were closer to the epoch and closer to the sense of truth. After all, ford got information from Wyatt Earp. It is also weakened by all the predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro-Nazi in those days and was about to kill the brunette women in a very predictable way to show the patronage of Hitler's idealism. This is the case in most movies until the eighties. There is no excuse and yet cheap art. The actors playing at Earps feel good and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, Mature can be the only downside that acts in this movie. However, it is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
