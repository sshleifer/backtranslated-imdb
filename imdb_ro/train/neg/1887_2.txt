Earlier today I came to an argument that so many people are complaining about modern movies in which I have encountered a curious statement: "the development of character in newer movies is not as good or as interesting as it was." Depending on the movie (s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and hollywood-led plot, such as War of the Worlds, but in the case of uninterrupted trials, a social commentary and a desperate struggle to bring "art" back to cinema, are films such as the Dog Days that are to blame. Normally, I have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or useless you find them (from the good ones, like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to the ones that I felt painful to sit in, an alpha dog and Wild West Wild). I closed the film in 45 minutes, which means 30 minutes longer than I should have. I did not care about any of the characters and found nothing essentially beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dangers of society, this film too easily becomes self-indulgent, tribe, and exploiter in a very sincere sense. However, I have seen many disturbing films on the same subject, but there are many better movies about depressed, pathetic (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters of deep emotional personality. The days of the dogs had only a disapproval for society, the eighth clerk, choosing to ignore any real intelligence about how people are in reality and, instead, to choose to be a dull, terrible and hopeless attempt in a work art". This is not a characterization of the unknown or an intelligent observation in the drains of society, it is just boring and nothing worth taking care of.
