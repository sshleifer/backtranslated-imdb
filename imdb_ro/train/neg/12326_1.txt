A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (Eric Brown). They do sex ... but everything is related to a stupid plot or something. Easily one of the most disturbing sexual comedies ever. Does anyone know this movie makes light of child molestation? I suppose it's good because it's a teenage boy - if we had one with a man seducing a teenager, it would (justifiably) be an indignation. I'm sorry, but if I made a boy an excuse. He's still sick. I realize that Brown was old (in fact, he was 18 years old when he was done), but LOOKS 15. I find it worrying that some people find this right. - but can not act, Brown is easily one of the worst actors of the child I've ever seen), and constant nudity becomes boring and not even erotic from a distance. a theater back in 1981. I was 19 years old and my 14-year-old cousin (who could walk 18 years). He wanted to see it - I did not, but I decided what the hell? I went in and bought, in fact, tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously minors. My cousin thought it was boring and the other three kids left halfway! Let me make this clear - three TEENAGE boys left a movie with tons of feminine nudity! This should give you an idea how bad this is. I'm surprised he was ever released. 1 all the way.
