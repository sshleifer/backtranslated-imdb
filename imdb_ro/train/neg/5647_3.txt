I bought this series on DVD because of all the reviews I've seen here. I gave it three stars because there is no doubt that sometimes act, direction and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that I have not seen the propaganda that has been transmitted so well in series. If anyone follows it with discernment, it will see the entire litany of radical right beliefs promulgated by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid the destruction of any spoilers, I will refrain from highlighting all dozens of specific instances. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will reveal that everything, from torture to gun control, to the right of a network to give "Infomercials" and to name them news, is justified by creepy breaths of plot and impassioned speech by some of the best actors in the world. I watched many shows and eventually gave up disgust when they justified torture using General Prosecutor Gonzales as a brilliant example of why all kinds of torture should be used on behalf of everyone's protection. The series also manages to confront male and female homosexuals in subtle ways, using them as plotting devices describing bad men. Everything in all the radical litany of radical religious justice. Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America has lost its way in the first part of this century. As a student of history, I would characterize this program as being in a league with Goebbels propaganda for Hitler and part of Hollywood propaganda for the American audience during the Second World War. you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how profoundly subtle propaganda can be by all means. Just make sure you buy a cheap copy so you can avoid enriching those on the right of the Faux Network that produced this travesty.
