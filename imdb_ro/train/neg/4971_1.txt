I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with just a few copies, these are the kinds of movies the Sci-Fi channel looks like. A kind of film that no one ever wants, and only ten tenants when I bring it back, I ask them "it was good," they say, "I did not stop it after 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible computer generators, super-impotent monsters, and so unnecessary. This is the same type of film that Grendel has and the absolute loss of time if you reasonably (and only reasonably) want a good film based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who plays , also in the expected 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta. Plus, later this year we have another Beowulf movie star starred by Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. But do not leave your hopes the way we did with Eragon, or we're all in for another big disappointment. As for renting, here is my rule: if there is only one or two children, do not rent it because it is a load of nonsense (it's true 99.9% of the time, it's usually not true if the title is alien or a documentary.)
