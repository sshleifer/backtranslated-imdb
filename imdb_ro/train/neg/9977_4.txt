This kid is pretty bad, but in no way makes him the guy who shines the adults and can prevent the experienced thieves at every step. No, he is not so bracket because he is a child with serious emotional problems. A beautiful couple who tries to adopt, is rather suckered in his adoption and while the husband is more willing to give this child a chance mother is not. Through a bizarre character Michael Richards and Gilbert Gottfried always annoying and you have a bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. I actually prefer this sequel to this movie because I like the fact that they have brought Amy Yasbeck back as another more enjoyable character because there are many characters in this movie that are totally impossible to appreciate. Even the baby is quite annoying at first in this, and they will continue to cool down. Crying is simple enough, although prospective parents are going to adopt that child whom they consider great by the way the orphanage throws a party as they leave, and soon they realize they have a small mercenary. Add to that little hellion that comes in contact with a convict of some sort. I'm not sure about this character, at first I thought he should be his real dad or something like that. Not everything is good, but I'll pick it up before that Culkin child every day of the week.
