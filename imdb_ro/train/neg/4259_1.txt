I did not know anything about this movie before I was convinced to see him from a friend who heard that it was a "non-stop fight age from start to finish". That could not have been beyond the truth. This was one of the most boring, badly drafted, amateur, horror films I've ever had the misfortune of looking at me. I would class there with the movie I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. In principle, there is no story, it is hard to believe that the producers of this film believed that this stupidity with cheeses would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It's also one of the most serious dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little jewel ... Guy says the girl "smell like moon". The girl answers "What smells the moon?" I DO NOT BELIEVE! You gotta fuck me! The scene in which the guy was drawn and folded had some good laughter from the audience because he looked so ridiculously inexpensive and the FX sound of the guy that was torn apart reminded me of someone who made a farting sound . If this is happening in a theater near you, avoid it at any cost. This movie is so bad that I actually took the decision of about 45 minutes to get me to sleep ... and I did. Awful.
