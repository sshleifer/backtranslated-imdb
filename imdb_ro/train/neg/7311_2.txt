Okay, I heard a little about this movie, so when I came to the TV channels on television, I wanted to look at him, being an angry actor. I think I can make a collective "huh?" for everyone who watched it. I decided to move away with my life, but at a party with my closest friends I saw it coming and some of us saw that we already decided to laugh through us, both proclaiming "this is the worst thing on which I have ever seen. " He was not scary; I give it to Roth (who thinks he's a young hack); characters change over the movie, "Cube". However, despite the typical "rat in a box" scenario, who will start who, etc., was the average horror. > <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with that rifle? I do not even talk about him being strange and biting people. I'm talking about the whole "slow-moving karate movement," which was that? 2.) Okay, I know that Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young man I was terrified that she just went and molested her in her sleep. That's illegal. 3.) Roth was in the movie, so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about meaningless writing! 4.) What was with the MP? 5.) So she was immediately pushed by the dog? And there's little blood left? Just a piece of her jeans? Anyway, we got out of our ass and I like to laugh at the Dead of Dead, but I do not know if we should have laughed here ...
