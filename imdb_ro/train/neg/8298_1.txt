This movie was not really fun, certainly NEVER as original or just as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors and fail. Neighbors on the hills come from nowhere because they are not part of the first film. This really suffocated, it could have been good with the original piece, then again maybe not because the story is so feeble. Move on.
