ALL FOR LOVE is a Romantic drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in the Napoleon army, captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young girl visiting the prison. There is also a story that involves a crime. I will be honest and confess that I was not too busy with the film, because I do not really have a fan of the drama of the epoch and the script feels somewhat episodic, but I will say that this is well done by all those involved and has a good distribution on who have Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The design costume, as you can expect, is also excellent <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this movie does not get any complaints after it was broadcast on BBC2 to teatime. Captain Saint Ives is in bed with a prostitute in which a nipple is fully exposed and there is a scene of escaping French prisoners that includes full masculine front nudity, not to mention a crime scene in which blood is seen clear. You really have to worry if BBC planners have any clue what they are doing
