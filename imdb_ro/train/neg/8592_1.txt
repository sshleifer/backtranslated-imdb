To make a movie that stretches from the preques and from the "real" Star Wars trilogy, it would even impose a great filmmaker. Lucas is not that film maker. To describe the fall of a Good Man in the Dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring, with only a few lightweight pockets, but there is a lack of edge because you already know what the main characters survive in the original side wars. Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very passive role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks silent! <br /> <br /> It is not only the Chancellor who turns to the Jedi and has a big sequence (overpassed) at the lava falls
