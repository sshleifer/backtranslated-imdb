The cover of this film's movie is named after Kyle Minogue, but has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in Scream. This is the first thing that makes this film blades; they're trying to sell a movie to someone who's in it for five minutes. Of course we need to have this movie for young hip colleagues who are forgotten that there is a murderer walking around. At first, Molly Ringwald, from the 80 years of theater, is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to make some money making a movie in Australia, so she will not be ridiculed in the states. In any case, this stupid film is about a terrible movie that has never been done because this simple creature kills all those who are in it. Throughout the movie, we should guess who the killer is. Short story, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or not? This move is simply bad, rent it if you feel you are torturing or just breaking it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread horror.
