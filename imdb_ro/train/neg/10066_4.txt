I have recently seen this again and there is another version that is shorter since 1999. I feel like I'm the same movie, but I'd like to know the difference. One is Japanese and no short pikachu is all can come with. Ohtherwise why do you vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Prof. Ivy was pretty boring. It sounds like she was almost asleep, with no expression with the few lines she had. It was pretty nice, but it was not too much. <br /> <br /> A collector (who after Lugia has no plans to destroy the world) and ordinary characters trying to stop him because he's trying to capture Lugia is causing a lot of destruction. /> The following Pok√©mon movies are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, with no. 8 almost here.
