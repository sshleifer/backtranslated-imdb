Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his debut with the title of himself, this time is a movie that plays for laughter. During a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her legs as you would expect, wrapped in cement. Rome as soon as possible after being hired by Waldo Gronsky. Rome is immediately in jeopardy because it has to investigate certain types of mafioso, who turn its tables and he is considered to be the main suspect, he has to go now and say he will solve the case alone. Sinatra portal is trying hard to sell our jokes and make us think it's a good detective, oh, let alone sexually appealing to the fox Raquel Welch, but he miserably fails in this project vanity fisted vanity. The frantic distribution that surrounds every woman is quite amazing, every woman in the movie is a dither head who likes to bend in front of the room, director Douglas, of course, asks her to increase her butt cracks every time she flexes the posterior muscles . There is even a camouflaged gay character who demanded faith, this being a "real men" movie for "real men" to reaffirm their own sexuality, is shamefully shameful.
