In fact, I paid to see this movie in the theater. It would get a rating of 1, but the battle scenes between the robots are fine and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have bigger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. But somehow this movie fails is that almost every piece in each set seems cheap and inexpensive. I mean, could not even make "look" good? The second major reason for this movie is horrible is the action. If I looked at the movie now and knew what to expect, I could enjoy it for the cheese factor, but at that time I was expecting a good film and not I had no idea how horrible it would actually be. Indeed, the experience ended in only 85 minutes.
