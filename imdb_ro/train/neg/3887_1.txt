I managed to look at this with MST3K, and oh boy, even with riffing this movie was terribly sorry. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be made by a monkey. The most important moments (how little they existed) came from the special effects, which were "OK". Action in most of the time was also "OK"; though nothing special, was of superior quality to the other B films I have seen in the past. The rest of this film is disappointingly bad, room work often appears as if I just put the camera man on the roller coils and pushed it. The story (if it can be called that) is so full of holes is almost funny, it never explains why the hell survived first or needs human flesh to survive. The script is badly written, and the dialogue spans a bad plan. The climax of the movie (if one exists) is absolutely ridiculous. If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid doing so at any price.
