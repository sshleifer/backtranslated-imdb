Very well MOVIE ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The song is predictable, and it's EALLY cheesy, battle creativity and dance scenes for the time are the only reason I did not give the movie is one, the other than that ... it is a movie that you can afford not to watch ..... I feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting, sort of clich√©. I realized he might have been at least a little better if he had not been so lucky, very poorly portrayed from idea to screen, I guess. The plot is somewhat predictable sometimes, the dance that I can say at TIMES is good enough, The rebound of the dancing fight was good ..... If you just make the film and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialogue that can be a 5 ... lol
