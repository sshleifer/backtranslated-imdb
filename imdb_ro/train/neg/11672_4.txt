Three writers made an attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel to the tube, yet this television movie was injected with too much melodrama and did not know when to give up. The artist who faces Meg Tilly is suddenly engaged by rich and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wishes a mural painting on the unused room walls. After learning about her last encounter - Ellen's daughter's party - Tilly decides on her artistic theme without dreaming that her daughter has died mysteriously before the job begins even when she and the deceased have had a striking resemblance with the other! Two gorgeous actresses give their services in an incredible thread that does not have a careful examination, one that does not match either to the lady with emotional intensity. Burstyn plays the camp, while Tilly gets stuck in a routine with wonderful eyes. Only one delayed sequence in the movie (morning after mural painting) is loaded with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is a bit.
