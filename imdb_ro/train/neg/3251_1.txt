I caught this movie on FX last night, and while I was sitting there watching him, I realized it might be the worst movie ever. Bad is acting, a bad cinema, bad sound, incredible fighting sequences, silly characters. All this has made her the worst movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was excited about the simple lack of any semi-competent thing that I was supposed to follow ... and they did a follow up!
