"Nineen Eighty-Four" is a movie about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very dark film and it's one that will not make you feel good about yourself. This is a story of love that takes place in this society and about the betrayal of loved ones and about human nature being selfish. The film has some very good ideas and is doing well in portraying this society with darker colors (in contrast to happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects, people and places. However, despite the film's intelligence to describe this idea, the film was very slow and does not seem to take advantage well. She seemed to spend too much time being smarter than telling a story.
