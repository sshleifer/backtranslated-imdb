I remember tracking the BSG pilot. I can describe that exact night. I remember where I stood. The show was magic. He came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I liked parts of the third year and I looked at each episode of the fourth year, with all the faith in the hope that she would come back somehow. Well, he did not. I saw pilot Caprica and I was excited. There was hope for something good here. Then I started to watch the usual episodes, and they become more and more dull. It's too obvious, too predictable. He reminds me of the political correctness of his latest unsuccessful performance, Virtuality. Much of his work on the DS9 was good. When he focused on the BSG in an organized way, he was fine. This was true earlier when the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series followed more or less. When they left this after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the pot. It was like writing the rest of the show without knowing where it was going. Maybe it will improve. Perhaps there were only a few initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
