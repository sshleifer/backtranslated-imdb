This film made in 2003 for the TV movie was featured on a women's channel, of course. Like a man, why am I even trying to look at this? I do not know, but I should look at my head. And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give people an injustice as he does. He takes every power and conviction a man can have because he has more dull women to make him in. The count was Joyce Hyser as a wife. I could not wait to give up her. Her revenge was bad and bad and very confusing for most of the movie. The other fatal woman was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you ever want to meet. Her opinion did not give him the attention that our man was driving that monkey over her and her acting was so obvious that only a madman could miss her. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good but slow in adopting the slut seducting her own husband, played again as a guy who is a loser by David DeLuise. Shooting our losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but to guard our hero. Stephen Jenkins, our hero, or I should say the victim, was not that good. At first I thought she was just a bad actor, but later I thought. He did not take part of the field and was repeated throughout. Although, as a man, I was annoyed when the two women escaped with her. Men, beware of this channel that puts people down and women escape even with murder. LMN is the channel. Take care. Note: After seeing her the second time by mistake, I am convinced of my initial thoughts. Especially the screenwriter / director, Simon Gornick. I still think he disgusted the male species and should be a horse whip. Only saving the grace in this movie is Tembi Locke, who does not have the chance to show off his talents with Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise awful act around her. Plus the stupid plot that just makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and his naked stars. Please LMN does not show this shit again.
