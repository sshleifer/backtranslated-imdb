I'm a great fan of Ludlum's work and Covert-One books, and I've often figured out how incredible they would have been in a movie. Imagine then my enthusiasm when you learn that there is such a movie! The "Hades Factor" being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start. From the beginning, the film was disappointing. The simple elements of the film, such as Griffin's first encounter with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book, and far less exhilarated. More characters are poorly distributed. For beginners, Dorff is scary like Smith. He is not a bad actor, it's just an incredibly bad choice because it's too soft and fails to expose many of John Smith's definitive features. The re-appointment, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this movie. For example, eliminating Victor Tremont and the entire story of the virus, including VAXHAM's involvement, makes the film quite unclear. Marty Zellerbach is a very big part of the book, and in the chair he's a lot different from a back seat (let alone the character of the film has nothing to do with the character in the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel should have been Randi Russel in the book. Not only should she be sister Sophie Amsden (she should be called Sophia Russel), but she should also work from the CIA, not "Covert-one". Which brings me to the last point and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this moment! Not until the second book of the series is Covert-One, designed by the president as a preventive measure against later biological terrorism. To be honest, I could go all day. In short - if you like books and want to see a good fit, I'm afraid you will be disappointed bitterly. Even as an action movie, it is well publicized, mainly due to a very glossy editing and poor effects. The whimsical story line and the sharp water scenario are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.
