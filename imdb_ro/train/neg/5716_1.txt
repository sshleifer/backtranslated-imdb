This movie does not deserve the next few minutes to spend it critically, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to assist in making decisions about movies. Just for this reason, I'm writing this. The "live feed" is an Asian version of the "incredible torture show" of 1976 (alias "Freaks sucking sucking") http://www.imdb.com/com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismantling, murder, cannibalism ... sure, it's still here, along with a third class script, pathetic action and a perverted failure of a black comedy attempt. The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There are a lot of girls in the movie who are terrified by the butchering of dogs in a market, but they are sexually pleased to enter a porno salon. A gal that is disgusted by the dirt in a late-night toilet later is still there with her boyfriend friend (as it got right there could be the only commitment to this whole movie.) The film is absolutely awful even for a movie B. Even if you downloaded it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
