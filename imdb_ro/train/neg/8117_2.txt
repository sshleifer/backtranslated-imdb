"Horrible people" should be subtitling this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people doing normal things, then look out of your window into real life. But if you want to see blatant people doing dull things, you'll have to watch this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. Characters speak widely but never communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because of Leigh's things that we all are as inefficient and pathetic as his actors and wants to film real life. But we are not, and failed.
