I really have no idea that some people find the television show of rangers, not at all interesting. The costumes are completely ridiculous, and the people who play in them also look completely crazy at the same time. There is absolutely anything interesting fun from the point of view of the powers of rank. This is just a higher-priced commercial, designed to sell highly cheesy plastic trash to children who do not wonder around the world. From the notes, I see it was forbidden in the land of New Zealand and from what I saw, I agree with their decision. Avoid this show at any cost, it's terrible and ridiculous.
