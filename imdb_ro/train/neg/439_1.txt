Just a flip-flop turned infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote," it's absolutely amazing that this improper garbage lasted for eight years. I'm sure most of those who followed this stupid stupidity were in the sixties and seventies and just granted it because they had nothing better to do or just remembered his star at the old Dick show Van Dyke. Van Dyke, who had a decent career in the 1960s, was never too much actor (admission) and was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. He looks absolutely old a result of years of smoking in chain and heavy drink. His taleless talented son, Barry, a wood actor who rarely met in something that does not involve his father, plays his son in series.
