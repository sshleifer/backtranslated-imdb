There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially just after Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So, of course, everyone had to come back to see what was what was new game play. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says so stoic and nasal, "wooww". The only thing that can be enjoyed with this show was that you knew it would end in the end. In an hour, it was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at your watch in what you think there are 10 minute intervals just to find out that it only took a minute (but it seemed an eternity) ever since you took a last look at your watch. So why did not we change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason most of the others do not ... out of optimism. I mean, nobody wants to believe that a show with Bill Shatner might be so stupid. Personally, in the first 15 minutes, I never thought that this is a kind of vehicle that would present the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. I was forgetting that I felt depressed. You still wanted to get a little enthusiasm, but there was nothing. There is not even enough light to get a sense of energy from the audience (you would not even see it). Dear Network: People do not watch game shows to cure their insomnia. clock games show that they are excited and have a good time. Please do us a favor and lose it in the safe.
