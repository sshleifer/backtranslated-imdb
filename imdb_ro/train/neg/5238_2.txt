I do not understand the positive comments about this movie. It's cheap and ugly on all levels and I do not understand how it's ever been done. Cartoon characters abound - The Irish Father is a prime example. None of the characters is at all sympathetic - except, in short, for Sue's lover asian, but even then he turns out to be capable of domestic violence! Although not as funny as both of us, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would throw at a fair like Bob - but given that they do, why should I care what happens to them ? So many reviews keep the Carpathians about being "realistic." If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to put it on the film. I did not like the movie at all.
