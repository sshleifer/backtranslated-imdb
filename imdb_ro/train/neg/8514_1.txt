I give this film ONE, because it really is a terrible movie. The soundtrack of the DVD is so bad that it hurts my ear. But the vision, no matter how disjointed, shows something really fanciful in Italian society. I will not go into detail what was actually so shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So, for a kick value, they give one. Otherwise, the film, the photo, the action of adult actors / actresses are simply substandard, a practical jock for those who love foreign movies. Roberto, the main character, has a full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being incredible. However, children in the film are often 3/4 years of age, and are authentic, and the film gives a picture of Italian life.
