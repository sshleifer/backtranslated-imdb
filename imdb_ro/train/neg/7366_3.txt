What F * @ # was that I looked at? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal now (obviously) struggles with vampire desires as "creatures with a super-human force." O.K? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even in this film, however, to quench the Seagali must have a punch-and-not-one-can-kick-my-one ego, he is in a way stronger than I am. However, all ordinary people are being destroyed around him. Come on, I can understand the bullet in the big quarter of the mouth or the drug dealer, but these are people of high human power. Oh, and to get this done, Seagal is going through a short stir of identity problems because it seems he and his cohorts in the movie think he's Wolverine! Oh GO ... And worse than all this! Yes, there is even worse. He has a voice on a voice that changes even in the middle of the thesis, while we look at his face. Obviously, they did not sound like him and I think he can be one of the other actors in the movie. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to always stop him watching a movie by the end of it. This is a drop in all time even for your movies straight to Steven's video. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two fingers down! Browse qualities? Well, I think, I will be right in this regard. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like choosing the closet for actors and actresses. All women were quite attractive. And yet, and I told him STILL, he does not compensate for X-Men, Underworld (enter your favorite zombie, the vampire movie here). The director, the screenwriter, the producer, ALL should be banned and exiled from the cinema business. I think I feel how most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost all the other pictures of Uwe Boll) about this film. That's my whole $ 1.00 worth of this movie. See if you dare.
