First of all, yes, I'm white, so I try to easily pass on to the delicate subject of the breed ... anyway ... White people Black killing = BAD But black people Escaped White people = OK (because it seems I deserved it!). where should I begin? I would like to have something good to say about this film as unintentional comedy scenes: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. enter a fight with very large, very powerful neo-natives, really angry and frightening and you win! the neo-Nazi who has twice the size :) and the pursuit! tracking is inestimable ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not offer ... this is a racist movie that reaffirms all the stereotypes of the clich√©, the white guy who lives in his hands the black roommate turns automatically in a skinhead ... cmon simply terrible I'm sorry I ever see. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the awful experience of a badly written, dumb, dull and clearly biased image, if you're in the subject, go and rent the American history X, now that's a movie
