The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in that light, she fails. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers just a little more than a brief and unique examination of the "problems" without an absolute understanding. Making a movie about stereotypes and then making every person in your movie stereotypically is a very bad strategy - especially when the same characters just break their molds in predictive, stereotyped form. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watched, and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so terrible and the social commentary is so cute, it's hard to find something redeeming .
