Hey HULU.com plays the Elvira night horror show on their site and this movie is under the name Monsteroid, a fun way to watch Elvira's commentary on this Crappy movie .... Have fun with bad movies. However, this movie really has a very low value to see how bad 70 years were for Bad Effects horror movies, Bad Dialog, the bad movie. Avoid this if you do not want to laugh. While you are at HULU check the other movies that are right now, there are 10 episodes, and some are pretty decent movies with good plot and production and you can watch many of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection .
