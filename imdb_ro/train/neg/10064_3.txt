Pokemon movie was a terrible movie. unlike the first, is not a good movie at all. the charts were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built. In the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. decreasing the number of brooches and adding traces was bad. Tracey does not have much to say or do, and unlike Brock does not offer any comical relief. the only good points are you to see that tea becomes jealous over ash, and its beginning to be called his girlfriend was fun. Generally, this movie is not worth renting, and the previous short film did nothing for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next one will be better.cant ge much worse
