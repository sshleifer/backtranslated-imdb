This is a strange movie together, you have the feeling that the bond company had to come up with it, it does not surprise me that there are no credits on it, who would want to be associated with this movie. The effect of all those involved is embarrassed and the partition jumps around, all makes little sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to come in because there seems to be a lot of images that were not shot that had to be, and all the music was a very poor music library (cheap, I guess). Very, very strange. I might buy a DVD, though it could have left me what the hell is going on and what happened to this movie.
