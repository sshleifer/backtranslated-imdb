this animated film Inspector Gadget is pretty lame.the story is very poor, and there is no pic action. just characters are given little by nothing to do. The movie is easy entertainment in the best but really does not goes anywhere where and is useless. is tracked but only fair and is not anywhere near the caliber of the animated television show of the '80s is not a movie that has a repeated view, at least in my mind. It's only about 74 minutes, including credits, so I think that's a good thing. not as in the TV show, the characters do not deserve to be rooted here. in the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but there, who cares? anyway, that's just my opinion. Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10
