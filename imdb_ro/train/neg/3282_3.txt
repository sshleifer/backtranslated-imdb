Duke of Hazzard will receive academic prizes! Best Actress and Actress 4 People who can tell with a straight face that this was a great movie. This "movie" was a torture to watch. So sad as a half hour amusement has been ruined by these amateurs. The only good thing about this shit was the car! I remember when Daisy was a real threat to show the 4th 2 years. Who's the fool who decided that Jessica Simpson is hot? We know he can only act. TV Daisy was a fox and a brunette. All members who have contributed to these time losses please do not even think of a sequel, prequel or anything else an earlier TV show. I gave a blank DVD, so this "movie" could be burned 4 me. I sit by it and I want the money back!
