I'm gonna give it here, it was the toughest sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I greet as one of his greatest movies of all time. Now, remove the awesome tracks, add a weak plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. "Put it together and what are you doing?" the biggest load of cruelty I've ever seen. After seeing this, I thought it was all for Disney. Cinderella should have ended with "and lived happily afterwards." not this garbage. This movie does not deserve a sequel like this one. I thought it would be like a "return in time" that was moderate, but better than that. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? He changed the parts like Iago, but he did not help anyone.
