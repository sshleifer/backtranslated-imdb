It's easy to see how this under-scenario has reached the start of sales at Regency Films (and later with Fox): cross the genre of the superhero with a comedy about "Fatal Attraction" ... voil√†! I do not know how a talented director like Ivan Reitman was involved, unless the salary was too tempting. An uneducated employee at an architectural design firm in New York. meets a girl in the subway and asks her; Despite being distracted and unpleasant, she finally takes her to bed - only to find out later that she is the super-hero resident of Big Apple, G-Girl. This superman, with powers attributed to a fallen meteorite, is not a heroic fantasy, yet ... screenwriter Don Payne conceived it as a needy, possessive, revengeful bitch (he telegrams us this distance from miles away, although Uma Thurman still plays the role of laughing sassy). This is a kind of worthless film that can not let an insult slip. Our introduction to the leading man, Luke Wilson, who talks to Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by an acute homosexual disaster (we are said to be very men). After being approached by G-Girl's discontent, who wants to master her powers, Wilson is told that this will only be done by an ordinary woman despised ... and not so much better? Thurn's early encounters in films such as "Henry & June" and "Jennifer 8" featured an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poetry; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped them expose her hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress apparently lost her grace). The image is extremely well produced and shot, with costly special effects, but no one has bothered to find humor in this scenario. He's pushed, ugly, ugly and stupid. Humiliated, frozen, Wilson can not tell any of his colleagues that he meets G-Girl because he swore he'd rather have a stiff chain in the rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought he was hilarious ... or, indeed, if someone was involved? * from ****
