I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was a Christian. The director had a good idea / intentions when he made this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for who he thinks is the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, indifferent and rude. The principal person apologized to his friends when they told him. They did not understand at all and used God as a reason to explain their behaviors. The main person and no one else knew if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married, etc., but they were against him by solving old feelings that had to be treated. His friends ought to have been Christians and should have been represented as supporters if they agreed with his decision or not. Whenever we do things in life that we do not apologize to those we hurt in the past and when they tried to do that, they were against it. The ironic part was his new female friend, who accused him of having a tracking behavior because he was looking for an old friend when he did a strange thing to get his name, address, and phone number. .. seemed to be a stalker! she did not seem to be a friend at all, but she was only looking for herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they should have been with them, and I feel the movie made a horrible injustice making him look like God does not care about true love. .. just stay with someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... it's just the steps you take to make amends. As I said the film has potential, but I was tired of unilateral point of view being constantly repeated and blocked the throat of viewers of so-called ... well-understood friends. This film did not respect the Christian belief of love, but gave her a C for his effort.
