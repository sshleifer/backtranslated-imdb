SCARECROWS seems to be a horror encounter with the supernatural movie. A group of criminals pulls out a paramilitary payroll plunder at Camp Pendleton in California. They picked up a cargo plane by kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with the need to fly to Mexico. Over time, a greedy robber decides to save the money landed in a corn field monitored by strange scarecrows. These are not just scarecrows that can be killed. The act is no better than horrible dialogue. And humorous attempts are not funny. Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark. The film includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, BJ Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
