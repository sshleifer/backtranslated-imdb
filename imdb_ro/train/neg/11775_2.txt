Looking at "Kroko" I would love to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development, Kroko, the child's metaphorical German problem, remains a pure metaphor without the ability to engage positively, despite more chances to do so. Uninspired actors, non-evolutionary plot. I think the movie tried an environmental study, but it did not succeed: the room appeared strangely rather than motivated. Photos were low, gray and dark in contrast - I'm sure that deliberately, but the components did not bring a convincing impression of the social environment. However, the story had some potential, it could have made a short story.
