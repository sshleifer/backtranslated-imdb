Hearing how hilarious this movie is, I finally leased it to the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times. This movie, a collection of skits that make television fun is an incoherent mess. Banknotes collapse, humor deals with 1970s issues that are no longer relevant, and jokes are going too long (almost the same as the new SNL has outlined over the last few years). Yes, Chevy Chase is in this, but maybe all, about 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was really bad and had a lot of nudity but could not be funny? You are a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Film, which is a superior film, made in
