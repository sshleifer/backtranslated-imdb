Do not drink refreshing aid. This is a piece of opinion disguised as a documentary. And to designate it as "truth" is just stupid. The debate over global warming is far from over and will only end when eco-zombies will begin to recognize the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a river of information that reject almost every link in a logic chain that Gore sites. The reason why it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures will have. Wake up the people. Anyone with a computer, a bit of time and a good sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible. Do not just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis in fact. There are simply too many alternative and contradictory possibilities for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so uncertain, in fact, that it may be the greatest freak in the course of human existence. It is time for people to start talking against this type of propaganda and it is time for people to recognize for themselves and for others that you can be both a conservative and acknowledge the obvious conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie.
