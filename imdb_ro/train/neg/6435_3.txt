I find it hard to believe that someone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. If the Exorcist was subtle and creepy, the Stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and too much formic. This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I have seen in a while, but the images do not make for the downward spiral of patronage exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie was touched when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website has increased interest. The website has had many stories of "real" stigma in history. Still, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed with searching for "authenticity," that it becomes first comic, then very hard to follow to the end. I began to be suspicious when the priest in charge of investigating potential miracles enters the beauty parlor if our heroine could cut her hair and obviously flirt with the priests. Figure: A woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (Stigmata) and is embarrassed and annoyed by the herd. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan or a vessel for Jesus Christ? The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
