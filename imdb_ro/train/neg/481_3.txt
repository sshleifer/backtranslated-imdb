Whenever a movie is so miopic in its desire to present a certain end or point of view, which simply does not bother with a real story, it is annoying. These are the types of movies in which the end point or viewpoint is first conceived, and the story is simply approached. For this reason, we often talk about the story "jumping through the circles" as it twists, trying in vain to progress to the preordonated end in a logical manner. The Story of Comedy on Broadway does not just go through circles, it's a circle with three rings. It's so absurd, so poorly conceived, so discreet that if you're prone to speak out loud on the screen, you'll be pretty young before it's over. The central theme of this screen saver is that of a woman who chooses between family and profession. Since everything is so terribly horrified, it will be offensive to opinion people. So, ultimately, it makes no sense to relate to this story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with bad scenarios, the act does not save anything.
