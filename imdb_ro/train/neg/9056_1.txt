I've seen some live movies, but that must be one of the worst. Soon we will watch two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car on a Reno road. Apparently, Lonnie is not too happy with his sexual life, so he deceives his wife with Candy, who desperately tries to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, is not too sure if his sperm is okay, so he checks her by a doctor. Now we read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not, and she broke out after about 20 minutes: "Oh yes, she will be pregnant, but her husband can not have children." Spot on, as this movie is soooo predictable. Like boring. And annoying. No Sens. Offensive. Terrible. An example of how great this movie is. The two couples started in their big car to Nevada when they were stopped by two police officers because they did not stop at a stop sign. The guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a beer case. Not only is this scene unnecessary and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just about talking, talking and talking, never going anywhere. Still, I have to think somehow at the end. Roy does not seem to have problems there, so he's the baby's father. How many times this happens in movies ... try something new! Finally, the deceived wife forgives her husband and best friend because he has this business, and all of them live happily afterwards. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie is at the end, with some photos of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just keep the camera on it for 90 minutes? One would expect more from this distribution (though Thornton is really trying), but you can not blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
