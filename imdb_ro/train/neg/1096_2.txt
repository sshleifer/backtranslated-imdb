While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them were military instructors as ex-Nazis. Obviously, those who wrote the script were either anti-military or have written a movie for that audience. I am veteran Viet Nam, and even during this period, military instructors who have behaved in some of them would probably still spend time in the military prison. And I really enjoyed the scene where the "hero" and his buddy (both private) sit in the captain's office smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the captain as if he were their friend. This type of work has never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. Finally, I wondered: "What was this movie about?" because it seemed to wander around the place without focus, except "I hate all authority". Thank God I got it from the library and I did not pay to rent it.
