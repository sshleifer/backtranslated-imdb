What the "executive producer" does in a movie. If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised the financial support to make the film. You can see in a large number of movies with Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer who meant that Connery raised his money because he is an important player. Unfortunately, it should be stressed that a large number of films "with Sean Connery were made only because he managed to raise money because he is a major player at Hollywood, is usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the film are one and the same film itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with a story / scenario is not up to scratches PROTOCOL follows the next saga of a Sunny Davis a bootlegger saves a dignitary visit and as a reward becomes a top diplomat Probably as things progress, Ms. Davis (who has trouble getting together two sentences) finds itself in more unusual and unlikely situations. When I say that the PROTOCOL is Goldie Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the movie, do you understand what they say about the story / scenario that does not rise to zero?
