I liked the show! I think there was nothing wrong with that! Just that Spidey does not make anyone, but just because the show does not suck! Some people think this show is bad about that. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared as X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Sandman never appears, but I really like it! The Best Show Spidey Ever! My favorite episodes are: 1. Return point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobboblin 4. Alien Costume 5. The Moving Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are a few episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot, which was embarrassing I will look. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First, Morbius sucks plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it irritates me that he was almost the worst offender in Season 2. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! It was terrible! Rather, I see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as Spider Man! But I think everything was bad!
