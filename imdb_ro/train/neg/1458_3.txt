The back cover of the DVD (which missed her when she left) leaves Hitler - Rise Of Evil as "New York Post" and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). , I do not mind the post, but really, who ever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace, art has to be thrown away. I have no where to start. Why try painting the image of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was badly alright, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often inaccurate from the historical point of view (compared to his love for animals, the gentleness and the way he treated women) and so far away. well, so you have to feel bad about them because they are locked inside the one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: It's the second time in his honorable career when he finished playing an old and failed leader in a failed film (or in this case, TV production, be right). The first of these was, of course, the legendary Galigula. Only inaccurate scenes in history would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I will leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is OK if it's on the TV and you have nothing else to do but believe me - it's better left at Virgin's local store.
