Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DO NOT LOOK NOW was he not? Strangely, the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC television on the weekend that made COLD HEAVEN's evening screening not favoring what has ever been. <br /> <br /> You see that it's impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DO NOT LOOK NOW, because both have the same director and same structure, and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN we thought they had the same plot, the exception of the fact that a dead husband was replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was put on this film that was spinning around a widow suffering from pain, seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red anorak . This does not happen, but about one-third of the way through the running time has a massive turn of plot and despite the fact that it's essentially twisting behavior is not explained in any great depth. In fact, very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN that ruins the film People mentioned the fairly low production values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I had not been different, I would have thought it was a TVM, since it made it for television to feel right up to white letters in the title sequence. Roeg is also trying to inject art claims through the thought processes, but again this does not help the movie at all. You can not help to feel Roeg should have put all his efforts in the breath of the plot that is completely flat on the screen The cheap production values, the disinterested direction and a really bizarre premise and the script make for a bad movie
