In an equally good review, loleralacartelort7890 says, "The truth is that Americans are using a secret anti-radiation alloy alloy, which is not well known and the exact specifications are a secret, why should it reveal it then? would be in a space flight with the Russians, then it would be very bad to disclose that they have a new technology that could protect the crew against radiation. " This is completely incorrect. There is (and was not) any "secret" radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo command module has long been available to the public. Use a lightweight aluminum honeycomb and stainless steel honeycomb. The entire outer surface (except for the windows, of course) is covered with a thermal shield made from a thicker phenolic resin on the bottom facing during reintroduction. These materials are actually better at stopping the radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is best suited for stopping ionized photons, such as X-rays and gamma rays. is a problem defined for * long-term * space flight because of the risk of large solar rays. But it was simply not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The command module gave them pretty good protection during the short pass (about half an hour) through Van Allen's belts. We all have dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation each received: no more than 1.5 rem and usually much less. Of the 24 people who flew to the Moon (12 of them landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died because of heart attacks, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are, in fact, good statistics for a group of men who were in the late 1970s (Shepard was 86).
