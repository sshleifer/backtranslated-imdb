Any film titled "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed for death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be a US institution, but it is virtually unknown in Europe to the broader audience. "The European Lamp at European level" is unlikely to remedy this situation. Terrible Griswaldi are just that - horrible. They're not funny. Clearly, Mr. Chevy Chase thinks it's funny after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot about his jokes, but he pays for her and does not have to pay £ 2.50 for that privilege. The section established in England is typical. The same old old television interpreters, Miss Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman descend to the same old old tired clichés, Mr. Chase is lost in the corridor of the hotel ... yawn, yawn, yawning .. Bucking - Big Palace ...... I feel cheated that I have never seen bobbies on a bicycle two or two years ......... red red cheeks on boar - Dren, must I go on? The English are buffons, the vicious French - tongued Yank - haters. The Germans are pompous and swollen, (they do not remember the war, Clark), and the Italians lecherousi the pinch down. I forgot something? Any possible "comic" situation is resolved to death, Mr. Chase laughs desperately, Miss Angelo gossips sweetly, the children are embarrassing to the bad. The fact that this franchise has fled as long as it has done has to bring comfort to those who propose that you never lose money underestimate the public taste.
