I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson who thought they were friendly policemen. They are, but Busey is in the opening scene, then does not show up again as much as 40 minutes in the movie. Although each scene is wonderful. Especially when he's hiding like a blind hobo. What's incredible about this movie is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who's following and killing sex phone operators. At some point I think this is Busey. But it looks like I'm only partially correct. Busey is not the killer, but he calls and harasses women on the phone. Why? I do not know. Under no circumstances is he connected to the killer, he just does it for blows I think.
