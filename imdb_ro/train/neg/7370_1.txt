I have seen a lot of Seagal movies and, while most are not big or good, this steamed bunch has lowered the bar for bad movies. The land is not safe. Something about a medicine that makes you crazy and strong or something like that. Who are the good boys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is filmed in scenes that happen between people in bright rooms, complaining about how good the Seagals' Mashall character is. <br /> <br /> Act: Drown. "What was the terrible voice? Could he find someone who sounds less like Seagal? May, as if Cheech or Chong made the voices, maybe at least be fun then. This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid it at any price !!!!
