Haunting is still a remarkable remake of horror, with special effects of false overdose and a large cast of favorite screen, and has no redeeming qualities, except perhaps for cinema. Remakes are not all bad, but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont are for sure. I suppose the actors in A-List (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract our attention from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to scare his audience, yet this film is not a tabloid magazine it does not matter who cares about the characters and the story of the two things this movie has missed. The story is like getting the classic novel The Haunting of Hill House and getting out of four chapters and then using everything that's left for the movie is so boring and a lot of it is inexplicable. The characters are pretty thin and while the actor is good, you do not care about any of the characters. Lily Taylor gives a terrible performance and she sounds like she's eight years old when she gives you the lines, not to mention what a scandal is horrible. Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, looks like a bunch of Casper Ghost's, and Hugh Cain's ghost resembles a fat type dressed like a grueling Halloween reaper with a smoke machine. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms, which is a giant purple mouth and is not even funny, unintentional, pretty good and well thought out, which is probably the only positive thing about this movie looks beautiful, but that does not save it from to him is brutal anything else. I can honestly say I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would have been worse if I paid to see it but fortunately it was on Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a weak attempt at horror.
