How can a scotch in a kilt make love in purple purple beer? Very, very careful. Now I have the distinct advantage of many other commentators in my being born in Scotland. But too many Americans seriously take this simplistic nonsense. It's a joke, people, "four good feet - two bad feet," just as Orwell had. Jessica Lange emphasizes that Brigadoon production of Wells - next - sea Amateur Dramatic will drop. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with ladies - carries his kilt with the full authority of a man whose Grandfather once gave up the Edinburgh Waverley train. And the enemy Auld? Where would they be without them hate and blame for everything? The rulers, Roth, Cox, and Hurt should be ashamed of allowing such racist stereotyping. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems to be a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
