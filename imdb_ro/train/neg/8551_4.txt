It's 1982, two years after the Siege of the Iranian Embassy, ​​which involved SAS's dramatic rescue from the Balcony, and with a war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, which is now taking place, which film is better than a Gung-Ho "SAS" - creates the siege of Iranian hostages, while using Britains the number one hero of action of the day, Lewis Collins. throw yourself into Edward Woodward and some other well-known actors and have a winner on your hands? ... Well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the acting is quite second. is like a long-lasting episode of "Professionals," but without a formula. This movie does not go anywhere fast and is quite predictable. Perhaps Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to get Lewis Collins to replace Touted James Bond for Roger Moore. Take care if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS in general, if not, save your time.
