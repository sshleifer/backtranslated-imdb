I am surprised by the many female voters who even give this film more signs. My thought in this film was that the target audience was adult and masculine. Women mocked and tortured, merciless vengeance and a large number of bodies are typical ingredients introduced into the history of the spaghetti subgroup film. The opening and breaking of the hands are DJANGO robberies. SHOOTER, however, does not have the style of ex. Django. Score, acting and cinema are mediocre at best, but if you're looking for the ingredients above, you're here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
