I could not look more than 14 minutes. It's a great combination of very bad action and very bad direction. The used photos are disgusting, they have broken the 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts to look at that "you know what" load. The misery of the "mystery car" window makes you see the light from the window light ... annoying. What else ... is so badly framed all the time makes you want to yell at the lady who leads there. I've only directed short films, but I'm pretty sure I'd be a lot better off than going to a long movie ... the story is incredible, just the long French kissing scene from the beginning tells you it'll be terrible. So, pretty much, try to really avoid all the really bad movies, save you $ 5 for rent, and at 1h30 of your life you will not come back ...
