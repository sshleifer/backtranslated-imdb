The saddest story about this "tribute" is that almost all the singers (including anyone else incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point of Cohen's intensity: passing his lines in an almost unclear poem, of his poetry, his irony, his full humanity, laughter and tears in one. In order to see that some of these singing singers make sad confusing faces, she launches her offensive stones in the patent effort to yell "I'm a singer!" It's a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably listened to in some horrible lyrics of simple songs, such as "Imagine" by Lennon. Nothing simply comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is a form of art that does not need ornaments, it's Cohen's art. Dividing threw it on the street as a sex-free makeup for sale. In this tribute to Cohen, I found myself suffering and suffering through delusive tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all of which completely deprive the original irony of the master, and if the truth is told, some singers sounded as if they had been recruited to a show of asylum talents. Cohen pays tribute to them, letting them sing the material, indeed, not the other way round: maybe they were friends or his daughter, he could have become very seductive and in the mood of a gift. Too bad he did not stay in the family. Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen himself interpreted the greatest "Song tower," but even that flower was spoiled by the totally incongruous backdrop of U2, all bearing the expression bored children have when they visit their grandfather poor in the nursing home. A sad, sad and sad show if you truly love Cohen as I do.
