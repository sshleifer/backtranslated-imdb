I did not see the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s, as if these two terrible consequences were not even justified. This movie had a great star when they advertised to run on one of the old independent stations that are a thing of the past. Anyway it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney films look dark. Indeed, this film was just a bunch of light-eyed, with almost no creature rich in defenders to be seen. The only real vision is nearing the end when you see its shape during a very abundant storm, other than the fact that there is practically no sign of the creature that was truly disappointing as a child. The story is, in essence, the old bad hunters have to kill everything they see and are after the rich creature of the stream, and the children are out to help her, or just some sort of hairy guy in the woods who likes to shoot random water boats. It's not worth watching, but I would like to see the original, which was given to the producer who would have made the rich creature from the 1980s, but also made a very good movie in "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
