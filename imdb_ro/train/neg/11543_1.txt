Although I use this site quite frequently to see how others have rated what they think are provocative or just pure movies, after watching this movie "Film Four" last night, I felt compelled to write something, even if it helps me clean up once more. The movie was probably the least experience I had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) And Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) had no real substance about them - I'm not sure if the first half-hour of the movie did not make the final cut, but certainly in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims ... here I could not care. In fact, the only character I seemed to care about was the dog, with the deer approaching the second time. And both animals came out of Dire (sic) and Scully, who were quite honest. I assume that although you are as good as the script you give, I would like to warmly thank the writers, the producers, the director and all those who have told him that they have lost 90 minutes of my life and perfectly good electricity.
