You know you have problems when the narrative opening tells you essentially who survives. Everything comes down from there. Useless, working on the bullet-time room influenced by the "Matrix". Unnecessary reductions in video game recording. Old Marine Captains and Mariners. Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye. Even the zombies are boring. We hoped at least one zombie movie "so bad is good," but it is "so bad that those involved in creating it should be excluded from ever making a movie again." <br /> <br />
