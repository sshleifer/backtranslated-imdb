Someone called Howard Koch a schockmeister, but he wrote the script for "Casablanca," is not it? Or did not. Perhaps there is more than one Koch around in Hollywood, and I do not really love "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there is another Howard Koch that moves around Hollwyood. That's what Casablanca wrote. Does not matter. I will pay much attention to this commentary as "Howard W. Koch" put into this production, that is, just a little. Do you know what that sounds like? Someone read Cliff's notes about Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided that there were no original thoughts on board Inbound Inspiration Express, updating it and hollywooding it with a happy ending. There are differences. Lear decides to divide the extended properties between three sisters and before he does them, asks how much I love him. Two of his sisters are thrown at his feet and snapping his nose to take his money. The third is a good girl and she refuses to go to Lear. But in the play, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two conveyors his master and look at the honest girl. He goes crazy and gets naked during a holes in the mills, making flowers in his hair and hallucinating. Kids can do this to you. (Take your child, for example, after all the effort that I scrambled to raise him, show any interest in becoming a doctor or lawyer?) No) Finally, everyone in the play dies. /> In the movie, obviously the good sister is morocco and suicide, but when she tries to stop, a person jumps and saves her, so the end is more or less happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy if you do not define Hollywood as a self-sufficient tragedy.
