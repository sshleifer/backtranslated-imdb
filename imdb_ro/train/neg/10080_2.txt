I had to do a search for actresses to find the picture of this movie because the title is now an unexpected love. It's not worth looking for, but I was not familiar with both of you and I wondered why they were at the forefront of a lesbian film about Lifetime. Everything is pretty memorable and you do not really have an idea about who these characters are, as a spectator, I was not able to be emotionally invested in the story. I think I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is focused, silent and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a prudent interest in seeing two women, but it was treated so discreetly that I was disappointed. Instead, rent your Personal Best.
