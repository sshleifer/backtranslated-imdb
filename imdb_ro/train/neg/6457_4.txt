I think I've seen movies worse, but that may just be as bad as the standard of these horror films is. The monster criminal thing is really really bad, basically a guy in a green body suit. There's a lot worse about movie B, but I do not think that for a second it was a star, no, no. In fact, he had a plot of substance, but he was still pretty bad. Basically, it's just a low-budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as the titanic, the movie is beaten by balls, that's really stupid. Blood looks very fake in this movie. This is a complaint I have about all the horror of the new milan, low grade gore, looks stupid. A good scene of terrible death, with fake blood, is so bad. At least it was a nice shower scene
