I watched this movie in the hope that we will see some movements of Jet Li, where we were amazed by Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his battle stunts are so clear that they even took that joy from she. Flight hits would be more impressive if you could not see the yarns to keep it flying in the air for 4 seconds and 9 strokes. Too complete and very disappointing.
