I'm sorry, but maybe it was scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just does not get up. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the initial scene in which Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most surprising moment in the whole movie is when his parents give their mask to see that their son killed their daughter. The movie is down and does not rise until the last fifteen minutes, but until then it's too late, the audience has lost all interest in the story. Almost no character development, and people always talk about the fact that Laurie is such an exceptional heroine when it really is not too much for her. I'm sorry I do not agree with everyone frightened by this movie, but if you want a great movie, go see Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not among them. I can not believe that Roger Ebert gave him four stars, for this film can never deserve such a high rating.
