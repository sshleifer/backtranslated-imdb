I like to watch western movies, but this movie takes the biscuit. The script and the dialogue are ridiculous. The act was terrible, where did they get it? Music was ok I have to say. Fortunately, we did not buy or rent the movie, but now we've removed it. I was prepared at the beginning when the stranger (martin lucian) started telling her the story. I have to admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot him on Tex's finger and told him to practice 40 years to reach his league. But there it all began to flow in the form of pears. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would improve, never did.
