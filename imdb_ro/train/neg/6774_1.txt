As a fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and shudder, as AMC interpreted it as a comedy. I've never been more disappointed with a movie! Cary's usual song and effortless comedy are AWOL from the entire movie; he meets as tense, bored and not himself. The character of Mississip is one of the most serious stereotypes I have ever seen - its emphasis is extremely exaggerated (and incorrectly, according to which some of the Mississippi he claims to have failed) and whenever he gives it line, is more decibels larger than any other casting member. Mississip tried to emphasize in the film as a joyous gofball, but ultimately he only succeeds in getting down from the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene doll than a Hollywood cat and, while she was never known at Hollywood for her ability to act, this film tells her she never had this ability. The character of Ray Walston was suggestive and, ultimately, invented. For the four men who went to shore, it was the biggest exit I've ever seen. I looked at this nightmare until its end and, while I will not spoil this for anybody, I tell you it is the most absurd you will ever see. The film tries to increase patriotism and a sense of indebtedness to combat people, but the film loses this point entirely due to its weak plot of plot and weak distribution. I'm sorry, Cary!
