I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go on, but than she did so bad. First of all, the distribution is wrong, where did that van peeble (actor's gross actor) and his father appear? Looks like Carlito came out of the hood, and he used to stand with some real idiots. This film does not make "Carlitos Way" any justice. I am so happy that the sequel "Carlito's Way" first came out, if I had seen this garbage first, I would never have given a chance to the pacino version. And anyway, pacino should have read this story, thought it was stupid and continued. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
