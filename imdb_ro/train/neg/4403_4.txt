Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the film shows local Iranians speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. This is enough to lose credibility to anyone with the least knowledge of the area or country. The landscape could not be more different than the real one. Other factual errors: It seems that a train is operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador bears a Fez (red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey long before the film was set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and classical Indian music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the directors wanted to look like an exotic woman, and the jump was what they decided to do to exotic.
