Although I enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies, it seems to me that this movie is especially a barbecue. Maybe because I'm from a different era and from a different country, but I discovered Crosby's chronic encounters to the Old United States, good at first, after a while, after a while, and then finally annoying. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American - but it seemed to the English that they can not make any right and / or need this brave, so intelligent American visitor to show them the way. It's a "fish in the water" story, but unlike most of this kind of movie, this time it's the "fish" that has the upper hand. To be fair to me and to the film, I've looked at it several times over the course of a few years and I have the same impression every time. (I saw another Crosby movie last night - The Waltz of the Emperor - and that made the same reaction, and to my surprise, even my wife - who for what she deserves is American - found that the attitude "in front of you" Crosby is irritating, Roosevelt, as she said.) As to the premise of the film, it is unique enough for her day, and the support distribution is, of course, very good. The landscape and the music are also good, just like the big costumes - although I agree with a previous commentator that the William Bendix wig seems horrible (Moe picture of the Three Stoogi). for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without Bing Crosby's attitude, but because he's in almost every shot it's hard to get through this movie.
