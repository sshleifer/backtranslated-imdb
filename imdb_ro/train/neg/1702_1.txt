Let's be honest here: the only reason anyone bought this, the only reason someone has analyzed this, and the only reason anyone can claim to enjoy this is that David Lynch did it because you want to have the children of David Lynch. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of nonsense. Perhaps Lynch wanted to overcome normality and experience the absurd in itself as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the atrocious, cacophonic, and visual scratches of chickens should involve something about the place of mankind in the world, about our relationship with the Real, the absurdity of all. Instead, he simply said one thing: I lost 20 bucks. If I wanted offensive for the offensive sake, I could take Hansen to the top and leave my ears for blood. If I wanted to be absurd for the sake of absurdity, I could take a hole on a plate and watch it for 33 minutes. There is only one redemption quality in Dumbland - it is meta, funny meta. That is, it's so bad that it's not even funny because it's so bad. This, however, is a bit funny. If you hate and hate your money, then you buy Dumbland. If not, book your agony.
