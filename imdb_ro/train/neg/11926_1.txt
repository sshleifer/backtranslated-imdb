I'm rarely moved to make this kind of comment, but after I stood by the most terrible movie, I feel like I really got the right to say what I feel about it! I did not manage to make it to the end and became one of six half or more (after a third of the audience) after the tattered plot, terrible dialogue and insulting characterization have become too much to wear. this film is still pose and not art. all style and no substance. is weighed by a terrible act, a truly terrible scenario, an indifferent cinema, and student-level production values. how it was funded, started and finished, is a mystery to me. I bet one million money never goes to the general release. the right critics would break him apart. a very bad movie. Shockingly bad. a really really poor effort and that is without mentioning even the free time of the newborn-kitten-becomes-deep-barber-thrower. utterly meaningless, totally mild, ill-prepared; this film is a terrible embarrassment for UK cinema.
