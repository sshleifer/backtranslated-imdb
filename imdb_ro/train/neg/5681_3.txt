After seeing and loving Post, I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and selected Seed because I happened to hinder myself in a local DVD store and should be one of the best movies. While the first 10-15 minutes of the movie were very promising and seemed to be the beginning of a psychological thriller, not too much, it soon descended from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic movies slasher I have seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses, and sub-parasitic actions. It seems that Boll tried everything he could to come up with a decent plot, but after a while he just gave up on it. Maybe it should stay comedy ?! Some good things about this movie are that they manage to create a creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected, and that the soundtrack goes well with the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced impulse of this film, combined with its generic character, the last half hour is pretty tiring, which has destroyed my experience. There is a very good shocking scene, but it seems there is only the shock value. And let's not forget the work from the room that was quite heavy at times. I hope Uwe Boll will one day find out what makes a good movie, because among many horrible movies seems to make a decent movie from time to time. Seed is not one of these.
