Do Every Good Story Have To Be "Enhanced" With Broadway Corby Music? It seems that those who can not come up with their own lands believe classical literature is just there for robbery. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites because it is certainly true that Dickens has often written things that have left you considerably, and that was a great example of this ... So of course, and add the wrong music and do it with every character, from promoting orphaned boys to shredding shakes and is suddenly uplifting? Brrr. Bring me a basin. The four stars in my rating come from casting, which I was able to resemble that of my God. Each of these films had a distribution that a version of the game might be proud, but then have to go and sing them (see the above complaint). Unlike My Fair Lady, singers here could do this and have spared our song by Oliver Reed (forgive me if I'm wrong, it's been a while), she said. Why do all of them, except the shameless, by putting stupid songs into a perfect story? Rarely this has been done effectively. In general, it ruins the story. He did it with that. The jury remains concerned about whether this story deserves to be saved, but with everything that seems to be impossible to say.
