This is the story of two guys who have found a copy of "Funky Monkey". Finding this seemed odd at the time that there are supposedly still posters for the local Cineplex Odeon movie. After seeing such classics as "in any direction but free" and "project X," these two guy movies with monkeys are wonderful. These guys were on a long walk as they watched this movie. It was a monkey that was replaced by a MAN stunt when action sequences were needed. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained in Shakespearean acting school. Perhaps monkey replacement with Ben Affleck could have helped the boys think. Perhaps a strong guard would help Jackie Chan or maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this film had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look-a-like-Matthew Modine. While some may claim that Matthew Modine is not approaching Jet Li, room tricks prove to be just as good. When it becomes apparent that an untreated chimpanzee can not handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine to be the real star. Did I mention that there is a Dorky kid who develops a link with Modine and the monkey? Is it possible that the child learns confidence and even takes a girl into this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this (because using the "I am the second rape to a monkey" pickup line does not seem to work with ladies.) Shortly after I saw this movie, the two guys received a phone call from Matthew Modine by saying "Seven Days".
