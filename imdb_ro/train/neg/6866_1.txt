This movie has such a small class compared to Strangers in a train or even an accidental encounter, because despite the shared similarities, I would not feel comfortable comparing it with any of them. The character of Yancy Butler appeared in such a diminution that I was too embarrassed for the writer and the director to keep looking. I do not like many movies for life, but I feel compelled to look every moment in the interest of promoting harmony at home. Often times I'm groaning in silence, but this movie provoked me to protest out loud, standing up to leave the room and go around the house mumbling before I returned to my favorite seat to obey me more tortures. > Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
