Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and some modern psychology, then seeing live performances is the only thing worth watching. This film has tons of tones and tones, together with President Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-major role and many deadly scenes of death. Looks like it's okay, is not it? Well, the dead continue to come repeatedly to many different Warp Tour bands and fans at the event. Some of the deaths start elegant, but then they are recycled over and over to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies that he has destroyed his head or that the intestines are drawn from the stomach. Gore looks like it was from "Zombie 90: Pestilence Extreme" by Andreas Schnaas; with this type of "hurt" blood, but now this movie is actually decent and offers humor - something that terribly lacks this movie. Sure, the film is made by Doug Sakmann of Troma, has a low budget potential and tries ... but too hard. Everything is too intense to be fun in this movie, and that's what brings it down. Everything is trying to be too comic and bad, by using intentional intentional action, excessive use of unnecessary deaths and doing the same thing ... again and again. It's basically "Much: Zombie Ass-Kicker," "President of the Board," or any movie you've done with your friends: it's fun for those who did it and that's it. potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same ... over and over: A play plays, a band dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. The question is for these types of movies - which is essentially "bad-stick-stick" - do not try too much or not at all?
