There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, a partner rated this movie as a D grade. I say it was too beautiful. A piece of wood could be more excited that the actors in this film and the money used to produce this film would have been better used to trigger a fire. This is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life, so that anyone with this unusual blood bath will never come back. After I looked at 5 minutes, I and the boys wondered if heavy dives would do that much more fun. Half a card and a bottle of 151 later, I finally found that some of this class G acts remotely fun. It's an insult on the whole planet that the director thought anyone could find something more advantageous than that, should go and buy a rope. And the actors in this movement, I hope you have been paid well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again. In conclusion, everyone in this movie has 100,000 and 12 points out of your acting license.
