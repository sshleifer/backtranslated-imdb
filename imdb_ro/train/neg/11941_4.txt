While cracking the strange good joke, humor is generally quite dry, with panel members frequently pulling faces or recourse to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud enough jokes jokes. Unlike what another comment says I do not think this is the best TTE ever made, really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the smallest form of intelligence, there are few really fun funny gags that make you really laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the well-known comedy name, rather than judging the quality of gags that are not that good. Generally, his mediocre, with some good laughter, but often can be quite mediocre. It's not as good as the stuff of Jasper Morcov or Dave Allens. I find Benny Hill more fun.
