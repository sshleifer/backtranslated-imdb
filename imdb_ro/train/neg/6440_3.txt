This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've ever seen. It simply did not come out at all. With the wise card, I thought it would be pretty good, but each match seemed to be short. Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the best matches. Benoit wore it. I do not think MVP was great, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe Khali and every other person in life does not mix. A great game. <br /> <br /> Ashley I'm not a fan of female fights. Origin of ECW vs. New race I was delighted with this match until I saw it. Seriously, really disappointing. Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy Matt Hardy vs. Kennedy vs. Kennedy Finlay vs Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match so far. Only a major man left down to many people in the ring at the same time. It simply did not live. Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. Batista vs. Undertaker It was maybe the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel like this game deserves to be the last one. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm getting sick to see winning each match. It's a little old. Now, I have to say, I feel like this game is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a little focused. Batista vs. "Taker could have been better, but I'm biased, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and most of the other things turned out to be very short.
