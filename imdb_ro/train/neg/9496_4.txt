Dramatic romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship that grows between a good hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in the golden years (William Holden, surprisingly affectionate in this extremely concise arrangement). The scenario is easy, but not with some thoughtful passages; however, the script is such a middle-aged clich√© so far that most of the picture is lost as a child. You may have worked much better with other stars: Holden and Lenz do not fit well (its stature is so light that it seems to overturn it), making their scenes intimate less agitated than simply uncomfortable. Date, unclear-romantic and, above all, unmotivated. ** from ****
