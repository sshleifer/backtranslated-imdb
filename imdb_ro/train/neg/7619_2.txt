As a fan of the Mystery 3000 Science Theater, I can withstand any film that can push me, but there is no reason for that. "Restricted Watch Timer," I suppose these are the only methods that Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from a person who can not be upset. <br /> <br /> Shame on you Robert Napton! Be embarrassed by the exploitation of these poor Mexican actors, whom you have probably promised to be hoping to be great in American cinema. You're a shame! <br /> <br /> There is no time in this movie to keep the slightest bit of action. Have you used bites on these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in a field! Like all 6. And is not an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always during the day? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show something ... and more importantly why did I watch the other 1/2? PS: You owe me 4.50.
