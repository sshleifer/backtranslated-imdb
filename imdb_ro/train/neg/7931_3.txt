The explosion of television channels must be grateful to the Western production line Randolph Scott, because at any moment there must be one of what seems to be a hundred Randolph Scott films playing on at least one budget-free station. /> "The man behind the gun" is a typical melodrama that began in the 1950s, with pre-World War II production values, which are based on a crimes of murder-criminality criminally melted with action scenes to hides the complete absence of the character development scenario,. In the years to come, the role of these films will be taken over by TV shows such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza", etc. - and they actually did the job better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly at this, is a good guy, fighting against the bad guys against whom he will ultimately prevail. He no longer cares about what passes through emotion but what his horse feels, if you do not care if the initial misunderstandings are solved with the woman who leads to the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than the act. But it's good if that's your boat floating; and I would not have let you enjoy "Diagnosis, Crime" either. Worker, pedestrian and rapid aging. 3 stars to be put together; 0 for artistic effort.
