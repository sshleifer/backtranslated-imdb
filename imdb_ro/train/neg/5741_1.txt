<br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror / sci-fi regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror films late at night on cable and video, this must be the worst of all the movies. With bloody special effects (which looked like a steak covered with fake blood or ketchup, which continued to be repeated and repeated) and people running around screaming from the left, then on the right, then back again. She should have stayed with the store store scene and stopped there and it was 15 minutes. Instead, it's dragged a long time. It is very, very x5 budget low. Many scenes have been so, too long. The Narrator sounded very amateur as a random person going out of junior. This is the only film that is inferior to my opinion than Manos, Red Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their larger budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake in a whole movie in a frame or better, avoid it as if you were a lot of brains that eat the brain. Of-a-a-a-a-a-see-that-piece-of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Epitome of badly made films, such as infinite. -infinities / 10
