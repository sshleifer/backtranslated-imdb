I grew up looking at the original television series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you right away, there is no comparison. This movie was totally ridiculous with a flying outfit that was alive. A Martian who took different forms. Special effects that looked like something a young child would create. Instead, in the original, characters have been developed and viewers have developed a sense for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight of this film, in fact, was one, when Ray Walston made a final appearance. She wore dark glasses and made references to live on this planet for 30 years as a tribute to the TV series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
