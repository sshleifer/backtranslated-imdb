This film was two and a quarter of terrible hours. Someone please tell me what the point is? I mean, I understand the historical setting. It is supposed to be a group of confessions confessions (terrorists) on the Missouri-Kansas border, taking revenge against all sympathizers and abolitionists in the north during the US Civil War. But, besides free violence, this film did not have much to import. Perhaps it was a political statement? Is this war nothing more than free violence? If this were the point where it was done pretty well, but I do not think it was the point. I think the producers really thought they did a good movie here, but, for me, it was devoid of any plot. It looks like I could look at a novel in my hand, with characters that look like what you will see on the covers of such books. This movie should be burned along with some of the cities this burned band!
