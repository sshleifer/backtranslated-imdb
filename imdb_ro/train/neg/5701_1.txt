So the great rewriting of history continues the Hollywood style. This was a ridiculous garbage collector. His shocks are that such amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most controversial, misplaced film I've ever seen. It's scary. Nic Cage's short flare with a serious act seems to have ended. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in a different lithium of terrible movies. Diane Kruger proves that her interpretation of Troy was not fluke, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself because he was working on such stamps. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for those recovering from recent lobotomy or people who believe that America invented the world.
