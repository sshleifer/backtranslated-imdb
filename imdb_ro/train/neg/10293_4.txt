My wife and I are watching a movie every night without distraction, and especially artistic movies that require thinking. I have a lot of patience for the movies that are trying to flourish. My wife has the double the attention I do. Everything is said - this movie is simply empty and HELP! She did not go anywhere. She never blossomed. It started out loud, with a promising plot ... then fried biscuits ... going to Spain ... getting angry, she's watching ... the credits are rolling. Uniformly, full of holes, fake start and endless endings. We have gone through several extended sequences of hers, with my eyes in space. The artificial depth was involved when he played with mud and wept. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautiful chicken blow that pretends to be profound or artistic. You will never know or understand Morvern at all. Almost halfway you do not take care. We just wanted to see that at least one of the plot lines develops. Do not waste your time on this. I'm shocked that the scores are so great.
