I've been looking at this ... let me rephrase ... suffered through this because I'm a fan of Eve. I do not think that's a shot he'll put on the back of his head photos. I like the gangsta flix, but that was not even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars and that the money was probably spent on the catering company. The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before she had the chance to care for her or not. I do not bother telling who did what and how, because it's not worth the effort. I'm glad that due to the monthly rental plan at the local film store, I did not have to pay for this garbage. Before you set on fire, I like the movies, I thought a lot of flix was good, some of you stuck, so for me to block you that tells you everything you need to know.
