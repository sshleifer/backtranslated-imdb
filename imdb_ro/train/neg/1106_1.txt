Do not waste your time in this game. As portrayed, characters do not have redemption values ​​and watching them interact is pure torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, that's stupid. If you like to watch pretentious and spoiled poets striving to overtake you, this can be right in the alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete robbery, and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly amazing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only person with any backbone, but even she leaves all the effort without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See the Gothic instead. I also remember that I saw another superior film based on the same theme but did not get the title. I was hoping that would be, but no such luck. Not recommended.
