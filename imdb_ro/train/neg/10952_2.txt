I do not like how this movie has no creative contribution. I know they will be realistic, but be honest that I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can handle the low production values, hell, I'm a sucker for low production values, but at least I'm working on some good ideas. The direction goes just as much as you take a video camera and walk a little, but obviously it should dig it, because it makes things more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama was basically life, with dull cuts. I can only conclude that it is not a drama, not a long shot. We'll see Rosetta going to one place, Rosetta is working in a bakery, Rosetta is eating a waffle, Rosetta wearing bags away, Rosetta going home, Rosetta going somewhere ... it's not that fun. It has no deeper meaning. I was so bored that I started looking for some reflections about life in this movie, but it's just a clear realism, the most exaggerated quality in business. I think I should love this, but come on, there's nothing there.
