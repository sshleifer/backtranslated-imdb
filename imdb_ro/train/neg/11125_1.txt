Hey, look, do it, there are much better portraits of black American weight than that. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is directed towards the poor execution of the story, which I mentioned, blows. This was done in the mid 80's and is horrible in the music / scoring team. It's funny to see Oprah like a late-guy kind of bitch. The scene where Bigger Elizabeth McGovern arrives in the incinerator. The purely classic cinema. First of all, I do not care how drunk you are, you will react to the 1200F flame (no matter how bad you act). But they really ate that scene ... it was comic. I'll tell you, however, I was very pleased to see Elizabeth McGovern burn in a false death; pisses me off.
