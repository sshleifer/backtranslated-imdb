This movie has some fatal flaws in it, as someone could go through an open back door of a very secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then the same person just walks around the building and enters the doctor's office, it's just a bad writing or a bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made, except that she was filmed in Canada and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. If you are not really bored and there is nothing else to watch on TV then I say it will kill some time but otherwise it is a movie that no actor will want in their resume.
