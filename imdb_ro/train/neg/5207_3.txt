An anemic comedy drama, an unfortunate and seemingly stormy business, in which Cher is a housewife who slowly turns and makes friends with the man who has been hired to kill her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the engaged gunman, adapted the scenario from his own game, with set-ups of stagy and dialogue-back-and-forth that quickly tightened his eye and ear. A dark air hangs along the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can not pull Cher out of her perpetual funnel (she's apparent). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance to the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 from ****
