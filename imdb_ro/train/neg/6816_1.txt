I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so it was not my problem with her. My problem is that I felt I was watching my neighbor's home movie. IMO all about it seemed like a guy wrote a quick story, took a room and started shooting. I understand how hard I have to do this effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I expect to feel like I'm looking at a type of professional film. John Schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was good in this movie. The others in him were not. I understand how it should be fun and cheaper to use friends and relatives as distributors, but it does not mean it should be convincing. It seems to be the way he was shot, he tried to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when writing, plot and acting are there for the beginning, that style of style is not necessary, and it's a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also at the technical level, it has digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all these fine cars, when they did a slow scan, they seemed to wander a little back and forth. The problem is not in my viewing equipment, (Benq PE-8700 "diagonal"), but somewhere in production, I've never seen a kind of artifact in a professional movie, then it was the sound. they did not make a voice, which can be ok if it does not sound like the song in this movie sounds like the built-in microphone on the camera.
