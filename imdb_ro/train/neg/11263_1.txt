To shame, to shame that a good actor, such as Joseph Fiennes, would have allowed to be thrown into this piece of nausea. The film was not only bad, but also horrible downward and with no ransom. Plan, (was it one?) It seemed to not work somewhere. The Russians played killer games or were killed, and the rest of the camp should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the road and turned it off. A "1" for awful just because there is nothing smaller. Do not waste your time with this, you will not lose anything.
