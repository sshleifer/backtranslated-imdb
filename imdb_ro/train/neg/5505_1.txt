Shazbot, that's embarrassing. In fact, here is a list of 100 that makes embarrassment: 1.) an unsuccessful comeback for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels played virtually the same role he played in the live 101 Dalmatians remake, which was not too juicy to start. She sure has a fun way to promote her purple roses theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney what Jet Li was for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original martial artist in the TV series, played a small part (read "cameo") in this film and died two years later from lupus. Coincidence? 6.) terrible special effects. Really - terrible. 7.-100.) That speech-sucking suit, expressed at an annoying level by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! HA ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Look ... Hi. You're a joke. Okay, let's end this review with a silent moment for the aggressive death of this franchise, and if you want, you can say a quick prayer that Disney does not forget this travesty and does something stupid as an adaptation of "Mork and Mindy" with Tim Allen ............................................. ..... .......
