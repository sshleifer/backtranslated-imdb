Frank Capra's creativity must have been almost spent when he made this film. While he has some charming moments and many wonderful performers, Capra's absolute resumption of not only the script, but also the considerable recordings in his first version of Broadway Bill (1934), is impressive. It is understandable that he will re-use the movie from the climatic horse race, which is thrilling. But he uses whole scenes of dialogue with minor actors, then brings back those actors and expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years old! If you do not want to see one of Oliver Hardy's latest appearances, skip him and watch Broadway Bill.
