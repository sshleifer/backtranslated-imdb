For me, this is just a soap opera. I think any emergence of disgusting people can be considered a "social comment". But in the last analysis, I simply do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters is very lively and can not engage. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there's a love story here, she's getting sick. And in spite of the end of the twist of a complete and immediate (and therefore misunderstood) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand, the story is insufficient to keep my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are thrown into, this story is lingerie, melodramatic and tribune. Rock Hudson is noble wood. This is Lauren Bacall's least involved role and one of the poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack offer more inspirational performance, but her character is bitter and pathetic. Robert Keith, as loving and touchless father of two adult children, is the most sympathetic. The most interesting of all, however, is Robert Wilke with a severe look, in a small role as owner of the bar. Best it is remembered as a bloody bastard in many Western, but here he is an honest and pleasant. I take my social commentary with an interesting, interesting story and some nice characters, thank you.
