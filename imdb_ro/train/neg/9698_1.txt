There are many very talented producers / actors in Germany now. None of these are associated with this "movie". Why do producers in the world actually invest money in something like that? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this garbage! It's not fun to have 7 older men like dwarfs, pretending to be funny. What's funny is that the filmmaker (who happens to be the oldest guy in the group) plays the youngest dwarf. The film is full of moments screaming for subtitles saying, "You're supposed to laugh now!" It's hard to believe that this stupidity should be a comedy. Many people actually got up and left the cinema for 30 minutes in the movie. I should have done the same thing instead of losing my time ... Pain!
