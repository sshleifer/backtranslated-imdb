This does not really make blues justice. He starts out with the pictures of the voyager's son and Blind Willie McTell (or was somewhat blind Jefferson, someone blind, anyway) who seems to have told about cosmic space (?) And told us the life stories of different blues musicians. Corny as it is, this may be the most interesting part of this documentary from a visual point of view. After that, the only thing you have to see is that the incompetent actors are bursting with the classic songs taped at the black-black, Beck and Shemekia Copeland intersection, violating the same songs afterwards. This is a good device to show us why the old Blues were really so wonderful, but they do not make convincing views. There is almost nothing here to justify the transformation of the film into a movie and not a radio game. No one should be forced to see these wrong rehabilitation. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for Blues. Avoid at all costs.
