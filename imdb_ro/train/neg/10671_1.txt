MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. First, find out that the shooter has no bank account or history since he left the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person ever be allowed to be close to a president, not to mention a high visibility service. Also, the head of security for POTHUS would not be so excited to start drinking in the fog if the president was shot. This movie was sucked. I can not express the extremes of this film. Every actor was terrible. Even the chicken from the trailer park. I'm sick of this garbage. What a waste of time.
