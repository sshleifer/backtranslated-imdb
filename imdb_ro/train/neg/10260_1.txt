This movie was terrible! I hired him without knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and I knew it was a bomb. The actor was bad and there was no plot. The monster is soooooo fake. the mouth does not move. Also why would a doctor play a xylophone to kill the monster. Very bad do not waste your time. (1 of 10)
