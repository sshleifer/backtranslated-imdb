If the writer / director reads this (and I imagine you are since you should stop working now), then I have to tell you - I have seen some bad movies in my time, but it makes the distinction of having the worst you have ever heard SPOILS - Nothing is happening! <br /> <br /> A total loss of time I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (if the whole movie she was in a coma then the scene where she sleeps with this guy means someone raped them while they were taken out?) <br /> Delete garbage.
