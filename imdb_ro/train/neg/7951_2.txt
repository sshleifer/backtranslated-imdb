I gave him a "small score" not because it was a bad movie, but because he did not do anything worth praising. I have not seen any work of Hsiao-hsien Hou before, but for the uninvited (included in me) "Kôhî jikô" is published as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was so in 1962) The film is an extremely small work ... which contains very little dialogue, story, music or emotion. Yo Hitoto interprets "Yoko" unemployment, a wandering character who spends time in the local confectionery or easily investigates a Taiwanese composer who likes it. Tadanobu Asano plays her girlfriend, who works in a cd store and occasionally hears his interest in otaku on trains. And that's all we care about. We notice Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for a train ... catching a train ... sleeping the train. The kind of worldly reality that anyone in Japan can see on a daily basis. Hou captures these common moments of these characters' lives, but without any meaning for these vignettes is a completely useless movie to do or watch.
