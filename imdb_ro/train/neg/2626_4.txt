We have seen this film years ago in a group tradition of the Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we set out to rent a bunch of B movies and vote for who chose the worst. The night I looked at it was voted the best because of the plot and fun costuming. This is certainly a bad film, kitschy, to be pursued under the complete understanding that you look at the low budget puff. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave your own sign on you. It made quite an impression on me that I actually tried to get a copy of it for a few years. A good choice if you're down to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
