I have to say the first time I watched this movie about 6 years ago, and actually I enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and at a second watch I wondered why I liked it. The act was terrible and, as usual, we have stereotypical clans in their fake costumes. The actor was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. The plot line was good, but the execution was poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed so in the movies. Braveheart was even worse, however, which is just the film that saves grace. But seriously, people did not talk that way in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glasgow accents? Just another movie that tries to capture the essence of the already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice that the only people who say that this movie is good are the Americans and, to be honest, I can see why they would like them, they know they have a fire for the men in Kilts. However, if you're thinking about buying the DVD, I'd say you spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
