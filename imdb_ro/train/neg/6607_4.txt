Not as bad as some make, though obviously pathetic to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great like the bastard Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original because obviously they did not work with the same effect. Apart from some mediocre scenarios, the rest of the movie is wrong. The character's development was poor, and the development of this story was hopeless, with many gaps and lack of information that I would not have known if I did not read the back of the DVD box. The worst part of the film was the support roles of Nisha Kothari and, in particular, this new guy named Prashant Raj. Nice is simply annoying from the opening of your lips. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is it and why was it on the ground present in the movie studio for something other than serving drinks? Its ability to act is zero and has the same tone, a dialogue distribution and a firm expression in every scene, whether it's action, comedy or even a scene when someone just died. Ajay Devgan was on average, at least his expressions have changed, which is more than I can say for his company mistake. Overall, Rag's Aag deserves to be watched for Amitabh's solid performance and also a very sexy, Urmilla Matondkar, in a special appearance.
