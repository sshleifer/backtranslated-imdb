The world could have ended. Unfortunately, this film has survived as yet another proof of Canada's inability to make films that go beyond excessive powers. Maybe because all our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's too bad Short has not been expressed in this pretentious and trivial film. It would have given credibility. The Canadian government should realize - and this movie is a magnificent example - that the shot of money in the trough does not result in a good cinema. If they had to compete with the people who were raising these public funds, they would have had to come up with something valid. As they have produced yet another scary embarrassment.
