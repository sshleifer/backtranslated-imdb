This long-lasting film turns out to be less about Berkowitz and its effect on the NYC, but more about the cartoon paintings of a certain group of Italian-Americans, locally known as "Guidos." The problem is that "Guidos" is uninteresting, no matter what kind of story or setting are sinking. They're already live cartoons, so Lee amplifies them, not just portray them. someone has a caricature made by themselves, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make our ears and even bigger nose!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the Guido lifestyle. Start with an uninteresting story for the characters, especially for John Leguizamo, and you'll get a nice movie to fall asleep. Especially taking into account its long time. Another coup against him: for someone who proclaims to be a Yankees fan and grew up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to write Phil Rizzuto, which is written incorrectly in closing credits.
