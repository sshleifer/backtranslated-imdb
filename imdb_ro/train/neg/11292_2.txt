Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for treasure sunk in the South Atlantic. Wilde's treasure hunters fight with a group of territorial sharks with cute sneakers on their hungry faces. Wilde and his happy people have to find a way out of the menu so that they can begin excavating an old Spanish gale filled with gold bullion. After the crew engages in a little push eternity, arguing and listening to Wilde's health advice, five crazy condemns climb the ship and complicate things. Now is a battle of wisdom about who receives the treasure and who gets to see what it means inside a stomach of a shark. At least Wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing that The Naked Prey wore 10 years earlier and stayed in excellent condition. Made out of a 75-cent budget.
