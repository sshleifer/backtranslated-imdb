I made a great effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome. On the paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope - I liked Pacino in "Scent of a Woman" and I saw Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French films and other films of the 70/80s. But I forgot how important the partial dialogues are in a movie, and in this movie I am absolutely ..... garbage! Filming locations were also attractive, but hopeless, demanding and forced dialogues brought everything to a level below zero. Besides, I'm quite allergic to the racing world and I'm not interested in this sport. Even the in-love dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and that's what it says!). We were really looking forward to this movie and I was very disappointed that he was so disappointed.
