I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was looking forward to seeing this episode. I will comment on the first film, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie: Gets talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a $ 1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, to boring and lifeless. Serve cold in a large stone boiler. Film, give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I'll admit that, the first time I saw her, I fell asleep halfway down the road. I understand it was the reaction of a few other people. However, when I looked at it the second time, I realized there was a whole series of clever references and good lines that I lost for the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes a few views to catch each line. Give her a second chance and you'll see what I mean. Episode MST3K: 7 1/2 of 10.
