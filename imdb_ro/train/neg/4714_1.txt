I want so bad to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero, unfortunately, not so, I had to give him one 1 to warn you about how terrible this impostor of a familiar cartoon is! Characters show that they were drawn by pre-schoolers, not wait, I saw the pre-schoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! Probably say what the others said, two words: RIP OFF! Remember that episode of Dexter's lab when they competed with motorcycles down the volcano? yes, Miss Fellows really got that idea and they failed! They even broke Shadow Lugia in that episode that parodied Pokemon! (He even earned that franchise!) One character is a cheap extraction of Mandark from Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows must be sued for the legal breach of this piece of nonsense! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like Johnny's Test (RIP-OFF) are lying to you alone. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this extraction tries to disturb your screen!
