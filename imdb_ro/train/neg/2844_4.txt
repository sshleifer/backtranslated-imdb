This is one of the most serious films made by Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It's so painfully clichtered, and the dialogue is so terrible that it's not something that neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud to do. Gable is a helicopter whose illegal activities result in a girl who goes "slammer (like the gangster?"). She gives her hope that she will do what she needs, but only leaves her there - unknown to any of them, ma'am, that is "in a family." Eventually, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow binds them all in a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable needed to do the rap and spend some years in hoosegow Leonard Maltin says that "the stars are the best here." What is the best standard for producing unintentional chants? Give him a break PS - after saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin will find me and it will hit me. "Hmmm, however, despite my comment, I think Mr. Maltin is the best reviewer and man on the planet (I hope I have him quiet). I liked this movie so much for the first time (in the with the ridiculous end), I decided to see it again. After all, sometimes when I look at a movie again I like much more and I realize I was a bit too tough. While this has been the case for more films in recent months, I still enjoyed this movie - even the second time. Most were not because of the first half of the movie. In the first half of the year, Harlow's character was amazingly bad, but at least he was credible. But when she was sent to prison, they were clinging to the last ridiculous scene of the marriage. The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassing - it is simply meaningless and is like turning the movie into a crazy story instead of a love story about two mistakes. I'm staring at the original (despite all the "Nels") and I think apart from PARNELL and eventually POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it could be just the worst Gable movie.
