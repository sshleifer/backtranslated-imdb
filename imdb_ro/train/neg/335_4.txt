Michael Jackson claimed a spot for the top-charged character in THE CHILD GOLDEN, and because he loves children. That did not work (and why should she do that?) So I let Eddie Murphy save the world by saving Kid Midas. I would strongly suggest that all future screenwriters carefully study the actor's inertial dialogue in this fantasy comic - adventure - which is a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or do, may be best, but do not be misled about his comic talent; he does not belong to this film, and the same thing was for DR. Dolittle! Violence and combined images are reasons to be stamped as a classic worship camp, and that would have made no sense because Hollywood and film fans continued to cash in on the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were extraordinarily amazingly extravagant during Ronald Reagan's presidential celebration. Murphy is much better at AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this old movie is not a honey odor of gold for a sweet, crispy taste.
