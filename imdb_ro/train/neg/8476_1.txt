this movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. Firstly, pouring could have been better; Katyn's main character does not show anything like her mother's TV. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot was pathed. was extremely clich√© and predictable. the conclusion was very disappointing and cheesy. (but that's all I'm saying about it). The nail in the bag, however, was a scene in which Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) had to cry, but the girl could not complain to order! no tears were heard on her face, only a few unbelievable wounds. she is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same false laugh, identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie Maguire (sp?). that's when the movie has gone from not-so good to simply bad. she really looked like she was acting. <br /> <br /> In short: this movie was really bad! was a kind of interplay of every 1990s children's movie, that everyone is sick - just worse! I give her an "F" because it was just so hard to sit through (b / w / w, I was babysitting when I saw him). <br /> <br /> However, you may like it if you are 9 or under. ;)
