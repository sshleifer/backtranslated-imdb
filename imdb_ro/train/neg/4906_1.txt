Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously, this was done for the TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but before or after it seemed to be a painting of the kind of movie numbers. And we talk about bad chemistry between love lovers detectives. <br /> <br /> I would go deeper, but this movie is not really worth it. Grade: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
