It's been almost thirty years and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen. Before I saw this, I did not think too much about Rivers one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I see it accidentally on TV. I dragged on this - against my better judgment - to the pressure of my colleagues. However, coming out of the theater, those friends vowed not to take revenge again for the film's choice. Nearly thirty years later, we continue to have mental scars in this film. On the bed of death, one of my regrets will be the moment when I lost the hope that this movie could get better. I never liked. If you've ever been given a choice, you'd rather put your own eyes in front of this movie. I registered for IMDb comments only hope I can warn others not to see this movie. If I can save only one person from this, then my existence on this earth would have been justified.
