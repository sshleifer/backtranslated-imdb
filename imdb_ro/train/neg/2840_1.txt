Two old friends are sent to Japan to get results from genetic research that contains a video tape that is stolen by the black ninja suited at the beginning of the movie. First, you just have to learn a ninja skill, because "only the ninja can beat the ninja." Sakura murderers try hard to be nice ninja-flick, but it does not get that bad. The whole movie is so blank and predictable that it's hard to say anything good about it: the same plot has been seen in different variants a dozen times before, the characters are too short, the direction is boring, and the script gives nothing surprising, even in the final stage, which, by itself, reduced the value of the film (garbage). Even the 80-ninja-flick fans, who understand the aesthetics of garbage cans, find it hard to find this film. It just does not give anything new to the viewer, neither visually nor in the plot. Shurikens are thrown away, and the katais are balancing, but it is not enough to lead the film direction that it means to be, and recurrent similar scenes count even the most discontented viewer after the first 30 minutes. It's hard to recommend a movie for anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in "Enter the Ninja" falls behind the Sakura killer's American ninjas. Even on a visual level, the movie does not have balls and it's a waste of time to try to find any great fighting scene in this movie: There is none. In all, one of the most useless ninja-strokes I've ever seen. He has no interest in curiosity. Trust me this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
