I went to see this at Tequila Esquire in Cincy, Oh, and - I hate my life now. Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> A movie was painful, but seeing Bret Carr in person was to see desperation at the top. My favorite part of the movie was seeing BC embarrassed in front of what seemed to be a "C" battery. The jury is still on this issue. It was from a vibrator and it was in slow-mo. Yep. <br /> <br /> "Just pull the left side of the face ... people become famous by asking for things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr dressed a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, crossing Clifton's streets, scaring his own film. He should. This is right for bash movie. My soul felt chafed after this movie. Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be a cult leader, or quite smart for that matter. This is the feeling you get from what drips the Bleepesque brainwashing, the impressive neo-yuppies who came to see this Bret Carr piece of work. It's an emotional leakage experience just thinking about writing about this movie, so farewell. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
