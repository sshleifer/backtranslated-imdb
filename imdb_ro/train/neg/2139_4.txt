I really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a bad movie made with too little laugh. Politics is on the scene, I'm going to offend republicans, but that's what it's designed to do. This gives me reason to chicote. The problem is that it appears to have been made in a REAL bunch (like about a week). And it contains a stupid subfield about a bimbo singer who seems to be completely out of the subject. Turikistan is obviously Iraq or Afghanistan or any other country with which the US has since the 1950s. Humor is a bit dark (amputees dancing with prosthetic feet made by the Tamerlane corporation), but it's on the mark, especially with corporations rebuilding ("Democrat lite!") However, a lot of satire that criticizes the United States seems to be be extremely hard and working. I think it is in contradiction with so much bs propaganda, so you have to beat people over your head to do something. Who knows. I prefer more than a nudge approach, wink - a bit of subtlety. But that's just for me. Anyway, I could look again, maybe I missed something. I hope "W" is more branded.
