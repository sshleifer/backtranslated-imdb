A female singer, dubbed "Big T" - seriously, this is what she calls her - risks developing her musical career and life by falling into a drunken drunk (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother has committed suicide, his father is also alcoholic and has a violent temper. You can imagine where it's going. Meanwhile, music is aplenty, like Parton, with fluent vocal talents, song after song (at least half of them about Texas). Avoid this mess and check it instead of NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
