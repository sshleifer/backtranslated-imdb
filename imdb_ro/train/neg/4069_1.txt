good God! (and that comes from an atheist), this movie is bad! Many of those who rated this piece 3 and below were already happy with those who made reviews that I fully agree on, I like to add a few things: among the three guys who had to eat their own products digestive finals were cut off by an Ax, raped by an aunt, beat their balls - ex-boyfriend suffers the worst tortures while listening to the endless and pointless fury of the girl at the kitchen table (just like we also have, but at least we have the mercy of the button). the director cut the cemetery with dots and endless scenes and reversed, our suffering would have ended in 30 minutes. The only things that made this movement at least somewhat bearable are the tits Emily Haack (a point) <br /> <br /> look. do not buy it. Do not waste time. and your health. my brain is so fried after I've seen it I feel the urgent need to track (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" right now.
