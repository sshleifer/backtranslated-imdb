I am an avid B-Rate horror film horror film and have viewed my fair share of slasher photos, so I have a substantial gauge to judge this movie by. It is easily classified into the top episode of the worst horror movies that the 1980s gave. Not as scary as the night of demons, it is not as bad as the Re-animator and does not have the value of the camp No there is nothing there. That being said, this movie has no value. Keep in mind that the artwork is for a completely different film. Photos from DVDs are not taken from this movie. VIOLENCE: $ $ $ (There is a lot of violence, but I have seen it altogether.) A killer kills the students and the occasional member of the facility by cutting their throats and all the other tired methods of killing using horror films) . NUDITY: Nothing STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who has wisely changed his name after Forbes Riley after making this film - accepting a teaching job at a university, people are starting to die Forbes thinks the killer has it in her direction. To be honest, it's impossible to care, because the script does not create any character outside Forbes.) ACTING: $ I feel like a school production - a big school, which is because college students could make a better move than that. Forbes has a modicum of talent as a seminar as one of the students, but anyone else is caliber "extracted" to act).
