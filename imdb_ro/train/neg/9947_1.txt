This movie was horrible. I swear they have not even written a screenplay that they just fed into the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying like hell. * Phht SPOILERS more like reasons not to watch it * They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he could have long gone. The earth was tough, so it was almost impossible to follow him out with dogs. And when ICE-T is on that hill and uses it as a sniper rifle (and then cuts a tree with eight shells, it would take 1000 shells to cut a tree of that size). and machine guns are considered inaccurate at 100 yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflects the light? I did not see a field in that thing. Also, when he was shot in the intestines and continued to walk, he was retarded to bleed right there. In addition, it ends where a stone or a cigarette is in the barrel. He would not be thrown into the air and would not kill him. The bullet still hits the fire to kill Ice T, but to tangle the barrel.
