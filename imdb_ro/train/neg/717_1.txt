It was a parody on the LOTR Trilogy. But this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad is acting, bad scenario, all bad. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I never doubt there are people who will want this feeling of "humor," but there have been more parodies on movies from directors like Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I work in a cinema and in the DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: the films were a nice (but not at all) great success in the first two weeks, but then when the reviews of those who have saw they were not good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for a short time, but then nobody asked for it. In the last ten years, the worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which one is worse, but I'm happy that there are so many good movies, so I do not have to think too much about this question.
