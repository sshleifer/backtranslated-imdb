TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS Appearance: 1.78: 1 Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> At the end of the 19th century, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school at Rugby, where he passed through the reforms of a new radical director (Stephen Fry) and rises to the resident school bomb, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). ("The Heart Is") and director David Moore ("THE FORSYTE SAGA"), which was released by Thomas Hughes. He is rather enjoyable and traceable, but he is rather staid and boring, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new director, determined to remove some of the most "traditions" of the school and by introducing a possible new a star in 14 Pettyfer, a talented child with a charm and a good look that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, it's typical UK feed for animals, the kind of thing favored by executives eager to fill programs with "prestige" products, even an unreasonable one. The British newspaper "Radio Times" described it as "strange weird" and raised a doubtful eyebrow about "all those buzzings and brutality, and a beautiful bastard and shit that tortured the life of sweet boys." Enough.
