Leonard Maltin, often trusted, says it's a "delightful story" and that Sanders is "gorgeous." Maltin must have mistaken this film for something else. Sanders is gentle and glamorous as usual ?? you can imagine delivering his line of adultery, "Sometimes marriage chains are so heavy that they have to be worn three," but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately. The story itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a jewelery thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police, but can hardly resist luring fine jewelry, is quite fun, but has the same type of historical holographic treatment , such epic epic as * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly deplorable * Forever Amber * (who calls for a classic remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders is trying to add a certain depth to his character, it's all about nothing. I am a fan of Douglas Sirk, but this is 1946 and is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature signs that would have defined those who were able to stand up standing. Sirk just hated his feet here and made a series of great movies over the next ten years until he hit gold with Obsessive Magnifica and hit the pitch, bombarding us with such estrogen celebrations as * All Heaven * Written by the wind *, and * The imitation of life *. But * The Paris scandal is hardly his best work? a relatively low business deal with cheeses and an ineffectual costume.
