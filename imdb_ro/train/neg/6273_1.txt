This was a nice movie to the end. The conclusion was just a more worthy effort to shame men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the one who ultimately gave her power and control over her relationship with her. It is no accident that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they left at the end after having to pray and pray with her to take her back. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible to all people and control their relationships with them. It was a desperate film for this reason.
