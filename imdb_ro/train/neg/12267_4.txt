just like a movie, I did not really like it. not because there was no FX or because I had a single cabin as a screenplay for the entire movie, actually that was what keeps me looking at her. I did not like it because the act was shady, its friends are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take distinct roles, one is faithful, the other is the antagonist, but they never put a point! Also, enlightenment was terrible and I only mention the technical problems. In a few words, I think the movie could only have "ok i'm outta here!" from some characters. like the lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. About the story itself, everyone is free to write about what he wants and the story is proof of a good letter and imagination. I believe the author of the book because, therefore, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, finally, you hear the story of man believe or not, just do not spend all the time acting like you being shocked by what he says and at the same time moving and making jokes as if you do not believe him. Coherence. <br /> <br /> thank you for reading;)
