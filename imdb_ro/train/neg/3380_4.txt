The show of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante on Broadway has fled for years, but the evidence of his power and charisma is lost in this adaptation of the film, most likely resulting from the choice of the director (Richard Attenborough, away from B -way) main actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a choreographer as a thin body attorney). The slim story, about a terrifying audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for dancing-dancing actors, is pushed directly by us, with powerful and stunning talent playing on the rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a ridiculous subterfuge about an ex-dancer returning to the theater and Douglas old flame fire heads. Persons filled with hope are full of promises and sufferings, but their personal stories of anger are a little embarrassing; this, in keeping with Attenborough's slow rhythm, triggers disaster, and even the famous songs fail to go through artificial packaging. * 1/2 from ****
