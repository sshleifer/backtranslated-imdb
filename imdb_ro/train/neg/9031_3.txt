The reward is the game that plays in this drama, and the plot of revenge is canceled by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why would a man be involved with the trophy wife of a mafia boss in his gangster's own mansion with suspicious suspects around? Why does a married wife encourage the attention of a complete stranger and expect him to take her with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily afterwards with new love? Of course, the hero, here, Kevin Costner, must have waited for a husband husband's reaction, giving the film an excuse to indulge in gore and meaningless violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he deserves, definitely deserves better, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic figure who suffers a lot as she seizes her charming prince. Stowe is fine, but the Spanish emphasis does not work. The cinemas of the smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo, and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a rock star.
