One of the worst movies I've seen in camera shooting, using the filter, the film was granular, the script was terrible, I mean it comes, how predictable the battle was ... .. <br /> <br /> Some of the battle scenes were fine I think .... some scenes were so bad it was comic ... like Sorbo getting horse and riding at the end .. .LOL I mean really ... a horse? Oh, I can not see how the bad guys are rolling around the same vehicle throughout the movie ... you would think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they would have been pursued. ETC, you really do not mind looking. .
