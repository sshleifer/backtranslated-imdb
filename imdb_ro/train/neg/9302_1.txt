This movie is horrible. It's boring, it's of low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen and the script is so bad it's hilarious. The main actor should be the hot guy who all girls, but it's ugly, overweight and looks like it's from the early 90's. All the characters are gone at the end of the week to meet with friends, but no one is fact friends! The married couple did not see the "main" type in more than 5 years, and even then they were not friends. The "date" of the main guy knows him only from the workplace and there is a girl that I take to a bar. Now tell me you risk losing your job to spend a weekend at your cottage with people who are not really your true friends. Because that's what he's doing at the beginning of the movie! Do not waste a minute of your time on this blade. I made home movies more frightening than that! <br /> <br />
