When I first saw the cover of this movie (a huge bug that follows a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I was not in the Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this hit of cheese, which always does a good job, no matter the role it occupies ... FX are pretty horn, there is not much of a plot, and I'm still not you know why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with the monkey. But come people, what would you expect? It's not as bad as it sounds ... If you're enjoying 50-year-old bug fixes, this is basically an upgraded version without any special FX updates
