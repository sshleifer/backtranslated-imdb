Given its popularity, I found this film a great disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much for this movie. After all, it's one of the most famous martial arts films in the 1970s, but I did not realize why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky film with sporadic sequences of action. The biggest problem with the film was that the story does not offer a character that I can root because the hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style and can not conceal the joke imperfections found in the narrative. I know it should not be a fine art, but I found the boring movie. It is certainly not the best example of this very beloved genre. His worship status is escaping me. I recommend you to skip it.
