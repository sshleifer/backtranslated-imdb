The Men on the Moon Radar is a fairly typical fare of the 1950s series. The special effects are quite cheap, the monthly rovers are obviously surplus jeeps from the Second World War, painted plywood over them and the like . The actor is just that. It inspires the imagination of the children I think it was directed to. By today's standards, it is boring, cheap and bad. There is also a large amount of images in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
