I love these actors, but they were wasted in this movement. I can only wonder what they thought I agreed with this stupidity ??? Debra Winger just called her in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was profound. If you liked Breaking the Waves, you probably would love that too. I hated both of them. 3/10
