In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (in the role of Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) supervise the wedding of their children, Anita Page (Helen) and Norman Foster (John). Before the feast, Ms. Dressler turns the rulers of his small bank into his town, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial uncertainty. Banker Foster is able to survive, thanks to Dressler's wise planning. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her wealth and demands a complete retreat. Other "Warren Bank" customers hear Moran hearing and start questioning their solvency. Soon, the family is in financial crisis. Dressler's huge, critically acclaimed film, Emma, ​​was released early on, and MGM had wanted to get a new Dressler movie as soon as possible. Dressler's Impressions of 1931, "Reducing" and "Politics", still made a lot of money; and Dressler became the box office in the United States in 1932, according to a list of industry standards compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" has certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but production seems unusually negligent and rushed. Distribution is good, considering. Some more care in the direction and editing, and some reps, would have helped ?? apparently, they need it in the theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dresser, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
