Actually, a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there were a few things that hit me. The first was the use of mute epithets. In two cases, Scott's character is found once, once in the beginning when he abandons his bomb during the bombardment ("dammit"), and once it tries to influence a bomb to be a pilot ("s *% t "I could be mistaken for the second instance, but I resumed it several times, and so it seems to me." The third case is that the character Anne Shirley desires goodbye O ' Brien goodbye and good luck ("give hell") He probably thought he was too unhappy because he said clearly "heck." I also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing, especially the bombing of civilians. The senior Aviva official assures that only the military targets will be hit by the precision of the bombardment used. Given what we know about LeMay's later strategy of destroying the Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene plays little or so No. I remember McNamara's quote about LeMay in "The Fog of War," meaning that if the US did not win the conflict, it would have tried as a war criminal. The end is much more supple, consistent with the movie. He reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (do not compare the movies, just the end!). Maybe just because it's blowing. Well looked good!
