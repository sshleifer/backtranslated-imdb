Generally, I discovered that if you do not hear about a movie before you see it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it. I did not hear anything about this movie until I was in a blockbuster the next day and I saw it on a shelf. Because all the good movies have already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I'd give it a shot. It's not really much different than other genre films like The Singles Ward or RM If you're in those type movies, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you are not a Mormon, the movie will probably not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid the religious message (mormon) that is found inside of it, and sometimes it happens as a moppy and cheesy. Finally, if you do not fit into the demographics of Mormons, you probably better look at something else. Of course, there were really fun moments in the movie, but I did not think it was enough to save the movie as a whole.
