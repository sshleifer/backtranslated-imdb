Somewhere buried very deep inside this movie is a decent film that is trying to get out. The only traces are some early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a cemetery) and then some production patterns. As I say, buried very deeply. One of the greatest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how the characters react reliably in unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (probably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) A werewolf is, if I remember, according to; "Oh really?". This is not one of the better answers to this challenge. Those who continue to seize continue as the story goes to Trannsylvania, looking for Stirba (the apparently nominated director) "Queen of the Werewolves". As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the best thing in the movie. Yes, even better than the group-sex werewolf scene, the role of Reb Brown and the weird witchcraft of similar. Final credits have a legendary status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie has the same meaning. If you happen to get caught on American television, the credits were drafted to replace Danning's repeated shot that broke it from above with another repeated, repeated blow of her break, opening a cloak just this the date has a kind of peak underneath. It's a kind of absurdity, a cherry-on-top moment defying satire.
