Unfortunately, this movie has no original credit. Nicholas Cage, pretty wood, as the actors go, immerse the screen with a variety of abilities from, ne-plussed up over the top. Support support is not better. Complot remains the same as the original in terms of stage progress, but it is much worse. Not enough detail is provided to allow the audience to enter what is being sold. Looks like it's just a bad thing. Mistrust can not be suspended, nor can a doubt be given. The only rescue aspect of this movie is that it is very visible, as the environment is required, and who sought the location should be praised. There was a lot of public laughter and more booze, literally at the end of the year. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to come to TV, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
