I've given this 1. There are so many twists of plot that you can never be sure you will root. Total chaos. Everyone is killed or close. I'm tired of cross hair and vision change. I can not give the plot away. Convulte and crazy. If I had paid to see this, I would ask for my money back. I would like the reviews to be more honest.
