Behavior, character development and gangs in this movie are extremely weak. A waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace should make someone feel warm and steady, as if the characters were raised through their battles. There has been no such development to make such hot fuzzy feelings possible. Drug gangs are played and much of the movie does not sound real to life. Plot builds what is supposed to be tension, but the characters are not developed enough to care for them. Then she hurries through a resolution of all the outstanding issues in a minute of the screen, letting the spectator feel he has lost time.
