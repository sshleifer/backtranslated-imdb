It was not all: it had rhythm, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the landscape. He also had a decent script. That scratched my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" about a career, why does he have a manager (and why is he losing his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists," why do they sign up for "The Mother of All Jiggle Shows" (like "Brady Bunch" where Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare just to find BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not starving. And while they had the right of history (the poster was released before Farrah had the show), Silverman dismissed the grounds for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promising Tori's little girl did not happen . What disturbed me was how the Spelling role is distorted. He was introduced as a runner and creator when there was none. And how "comes" with the "idea" for CA was ridiculous! How did Spelling and Goldberg allow Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why did Farrah or Bernstein not tell them he was leaving not because he discovered the Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted to do it? That's why when she attempts to try to create conflicts and tensions, putting Farrah into the scene as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), she fails because the foundation has never been laid - there was the place where the painting was delivered company "Three".
