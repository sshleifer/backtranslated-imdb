In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a horror movie to the "thinker." Wow, you could say, sign me. This is a mess. She has a young one-time actress who has a variety of genres from 1 to 2. G. Headley with a British accent (doubled) and a story without chills, emotions or leaks. it's not even interesting. One will only laugh at its cheap and long-lasting effects for a Leprechaun 5. The story involves a girl with a glandular fever that escapes her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, a house of art or even a special school after school. I woke up after two hours said ... where I spent two hours. The direction is uninspired and I wanted to be really pretentious ... something interesting ... it seems the producers were on lithium. Even in the dream world things are boring. A short not on this.
