Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. Well, Tremori first writers are officially out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for a direct price to the video. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very boring movie. Where the heck are Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative shortage of grabs during the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this serial entry is supposed to be a 'character study'. Unfortunately, there is not an interesting character in the movie, except the character of Billy Drago, who are given too few lines, too little to do and, finally, too little screen time. What saved the second and third film was Michael Gross's presence as Burt Gummer. Whenever there is no action on the screen, you can rest assured that Burt Gummer will be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this film Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good, but that's as good as it gets. impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes. Pretty good for direct video. But after seeing her, I'm sure this movie is good for 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue that are boring and no plot. Was there a lot to do this movie? I think it does not, it should have spent more time and it should have been spent on the script. I thought I hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packed for sale with ... Tremors !!! How fortunate I thought you were paying for # 4 to get # 1 for free. Well, after seeing Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and I got this mess for free, I can not imagine paying a single penny for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins really does exist. Tremors 4: The Begins Legend Loses 3 out of 10.
