This piece of nonsense could have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it's one of the most racist films ever made with native American Indians played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, just like his close friend, John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired by "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived short-life series) just because Williams was black. As if it were not bad enough, this film is very dated and boring. Look at "Dance with Wolves" instead of a less racist look. Stewart was in the forties when this horrible movie was made, and even with the ridiculous wig he still showed it as a 16-year-old pedophile - Debra Paget. I'm surprised it was even allowed. 0/10.
