Well, I like to be honest with all the audience I bought because of Kira's sexual scenes, but unfortunately I have not seen much of them. All sexual scenes were short and they were strangely done along with all the strange and horn music, just like all the other B movies - it just does not look too much like two sex people. There's a bit of a plot to the end - Kira's new boyfriend is a killer. Uau !!! how shocking! Why not nominate this movie for the Oscar? I can not imagine how bad the movie would look if it had been R-rated (Mine is imported from the UK, called 18). Conclusion? Put it down and leave so you do not advise to be a moron like me. Score: 2/10
