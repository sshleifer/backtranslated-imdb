CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every movie I choose to see in the theater is at least fun or has something to say. This film showed that it was directed by a film introductory student. in the Filmmaking class. His father makes great movies. His sister did a good one. But Roman brother? NOT! A critic had the daring to compare this film with Godard's Le MÃ©pris (Contempt). While Coppola, Jr. took the same idea, a film about the film, he tried too much to make himself European, artistic and spiritual when everything was just kitsch. The lead actor carries the same expression throughout the film, as though he is either in admiration or in shock of this film being made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to take his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is okay. The only scene that actually has any reality of the film is, surprisingly, not B film scenes, but one that takes place in Italy; a montage of photos of several different characters in a very small car, driving around picking-up and abandoning random people. That was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I guess they were trying to beat him. Or rip-off. Or both. The documentary with the leadership who spoke in the room and filming various objects was played, the end was marked for the sake of a "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing about this movie was the movie itself, and not as it intended. No wonder this movie was sent back after a screening festival was re-edited or re-shot or something else, which makes me curious how bad it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse than that. If you want to see a good parody of the movie, check out Austin Powers. Any one of them. The opening to the third is more fun and brilliant than this whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to targeting cow music videos. Leave Nasii to Dad.
