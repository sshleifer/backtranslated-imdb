I was wrong or is the 2007 version only a rupture of the original? I have to ask you because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad acting, bad editing etc ... the only aspect of "exploitation" here is how we have been kidnapped money buying this piece of nonsense. It's nothing but a soft porn tab ... no real gore, no frightening images, just a piece of garbage made cheap. If someone wants to see an excellent movie without name actors, a slim gore and a decent story ... to take Baby Blood ... also made on an inexpensive but well-done budget ... and a real story too! a loss of money, but I'll just keep it for a laugh ... it's pathetic! New Comment .... Sept 3 ..... I'll keep this movie forever just because it's too bad is almost good ... in a very bad way .... the worst actor ... real carp -child movie!
