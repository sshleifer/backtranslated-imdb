Most films have been disturbed by the Hindi cinema, especially by Sunny and his family The film is typical of the Sunny type, with beats, big dialogs and melodrama The film also has typical Rajiv The Heavenly Ingredients of Many Owners and a Weird Character <br /> <br /> The start is fine and then the transition to Kenya is good, but then the movie continues and continues The sequence of events is moving at a slow pace and nothing happens so well. There are many stupid scenes, like Kenyan policemen are shown as jokers, especially Sharat. The climax is also prolonged Rajiv Rai does a good job Music is fine, only 1 song works and it is the last TOOFAN The work-room is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, Chunky acts as a monkey while serious scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is good that heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri does not even have a scary half as in TRIDEV the rest are good
