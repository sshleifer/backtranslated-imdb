Perhaps someone has heard of Alberto Tomba. A former cop, a former champion of the sky, and now a TERRIBLE actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was planned to be a "mini-serial" TV, but Italian television itself refused to show the film on its channels. Now it's an incredible movie, believe me. The script is simply hilarious (it should be a dramatic film), something like a 5-year-old. But what really breathes you is the amateur actor: Alberto Tomba, who was not really credible as a cop himself, plays horribly an absolutely stupid character: an Italian special police officer specializing in dismantling open doors! ("aries" is "ram"). This super-guy will try to save a nice young life (a true Italian television show "Little Showgirl", married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): beautiful but absolutely inept in acting. Leave him and do a favor. A film that is a shame for the Italian film industry: just John Travolta of Earth Attack has come close.
