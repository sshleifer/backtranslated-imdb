What do you do when you act badly, steer poorly, scenes that are long lasting, terrible illumination, painful editing, and terrible effects? You will get Jessica: A Ghostly Story It seems that shot on betacam, which is good, but enlightenment has to compliment this environment. In this case, no. There are some CU where the face is in the shade. A scene in particular is the scene for psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily have been cut in half ... but I think then they would not have a length-length movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD man, so he should have some "hero" elements of his character, but he does not. He screams and the whole movie is scared. I could go on, but I do not want to waste my time. Though enlightenment was terrible, I have to say that they had a beautiful motion of the room. Too bad that the illumination did not compliment them. The cover of the DVD is nice and there it ends. Just terrible.
