If Mr. Cranky had evaluated this, I would be tempted to copy his review and stick it here. But, as she did not, I would have to give him one way. The only thing that gives a movie instead of 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's role is excellent. However, even he can not save this movie from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on it because it is just a conglomerate of scenes that were thrown together with little continuity - recalling the bad movies of the '70s. Even worse, both the actors and the director seemed to do everything while they were going, which probably showed how bad the original scenario was. It is not even worth discussing the story line, although it is spinning around a futuristic perspective. The corporation called the Proxate Corporation, which has put together a crew of dispensable persons to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container / slave ship in Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a child kept in a glass jar and bound in one of the crew by USB 12 or something. The company should have been called "Prostate Corporation," because the entertainment value of this film is similar to an examination of the same name. I honestly can not find a scene that I could say well done and did any real sense in the context of the movie. I looked up to the end when I touched the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people worse than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not keep this against him because he is a great actor and every great actor has the right to a bad movie in their career and this is a dousie. So unless this is your only film the store hires or you're a man and you're the doctor do not do prostate exams this week and you somehow feel it's a bad thing then give it a really big place , unless, of course, if you are a true mind community, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.
