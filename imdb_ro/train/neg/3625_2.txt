This is a film that is firmly in the 1950s. Surprisingly, the American Film Institute chose this film for one of the top 100 American films of all time. I have seen virtually all the movies on that list, and this is by far the most disappointing of them. Musical numbers (and many, many of them) are very long and boring and have absolutely no connection with the story. The end of the movie has a dazzling ballet sequence, which naturally has no real connection with the story of the movie. We have to admit that it is very well done, music is good and dance done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason for the sequence to be included in the film. <br /> <br /> The film's main character is extremely natural and indifferent and behaves rude. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical made of the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the rain".
