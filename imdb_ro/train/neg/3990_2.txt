The fever of the jungle is too stylized, stereotyped, and it happens to be essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes mistaken for lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even if there are many talents in this movie, it is more scattered because the pieces are reduced to just a little more than decorative houses. Also, instead of simply showing racism for the nasty and stupid thing, Spike Lee chooses to surround him like a flag in a very weeping and irritating manner. I've done it for most of the movie, but I have not managed to end it too much, and that for me is rare.
