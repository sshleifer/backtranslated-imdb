Incredible. Does it have more than that? No chance. The stupidity of this film would be ashamed even by Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had a mediocre dialogue and the second had bad dialogue, then it has a crisp dialogue. Amazing. But this time the story was also reduced to dialogue. In spite of acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The totally moronic delight therefore comes from the pen of a frustrated left. I sometimes wonder if these leftists really realize how much antidemocracy and pro-dictatorship are. Is this film obviously aimed at the US? a democracy. Why not target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-military films? Sure, most of these places probably do not produce a cube like this soon, but that's out of the way. It is obvious that garbage writers like this often admire these regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would go so far as to say that someone attacking the American foreign policy always has antidemocratic beliefs at its center. Back to the film: Apart from being so far away that it is not even funny, the film has many obvious illogicities. For example, for two reasons, the two men who have supervised the cube have done it for a while and are indifferent to the pain and sadism involved in the project, yet the first of them suddenly comes back against the system! Anyone who has any idea of ​​human nature will even see this idiocy. Or about that shrewd character, a bad office with an eye that speaks like it's in a bad comedy by Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the movie loses ALL seriousness and therefore any chance of being interesting: it really becomes a comedy.
