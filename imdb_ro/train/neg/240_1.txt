I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I really have to do it. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost him. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with cheese wedding videos. Vivah is so cheese that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. There was no time during the movie, where I can say "Oh, at least that's good". Aloknath makes the clich√© in the role of father of the girl, Shahid kapoor shows fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster, in addition to ugly sets, poor costumes, stingy story, monstrous stepmother, actors hard to act, music cacophony, cheap soundtracks. Now, the spoiler, I warn you that, as is the case in all of her other films, after a disastrous hit film ends on a happy note.
