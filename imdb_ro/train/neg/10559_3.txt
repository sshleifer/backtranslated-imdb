- I do not understand. None of this makes sense! "Excites an exasperated character to the end of Death Smiles at Murder.When I have gone through this very confusing disorder of a movie, I know exactly how he feels." The story by film director Aristide Massacessi (the old old Joe D'amato, who uses his real name for a change), is a lewd mixture of supernatural, murderous and mysterious trash, who have been admiring garbage for thirty years, such as the more bizarre efforts of Jess Franco but I have been struggling to stay (Smile Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confused when the same woman (played by Ewa Aulin , who plays in the movie "Death Laid of Egg" as strange), the only survivor of a coach accident that takes place outside of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück's inheritance. was invited to stay and recover in their home, where Dr. Sturges (Klaus Kinski in a role of thrower) is inclined, the beautiful pride begins with love with both Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrück (which means that the viewers are treated to some short, but welcome, nookie and lesbian lovin 'scenes). "So far, so good," I thought about this point, "I had cocks, incest, some blood and intestines and free female nudity" all the ingredients of a terrible Euro-horror; What follows, however, is a massive Massacessi attempt to combine giallo-type crimes, to launch the ghost and even the elements in "The Black Cat" by Edgar Allan Poe to tell a very bad story, extremely boring and ultimately extremely dull revenge beyond the grave. This film seems to have very few admirers here on IMDb, but given the choice, I would rather watch one of his director's film debaziere later in his career; I think a gigantic, meandering, over-realistic 70-year gothic horror is not my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (exclusive to bricks and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for IMDb.
