Was this film based on reality? I honestly do not hope! We will not see what many armed policemen seem to be, throwing an equal amount of weapons to 2 guys with only the armored torso. This is a wonderful idea; armor target! ... excuse me, but how about those big heads unforgettable or their feet to shout out loud. Or were they invisible tanks to protect them? were they from Crypton? Did I miss something here? This movie started quite decent, but after 20 minutes of shooting it really takes a round at the boringlane. <br /> <br /> That documentary style did not work for me, but that's just something that's nice or not. Extremely incredible things that make it hard to see them until the end. <br /> 3/10 for Fine Editing.
