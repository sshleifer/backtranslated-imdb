What a terrible movie! The idea of ​​robots struggling with each other is cold, but the story is ridiculous, ridiculous real human action, non-existent effects and special effects (which this movie type must depend on) are archaic. I thought it must have been done around the 1980s and 84s and was amazed to see it was since 1990. That's five years after Aliens! OK, a lot of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I think "what do you think?". seems completely incredible. I would not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story, because I still like the idea of ​​giant robots crackling with each other.
