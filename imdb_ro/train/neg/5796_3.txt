I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York, and I was terrified by the sado-masochistic infantile pornography that I witnessed. The story line is hidden under too many graphic sexual scenarios - and none is erotic at least - sick is the more the feeling. The director seemed to go to shock rather than exploring different levels of why these characters are so. See if you can stomach him - I still have retrospectives.
