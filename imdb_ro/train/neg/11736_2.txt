A week before I saw Iowa, I saw the Faculty of Confidential Art, in which a pretentious student makes a movie and can not decide whether he wants to be artistic exploitation or violence. Iowa might be the movie he made. I can see much better movie elements in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artiness, both films had a good character development and coherent story lines. Iowa. This film shoots for an absurd purpose. I have to admit it had a coherence. This movie is bad from start to finish and not particularly bad or better in any part. The actors did everything they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She proves she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why do they have to prove it in this turquoise ball.
