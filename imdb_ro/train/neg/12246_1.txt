*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If someone had to review the movie based on the premise, you might think that you are looking at an animal horror movie. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary films head to an island to film a documentary about shark surfing or blood navigation. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf"). Of course, this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which, if further explored, could have improved the film to a certain extent. However, this is not the case because the blood surfing part of the film is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. The script is absolutely terrible. A good example is when someone is eaten by the crocodile, which is a frequent encounter in this film, no one seems to fuck. The biggest person she made in the movie was just toast the victim in a scene that was supposed to be dizzy, but she just got ridiculous because the dialogue in this movie was of a very dubious nature. Another thing that really irks this movie is that they introduce characters absolutely useless to the movie. They introduce a bunch of pirates that can only be seen to add another 10 minutes to a short film. "The actor can be considered mediocre, it would probably have been more impressive if he had not had such a terrible scenario." There is generally no one who has had a terrible impact on me, every person seemed to be a stray caricature and in this way none of these actors had any impact on me. The crocodile itself is considered to be giant, over 31 feet, and this sense of size is well represented by the obvious fake of a crocodile on which The crocodile's death at the end of the movie is so ridiculously false and controversial that it makes the stomach come back. "With a huge cry, the film's hero announces that he has a plan that turns out to be fallen on a hill and to get the crocodile to roll on a lucky tip at the bottom of the hill. <br /> <br /> In total, I would say that this movie is one that must be seen to believe It was probably a good idea at that time that suffered from a terrible scenario and an overwhelmingly low budget feeling that served to create a really terrible movie.
