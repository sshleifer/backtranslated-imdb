A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets moved into the evil twins of Frosty the Snowman. Then a killing pain continues. An interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it is a kind of cheese. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay for it to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure he has a loyal base somewhere. I'm not in it. Even though I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes I found funny. Such as the Picasso bench and the post-burst scene scene. It was also nice to watch many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-low comedy, but a horror film B with a low budget.
