After reading many of the comments here, I'm surprised that no one has recognized this as a remarkable remake of an episode in the 1960 Twilight Zone called "Mirror Image," with Vera Miles. Rod Serling did much better to create an astonishing 24-minute scare in which Sean Ellis made a terrible time in 88 minutes. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained end, but in a feature film there should be a much more substantial substance, and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, substance and meaning are two things missing from The Broken. Yes, it has a few moments, but these are not enough to justify your time. Some additional comments: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not a movie character has a cell phone! And even if a car accident is the event that leads the story, there is no reference to an insurance company, the person driving the other car or the police who should have made a report. My advice: skip this boring and watch the original!
