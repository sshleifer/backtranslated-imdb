There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They got a crazy story, they did it wrong, they wrote it wrong, they made it wrong. The bad dialogue is very wrong done in a meandering and transient story. As bad as failing as art, he is worse than trade. Who could have been the target market for this. What age group? What interest group? Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. I would have paid to see. I have seen thousands of bad movies, and this is the case with "The Sailors Who Have Fallen Out of Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the most amazing three movies I've ever seen. Everyone who is associated with them should be obliged to make conversations with VanDamme for all eternity. I challenge you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise - how could you do this and make it worse? I can not think of any way.
