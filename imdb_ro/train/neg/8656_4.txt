This is the first review of the non-zombie subgenus, but this movie deserves a review. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it's still a b-obvious film. Dinocroc itself showed great, but I thought the film itself needed a little more weight than in action and violence, because whenever croc is shown or is in a battle scene it does not work very much , except croc is shown and croc or kills drains in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus, and the act was better than the average, and the most surprising thing is that the croc seemed to be meat instead of a curse of cartoons. I liked this film enough to be glad it would be a sequel that is more than what I can say about some movies in general. A total of 3/6 stars and worth a watch.
