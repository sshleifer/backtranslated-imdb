The first one was different and funny. This attempt should never have left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It's a humorless attempt. The movie takes on the current and the old movies to break them. This time jokes seem to be used and overwhelmed. The audience I saw only reacted to Hannibal's dinner scene and otherwise fell asleep.
