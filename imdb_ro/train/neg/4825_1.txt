Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, we were ready for a great horror movie that focused on junkies. What we received was a total stupidity, focusing on junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cooks" that these people have reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them hit me as they are well written or well-done. Basically, the whole movie I just shaken shook my head and marveled at the stupidity of these drug addicts. Do a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more frightening and more compelling than anything you'll find in Cooks.
