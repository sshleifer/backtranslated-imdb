This was a purchased blind DVD used. It totally killed a nice noise I had when I hit him. It's a bubbly comedy, but it's um. sordid. The plot is ZANY! But the characters do things to each other, which are so tiny and disturbed and conveniently, I finally found that it is depressing to look. Perhaps the box makes me expect something more than an uneven, goose-headed movie. (I know, the quotes on the tape and the Oscar nomination are nothing.)
