This is a bad movie. None of the bad guys. This is a bad evil. In fact, it was painful to look. The direction was terrible, with a lot of jumping around and the green and yellow shades used throughout the movie, makes the characters look bad. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed for this celluloid criminal loss. The script was terrible, and the act was like angles on a blackboard. If you have not seen him, no. Do not miss anything and you just miss two hours of your life watching this snoring. I saw early movies and I really enjoyed them because of their flaws. This is just a waste of time.
