I watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I watched. Basically, I think it's a movie about a S & M internet star on Roms CDs that are just as realistic as online flash cartoons. She was killed by someone who is provoking her sister and a team of 2 FBI agents to investigate death. The local homicide division in Big City, USA, is investigating, although much of its work is in the way of CD-ROMs that it claims to be as realistic as "real things". Know. Wow. Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie that has any credits behind him. It's in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of it strikes on the main face for a seemingly absurd reason. I will not even explain the end, because frankly I can not do it myself. But before the final scene, we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute fit of everything that happens in the movie. Honestly, that final stage could have taken place and it would have been the same effect with the cross direction and altogether. <br /> <br /> In total, stay away from this movie. I took it because I like bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could really have used those 80 minutes on something else and I was much more satisfied. Like playing the game with a knife that you repeatedly knocked in your hand. That 80 minutes would be a lot more fun.
