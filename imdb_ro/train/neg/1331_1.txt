The Collusion Course is even worse than the typical "white male corporate corporate corporate" of the week. This movie is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. It's good in the subtle debut movie, The Silverbears, in which he performs a show that consists of his character's requirements. This movie is so bad, Leno's character, a pioneer full of feelings, is less annoying than the character of Morita, a mad monk.
