All right, that's what we did. We should be terrified. The idea was planted. A girl makes her father and takes pictures. Call me the shock-rock genre, but I'm asking for an explicit statement of an act before I can fall for it. But do not expect me to see a porn-soft and be terrified that "her father does" ... I mean, the convention has not become a little abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with rape and molestation 'porn ... Horror is not what your mind can trick you into believing. It's what actually exists in the movie. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes gentle when it becomes a choice of your adventure.
