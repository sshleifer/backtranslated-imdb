During a sleepless night, I walk through the canals and find this embarrassment of a movie. What were they thinking? If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder he did not go anywhere. And why did David Keith play that role? It's pathetic! Anyway, I started the movie almost over, so I did not do much of the plot. But that was the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl ... this scene is directly from comic books - or cheap porn movies. She calls him to the rebirth of her anal mother and kissed her father "Oh, I did not expect my tongue!" Great lines! After that, I had to see how it ended. Of course this bull in hell has a rescue pass, so SWAT is upstairs. And yes ... they surround her! YES YES! The baby blows his brain! AHAHHAHAHAHA! <br /> <br /> You have to see it on the TV. <br /> <br />
