A film with Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, seems a great idea. An independent movie sounds even better. Studios will less control content, allowing actors and writers and director more creativity. But then why is this movie so gentle? Ask your dust. This film even requires bats to be deeply invited to the characters. No one has a fair story, so we never know why the characters behave the way they do it. Explanations of physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you have one left at the end of this movie. I told a friend that I went to see this movie and that I thought it was terrible. Her question: "Could not even Colin Farrell save it?" My reply: "Colin Farrell's ass could not even save him."
