Eh, not a particularly good movie. So, it acts, effects, decent sound, but family and inconvenience. There are three deaths in succession close to the beginning of the movie, which make for a fairly good scene in which something seems to go. Apart from that, there are a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or pursuing after the red herring; more time killing than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity killer, not part of any instrument. The killer also likes to make other people kill and innocent people. Identity is not revealed at the end, the reason is rather thin and we do not care. Probably the movie takes place around Christmas, but this is not a major factor. A scene is lit by Christmas lights, it's about it. The film is rather dark, with a muddy picture for most of the time, at least on the video tape we've been watching. Some of the dialogues have been little lost in some of the opening scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We think we can figure out what's happened, though there's a chance like something else.
