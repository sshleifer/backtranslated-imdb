I watch LOTS of bad movies, LOTS !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday a group of friends and meet and look at garbage from all over the world - NEVER. Turkey's super erotic tournaments, Brazilian vampire films, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Costner films, NEVER (except maybe Raising Helen), but I have never seen a better movie than THEODORE REX. Not. And it's not even bad fun in a kind of Ed Wood quite - just SUCKS. Now, this movie was renowned for Hollywood when it was done because Whoopi pulled out the gloves and made it clear to the press and to anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of carp - she tried to get out of her contract, she shouts, she shouts, but still pours her fat ass in the futuristic uniform of the skinned leathers to see, yikes !!!! And you can see them spinning in her time - she does everything without looking at her room for her agent so she can scream. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions, and the script is so horrible, a third class could do a better job promising cookies.
