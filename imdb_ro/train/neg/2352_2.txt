Crud, as many times as I can - this is the summation of Madhur Bhandarkar's most recent work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just superficial and funny stereotyping. What is the movie about? It's about reporting a clan of people (the so-called types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles alive - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or outside it. There is no press to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and is just a supplement; maybe an interpreter to check who is who and what it is. Do not mix the two. And then there is power play - which will happen in every walk of life. So, what did you tell at the end of everything - nothing - just some raw jokes tied together in another film of another direction.
