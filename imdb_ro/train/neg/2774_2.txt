This is just a bad movie. With what looked like a pretty nice budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost there. With the beautiful heroine almost like Salma Hayek, hero fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in the Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in, for example, Conan ... etc Almost. But ultimately it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Perhaps, in addition to John Rhys-Davies, flying in the duel like those Hero warriors or, before he said, Crouching Tiger ... I'm ashamed of old John. He is, after all, a good actor and he deserves much better. So, as you - so if you have the chance to look at something else.
