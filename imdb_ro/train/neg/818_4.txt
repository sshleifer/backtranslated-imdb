This movie is remarkable for three reasons. First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two Superman series, this low budget feature was made and released in theaters, marking the tracks of George Reeves and Phyllis Coates, initial appearances like Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Some of the opening is re-used in series. Outside of Silby, a 6-mile deep well runs into the "empty Earth," allowing "Mole-Men" to come to the surface. Look at the other holes (those on the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and control) force in preaching and applying tolerance and accepting the difference against a multitude of segregated vigilants. He is not a "mannered" reporter here! Clark Kent, knowledge and self-assertion, captures the control of the situation ("I take care of it"), even helping in a hospital dress by pulling a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is more gentle than Clark to Lois feisty, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he opposes the vigilante as "Nazi troops." <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from Superman's animated Fleisher cartoon into the two live action series that flies in Superman's Adventures has not yet been made.
