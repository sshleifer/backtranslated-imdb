I was not impressed with this movie, especially since I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a 12A-certified film here in the UK. To my disappointment, this movie was filled with embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but it's not good to look with the kids). This movie was sometimes very brutal, sometimes with fart jokes, hit in the inguinal area etc ... and for most of the movie not very funny. The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2 inch leg, gets out of prison and steals a gigantic diamond but is then forced to put it in a handbag. So the rest of the movie sees himself as an abandoned child, enters this woman's house so he can get this diamond back. Until now, I enjoyed most of Wayans Brothers production - but this movie definitely takes the biscuits. A bit of good advice - wait until it comes on TV or cable
