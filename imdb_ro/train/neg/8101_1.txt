It is often said that films can never match the original book. Well, in this case, not only the film is not "as good" as the book, it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milton Kundera's novel that lit the fire than in this "something," which the director probably calls "adaptation." All the beautiful philosophy that asks "Is it better to wear a heavy weight on your shoulders or to deal with the unbearable ease of being?" Is left aside, and instead all filming refers to Daniel Day Lewis' sexual adventures I can say Tomas) with his unhappy wife, mistress and other mistresses Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said that bad directors make bad movies Do not waste your time and money Read the book instead, really worth it.
