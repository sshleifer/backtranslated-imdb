How wonderful. Another movie about America by someone who visited here probably half a dozen, a day, a piece and is considered to be "expert" in the country. Sheesh. I should make a trip to Germany for a week and then go back and make a film about Germany as "the Nazi country" or something like that. Wim IL boy, you should meet Lars von Trier and make ULTIMATE about Americans. Of course we all know that we need a pretentious left-leaning "we are the European" world to make a "real" movie about America. Yes right. For a continent that has not started but two but two world wars, Europe certainly has a lot of opinions about America's "inappropriate" foreign policy. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, boy Wim IL, there are a lot of UC-Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, they are the same people who think George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and that a picture of a soup box is a "pure genius"!
