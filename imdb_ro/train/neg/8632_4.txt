I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he was thinking when he made this film. Normally, if he did a bad movie, I could blame the scriptwriter or director, but in this case it's him. The sukiness of this film is just his fault. This proves that even Heston can not make an interesting story of Shakespeare. I've lost two and a half hours of my life on this postpone event and I will never come back again. This is by far the biggest Heston movie I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you may find this fun movie, but if you do not waste your time, you will regret it in the long run.
