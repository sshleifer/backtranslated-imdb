Wow, this movie was just bloody. In fact, even if I did not pay to see him, I still wanted my money back. The movie has nothing to understand. It's a mish-mash of his sci-fi cliche, which has been made better by the much-skilled film makers. The performances, especially those who drove, were above the top in a less happy Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It's too silent, with no hint of irony or sense of humor. Besides, it does not make sense, nor is the plot, or its lack. The visual effects are good, but they are not enough to go "oh wow, thats cool" and they seem to be thrown into "being cool," rather than being a good plot device. The soundtrack has been another mishmash of things that really never have any kind of mood. Again, it seemed to me that the director was just throwing songs in the movie in the effort to be "cool". Which brings me to the last point. Perhaps if the director were more concerned about plot, story, and dialogue instead of trying to be "cool," he would not have made such a "short-cut" cliche.
