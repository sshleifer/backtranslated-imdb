I crazy read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy one year ago and I said, "It sounds funny, plus Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I paid $ 15.99 plus a fee for that. I took her to a house of friends, and I was both agitated by how stupid it was to write and act. Wood shows abound. All promised "hilarious" and "outstanding" shows never seemed to come. After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing I could never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I almost cried, too, because if this could be considered a "comedy", I do not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours about the horror of this film until it had to be seen only to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year, I followed him because he did not want to look at her alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because as I was watching myself I was just annoyed. I started screaming at the movie and I'm not talking with the movies. Everyone I know has even seen this movie has agreed to the worst situation they have ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not even save this movie. The fact that this movie is not on the 100 list on IMDb is staggering. The fact that his rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
