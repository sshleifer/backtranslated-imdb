We were in such great hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story, such as Arab Nights. Instead, I was disappointed by a movie that failed to keep my attention from the beginning, even if I tried to see it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine had in this movie, but it did not mean too much because the actors did not have much love. For something like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and general joy. OK, so the Son of the Dragon has many fans possible there, but if you are looking for something wow in terms of martial arts and the plot line do not get it. If you only want the kids to settle on an afternoon on Sunday, then maybe this is for you with the 3 ninjas.
