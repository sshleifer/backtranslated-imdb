This movie is "riveted", but in the same way a car accident is riveted. It's hard to look away. Generally, this film is nothing but an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and an unnecessary and biased experiment in that sense. Film makers are manipulative and seem to have no trouble going for the smallest possible denominator. The way the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The steps the filmmakers have forced Ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were naked and lacking any attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the director's posters and to exploit Ted's situation further. The worst part is that film makers stop following Ted after 6 months; and they seem to be totally disrupted by the subject they followed so many months before. If he had taken care, he would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If he really wanted to see what Ted would do, then he would have to let him spend the money without intervention. This movie is at best a Jackass stunt and not a documentary. It's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could actually change a homeless person's life if it were put in his right hands.
