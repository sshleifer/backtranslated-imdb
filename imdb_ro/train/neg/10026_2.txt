I had some expectations for the film because it had an interpretation of the beautiful stars and it is the return of the Akshay duo and Saif. Well, it was a little hesitant to watch the movie because it was made by the same guy who wrote the story of the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt nice because it was put in a beautiful way. Well, the very first scene has let me go. Then, the major drawback of the movie is action sequences. My friends and I laughed with joy when we looked at these strange battles. It was like Akshay against 30 bullies and all and the bullies even have machine guns! Phew ... you have to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. Another thing about the film is the story too predictable. She reminded me of some of the 80s movies. The only thing the movie deserves is sexy Kareena, who looks very well at this. And for this, I agree to a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... you do not see that he thinks it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have some laughter at terrible battle scenes. All these.
