A thematic theme of cinematography from its beginnings is the genre involving seductive women whose cunning and means attract men susceptible not only to their arms but also to difficult circumstances that will usually only lead to the danger of male victims, along with the uncertainty of whether temptations will be forced to take the medicine, and here Susan Lucci plays the siren, though her actress at a telenovela theater is inadequate to make her credible performance. Isabelle (Lucci), the unconcerned wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love business just for fun with yacht seller Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), just a bagatelle for her, but a serious matter of heart for Richard, apparently enchanted by his lover, while taking advantage of his ardor, engaging him in a risky plot that will turn into a schema of criminal intent. When Davis becomes convinced that Isabelle is a victim of the physical abuse being administered by her husband, she desperately tries to free her from what she feels is a marriage trap, so that he can get married, coming to believe that the only clear solution to the situation will be found in a rude essay on hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of Stewart, which is supposedly violent. Following Collins' assault, a pair of police detectives, played by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, are becoming more and more curious about Isabelle's possible involvement in the murder, while the reality flooded with Richard, pay an expensive price in exchange for his maneuver. Lucky and Kasnoff are properly broadcast as a pair of viable conspirators, each giving a reading that makes a set of birds boring rather than charming, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer powerful transformations into a movie that suffers a hackneyed scenario as well as uninvented directions and design elements. Launched on a Fremantle DVD, this highly polished adventure describing a man during seductive sorcery benefits from high visual and sound quality and, although no additional features are provided, the superior quality of production increases the efforts made by Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
