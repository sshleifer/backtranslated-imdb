I was not careful to know that in the early 1990s, Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Added his wonderful film repertoire of technical study programs. Well, this movie must have been the product of the voidictorian class. My friend and I rented the original Boogeyman from 1980 on Netflix and this movie was on the reverse side of the DVD. Do not waste time with this movie. Terrible awful. <br /> <br /> The film adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman had dreams about Boogeyman and his victim from the first movie. Over 50% of this movie is available from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character with bad dreams, while her therapist is knocking on a narrator. These scenes are pushed through a filter so thick that the characters shine. She would have made Angela Lansbury 25 years old. So, let's recap, terrible. Do not watch this movie.
