I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 when I was a high school student. I took a date to see her. I did not "take anything", useless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers's career has not yielded as badly as he would have deserved after making this terrible and unpleasant shit. In fact, unfunny is not quite a severe term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You feel that any laughter that has happened has been beaten out of you before it happens. It is not worthwhile to forget from curiosity or in any sense that it is "so-bad" is "good". Not even the MST3K band could have done that worth it! The fact that Billy Crystal's career has survived this quick suicide attempt is a miracle.
