"The National Lamp Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply painted the worst film ever made, more lean than even "Plan 9 in the outer space". The Lampoon movie is said in three segments, each of them supposed to be a spoof of a conventional film genre, but each of them landing at our feet with a pain of sorrow. There is no rhyme or reason for these exaggerated winemaking and no line of discerning stories. Another commentator on this site wrote that the only good points about the movie are nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry make a bit of meat, and he's very nice too. But directors do not seem to realize that T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing of this. Perhaps the worst of the three segments is the last with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, cheerful policeman, linked to a cynical veteran played by Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who are still looking at this honest exercise are in love with the thought that we are about to see a redeeming story about how the young, idealist cop brings a clever change to addressing the old police work. But no such luck. As I said, this movie has no redeeming values. It is bad until the end of the fading - which, perversely, stretches more than it should last on the screen. Apparently, movie makers knew they had a bad thing and wanted to make it less and less.
