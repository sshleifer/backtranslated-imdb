From everything I read about the movie, I was delighted to support a movie with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessional. Especially writing! Without writing well a movie has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to put aside the title to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I waited for the adolescent / young adult's story to unfold but never did. Like someone who went through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would have been NOT comfort for me when I went through the emotional disturbances that divorce can bring into your life as a Christian!
