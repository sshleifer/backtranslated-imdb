The five very good Westerns, which Mann did, are unmatched as a Hollywood ensemble. Even John Ford has never done so many with so much quality. The curious thing about them is how uneven they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two-and-a-half of any of them. Or at least two. Their true hero, with Mann and Stewart, is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant red river. Chase wrote the distant country, the river's inclination, and perhaps others. But none of them is as finite as my Clementine, but then very few films, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has huge gaps, or it's six, let's see. Bend, Far, West Man, Furies, Winchester 73, and Six, Six, Naked Spur. Each of them has a magnificent scene, after a magnificent scene with quite sharp shocks. However, Red River, which is still the only largest ever made ever. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the Land Without has huge and huge holes. It's mawkish, and it really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are blocking the horns. The rest is quite pedestrian, except for the usual Mann's room. Mann's room is a one-person course in cinema. It's about an eye as good as anybody else who's got a movie strip on the move. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The remote country has an amazing moment. And, as usual, comes from Stewart. No one in the history of cinema has ever received a physical punishment with the authority of that man. It's absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester, and Laramie Man: in Bend he was beaten and clinging to a thread so credible and so harsh, hatred, looks like somebody moved from Dachau, it's shot from a cork with such violence, it seems so convincing that you have lost yourself and, of course, when dragged through the fire in man, you find yourself looking for signs of burning. What actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester, when he is beaten early in the hotel room, as well as anyone who ever did. <br /> <br /> But this was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper's fight with Jack Lord in the Man of the West. As painful as any battle scenes ever recorded. Cooper, while not as convincing as Stewart, yet is equally in search of exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, no one, but no one, but no one has ever shown the human being in the extreme, as well as Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> See every Western you've ever done. These are his real monuments, even if they are all scetchy. But also what. When he rocks with his big scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And the six vestiges as a whole are the best done by anyone, the period. Thank you, Anthony.
