In a word: This is a romantic cookie-cut comedy that really WANTS and TRIES is a bit more. He wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. She wants to be profound and human. Has interesting photos of camera, lighting, music, editing, all giving him the feeling of an important movie. Dialogue is smart - sometimes. There are some moments of "laughing". But here's what it's like to be finally something more than a late night cable cable, during the flight, a killer of time: 1. David Schwimmer - by how many or can dog dog Joe sad in space, with his jaw opening before he starts becoming annoying? Perhaps a little slum would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - it's very flat here and not just in the chest. Her role should be this lively, cute and caring girl who continues to face mistakes, is very confusing as a result, and that's why a sad sacrifice like Schwimmer has a chance with her. But Gwenneth plays it very dull. Combine this with the slumber puppy puppy (above) and you have very little chemistry to care for. (I kept the image of someone else in this role - for example, Kate Hudson.) <Br /> <br /> 3. Scenario and plot - things that happen only basically do not sound true; all the problems are finally wrapped in a clean and clean arch that seems to have breathed a whistle and the writers of the scriptures only said, "Oops, time to wrap it, to catch a train." So they pulled out the Hollywood book, checked all the boxes and went home.
