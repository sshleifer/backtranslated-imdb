In a way, a woman working with a scientist puts metal balls in the mouths of people who are supposed to change their personality, but actually turns them into killers, such as zombie killers. "Guinea pigs" for the experiment are expensive-clad, young nubs in desperate need of lesson to act. This movie is terrible, atrocious and amazingly bad. It has little to no logic in the script. You'll really have problems with what's going on. It does not have any special effects. The computer screen, which is supposed to represent a huge scientific advance, shows nothing but an old Atari screen. And what's worse is that there is also a hair-hunted doll (shown as a lone child at the summer camp), called George, who is a personal servant / confidant for Jessica (the lead actress). Throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic and sophisticated utopias of this doll. But wait ... you will also get a lot of softcore, unerotic scenes, barely nude with girls with men. While a very annoying soundtrack plays in the background as a sort of spiritual discovery has taken place. None of the actors is good. There are different degrees of harm. Gore and horror are unnecessarily filmed. The movie really looks like a teenager put it together. Without a coincidence, Henry Sala, the director by name, but not the trade, did not make another film. I was almost bored in a coma looking at this silly, silly! And how does it end? What happened? If you know, leave me in secret, because I can not figure out for my life. All I know is that I wasted my time watching these garbage, which made my weekend a real nightmare of boredom!
