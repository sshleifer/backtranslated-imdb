I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote "A Double Life" and the "Born of Yesterday" amusing and co-wrote such excellent scenes as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then with the writer and / or directed by such a boring, sad as "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and that. The movie is trying, but the script is so tired and enchanted that even the efforts of the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are always defeated. The script sinks to an extremely offensive level where Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. An ugly sequence, but unfortunately one that could easily play in a movie today. The "ethnic" jokes are now verboten, but "beg" jokes are still "good, clean, fun in the family".
