This movie has a wonderful brunette named Danielle Petty. It has veritable green eyes and is in the first scenes and the last scene. It is the only thing about this film that is not repellent. Perhaps she does not have a future as an actress, because this type of movie is a kind of offensive disaster that kills her career. The film itself has nothing to recommend. It's not a good horror movie or a good or bad journalist made good from a distance. There is no apparent aptitude in her production. It's like a bad student movie. The terrible elements of the story do not hurt you, it's so badly made that makes you feel bad. I would give this movie star ZERO if I could.
