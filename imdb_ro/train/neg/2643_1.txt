This, for lack of a better term, the film is bad. Where do I start? ... Cinemaphotography - It was perhaps the worst thing I've seen this year. It looks like the camera was thrown from the camera to the camera. Maybe they only had one room. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball player. There are a bunch of scenes, by chance, thrown away without any continuity. When they did the "split screen" it was absurd. Everything was cut flat, it was ridiculous. The color tones were very far away. These people must learn how to balance a room. This film is poorly accomplished and poorly accomplished. The land - You have to joke. If I were an SS agent, I would sue the manufacturers. they looked like Marks brothers with radios and weapons. Sutherland was in "24" mode - I can see this for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less and showing much more. As a bimbo action it was not too much. I could not see a real plot, other than Douglas kissing the wife of the presidents. I never said why the mercenaries are trying to kill the press. I just do not see that the President of the United States leads the life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a labyrinth. p-to-e-s-s. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is proof. I like the "big screen". Since I was a child. Many more movies like this and I will give up. What does Hollywood do, did so many chick movies, watch how to make a real movie? If I had a theater, I would start broadcasting the old movies. The one with real actors, good story lines - and good cinema. This movie is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. I'm evaluating this "movie" to zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at his age, but he's too much to take him to.
