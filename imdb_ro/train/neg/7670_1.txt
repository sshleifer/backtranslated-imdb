Well, where can I start my story? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends who knew nothing more than the actors in it and that it should have been a horror movie. Well, I realized that in the first 20 minutes, a bad decision I made to see her watching this movie. The plot was stupid, just like the scenario. The lines were horrible to the point where people in the audience were hysterically laughing. The distribution could not have been plastic. Even some of the scenes seemed as if they had to be done much faster ... as if dragged without any special reason. Very poor editing. Everything in this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
