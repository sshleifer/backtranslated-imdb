Much of the scenes should be cut. There are a lot of scenes that should have been interrupted. For example, the scene where hunters mention "I have spiders on my dick", "I like the dick," playing in the mud scene or a bar scene where a professional dinoccer hunts a main job is a snake charmer. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> How about other terrible scenes of inconsistency with a woman, Diane who wants to lose her virginity to a friend who goes as if she were wearing three-dimensional panties for women. While making love, they did not realize they were doing it next to the boy who would run away soon and lose his head? Why did they in a living room? I mean his head was overturned. How about the beach scene that reminds a lot about Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene at Grant Lake. All this strange scene could easily be renamed and paid as a comedy. Here in my local city, cineplex theaters have been published for Dinocroc for months and I'm glad I did not watch because I later learned that it was only displayed for 1-2 days before being canceled. The movie was HERE bad. I guess Dinocroc was not a good movie watching the preview. He has the Dinocroc foot that looks like a baby wearing green pajamas and clap slippers and travels up and down like a 2 year old. It could easily go like Geniuses for kids. If some film students want to learn what not to do is a true classic rubbish. Like Diane's boyfriend, who is going as if he had an advanced syphilis case, he makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk before drinking beer. When does this happen, who cares about Dinocroc? The pantie man looked much more interesting than Dinocroc's entire film. His acting was so bad, he made a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comedy talent in a horror sci-fi movie. Perhaps the worst casting in Hollywood history.
