We could not give this movie a negative rating or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some disturbing slight elements that lean towards psychology that was something the film could have focused a little. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a night story narrator who goes through personal troubles: his lover is moving away, and Gabriel has what seems to be a storyteller. One day she receives and reads a story written by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells about his life and the abuse he has suffered from his parents. She lives with her adopted mother and social assistant Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland does not even exist. I will not go into detail because I do not want to destroy the movie, but I'll tell you this: it's quite predictable. A fascinating atmosphere to tell a story and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette, whom I thought was the key character of the movie. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Her ability to touch the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very strange and I hope to see her by winning an Oscar (hell, I think it could nudge the best supporting actress for it if the script would be a bit better ). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but one predictable about it. If you are curious to know the end of the movie and twist, then you see the movie otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called "Hide and seek".
