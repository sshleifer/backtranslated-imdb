can ask why? the characters snore, scream and chew the landscape for no perceptible reason, except for someone who wanted to make a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is the right one, is forgotten in the role of the spouse / foreign-husband / loving-father-of-cute-blond. the story seems to have been cut and stuck on the scenes thrown by adventure films over the past three years. the lack of charisma of ellen pompeo is a black hole that seems to suck the energy from every scene they are in. her true acting is displayed when she pulls her blouse while the movies take care of a scene of chase to another. Unfortunately, the direction rarely goes bad enough to be a camp or a parody. is precisely the clich√©, familiar in all respects. the director threw his own daughter as an early bracelet, probably because no respectable agent would have allowed a client to destroy a career, being in such a limp, contrived and uninteresting film. the only rape here is stealing the investor's money and the viewer's time.
