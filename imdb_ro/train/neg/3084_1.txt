this is the result. A piece of garbage film that does not even deserve to be classified as a movie is just a bunch of stuff on a film coil, which makes no sense. Well, back to the actors who from getting go seems to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a small amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's a great horror anyway, without being a movie. There are a lot of horrible actors in "Hobgoblins," but the worse is the main guy that Richard calls, which is too much too bad for a wicked root. Well, when you throw a bunch of friends and try to make the movie scary, at a lower budget than shocking, no less, that's gonna happen. At least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a terrible movie that deserves everything it does. 9 for the MST version.
