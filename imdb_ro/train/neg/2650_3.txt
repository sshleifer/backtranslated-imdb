While I was subjected to this telemedicine mediocrity, I wondered why? Why was Dianne Keaton agreeing to this garbage? The film uses meaningless and controversial plot lines to deliver garbage to the homes of thousands of people. The film has a political agenda at a new level. The film was meaningless and all credit was lost due to excessive use of the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this film worthwhile, but in the end he must remember the old age you can not polish. I hope you did not waste your New Year's Day looking at another mind made for the TV movie. Now I know why the networks started broadcasting the series on the night of Sunday, to get rid of the garbage!
