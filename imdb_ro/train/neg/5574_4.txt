"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea of ​​pathetic subjects such as pseudo-patriotism can be destroyed. Here, future travelers attempt to destroy Japan by replacing the Godzilla local hero with the puppy monster, the three-headed gold dragon King Guideorah. They do not succeed and eventually Godzilla fight Ghidorah. The battles between the two monsters are very cold, but the plot of the film is full of holes and everything about "Japan is great" is really bad. The creators of this film have not even threatened Japanese enemies by making stupid blond boys who are easily neglected by the intelligent Japanese. The best thing is that, eventually, Godzilla and King Ghidorah have almost destroyed both Japan and ridiculous enemies in a spectacular fight (actually two). But until this royal battle, the movie was really dull and pathetic.
