Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And, I like B-rated movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even liked bad writings, fertile scenarios, wooden lines, unlikely situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on so many levels. For all the reasons listed above and many others. This includes the absurd and blatant use of feminine genital images. And many hints on male genital organs, in a very Freudian way. I am convinced that this is simply from inexperience. Unlike some attempts to do something really different. That is, any film that takes years to film, can not keep up with the congruence and concentration demanded by the modern audience. We hoped the whole movie would have been just a dream or hallucination by the main character. However, unfortunately, it had to happen the way we saw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only goodness I can express is that the picture at the end was astounding. If it had been used at first, in the end, it could have allowed the movie to take off where 2001 ended ... For the worse they did not try that in return. I just do not understand what was so important with this movie that it had to be done. Was it the plot? It certainly could not be. Were the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was the dialogue? Obviously, no. The music? Perhaps, but perhaps more, the unrelated ego of directors must be comforted. <br /> <br /> The much better efforts have died on the floor of the cutting room.
