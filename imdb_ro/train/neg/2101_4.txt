Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultivated journalist. Cinematography was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a vast world movie dictionary) and was thus forced to wear a room at least once in his life. However, the films he has left have received hot reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996), despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, was very caricature in character description, "Affaire De Goût" (2000) was a Slick adventure even if Bernard Giraudeau performed a perverse interpretation, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another deterrent and "a Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is as overwhelming as its predecessors. His comic potential is exploited in a fake manner. However, the idea of ​​starting allows you to predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. A couple owned by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends, moved into a lascivious house. In order to play with their guests, they claim to share with each other. And things do not go the way we planned, because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to think about the validity of their couple. Despite the lush landscapes and promising material available, Rapp's undefined direction fails to give life to this game with unexpected consequences. Complot follows a well-worn model with characters that have well-known features and masks that are revealed about who they really are. The verbal comic effects or the situation often fall down. A bad editing fades away the movie with this bad habit from Rapp to suddenly cut off many sequences. Even the actor's sincere contribution to the adventure is questionable. They seem to be bored and recite their texts rather than live, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpedo. It is regrettable to say that Bernard Rapp's films have never been able to achieve his intentions as "a Petit Jeu sans Conséquence".
