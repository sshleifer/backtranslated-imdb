I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great like all Greenaways productions. However, it was his usual blend of "art" sex and pretentious carp. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I became tired of it very quickly. It's definitely not for everyone. The usual McGregor man obviously took part in credibility, but he should not have to waste his time. I hate to give somebody to Pseud's corner, but please ..... !!! Besides, it's very visually attractive and I enjoyed music, but I have not been able to see it all the way, and I can not say that for many movies. I usually look at everything, but this is unbearable!
