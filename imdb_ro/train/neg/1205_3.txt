What is this? A Canadian film produced by the zombies I never heard of. A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows an extended flashback that shows how the guy got there. Practically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday, 13, and died because of his stupid scandal. Cut back into the morgue where our dead body returns to life and kills the mortician and the owner (who opens his eyes). The latest WTF? shot the owner of the funeral home in a straight jacket and screaming, "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, he has glasses back. Running in a minute of 58 minutes is certainly a strange thing in zombie cinema. He feels a lot more, but he puts me in some sort of trance where I can not stop. The movie also has one of the "if you see this picture, turn your screen off" gags. Is it the image of an old man who becomes ill in a theater (prophetically?) And when it appears (only twice) the blood starts to flow. The scenes are pretty bad for the time. There is a great blunder in which a zombie throws the right hand of a girl with a shovel, but - when he pulls his fake hand in the frame to tip over - is a left hand.
