Basically, Caprica is the story of Cylon origin. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many POV characters that the story shoots. The plan moves at glacial speeds, dissipating the tension it could have. In any given episode, little or nothing happens. Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only work prototype is driven by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by one-man soldiers (STO), an underground monoteist extremist group. Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (Battlestar Galactica's father Adama's father) is struggling to keep his family together while looking for the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in bombardment) in a Capricorn virtual version of Machiavelli (which looks like strong with the 1930s in Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to vapid writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many home stories. We already know how it ends (that is, the Cilanes develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
