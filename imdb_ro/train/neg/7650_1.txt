I know I'm in the minority, but ... Uwe Boll is just as talented as a frog. Not even a madman; just a frog. He recalled about one hundred other hackers without talent, throwing a useless crap-fest after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's a crap-fest. Slater's talent is used only minimally, which leads to the belief of other minds (such as his failed relationship). Reid behaves as if he had forgotten his acting lessons, was hit hard and forgot to forget his acting lesson or had one of the worst directors in the history of the film. I will vote on the third choice, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done one thing from which I deduced even the slightest pleasure. Honestly, I am pleased to have done this. I was preoccupied with Bloodrayne who competed with "Underworld: Evolution" for selling tickets. Now, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I do not mean Nothing, worry. It misses a 1.0 / 10 rating for this messy, convoluted carp-fest from ... <br /> Fiend :.
