A young basketball professor of genetics makes research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He was pressured to end his research because he did not publish, so the university has problems in justifying its funding (I think). He makes a test injection on a monkey who dies quickly. Then try it alone. He starts a relationship with the mother of an extremely annoying little boy; it is she who asked for research results. Initially, he does not seem to have effects from injection, except for new powers. Then he realizes he has a memory loss and begins to recall what happened. In addition, it starts to appear very unhealthy. Because the film is called metamorphosis, it eventually turns into something else. You will not believe your eyes - neither what has turned into it, nor the absolutely crocodile costume the actor carries to describe what has turned into him. Incredibly, there is an extra change in the store - the end of the movie is indeed, really absurd. The only thing this movie has for him is that Laura Gemser is in it, but he has a very small part. I once saw a video box for it, with a sculptured plastic shape attached to the box. Perhaps it might even have some electronics in it at some point, perhaps the eyes that light up (the main character's eyes become occasionally green in the movie). The copy I was looking at had a box showing only tear marks that had stuck the plastic glue that had been removed. The novelty case, if it had it, would have been the only reason I'd kept this movie; I can handle it.
