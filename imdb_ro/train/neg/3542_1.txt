After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It looks like this movie is like Marmite and divided the audience. I have to say that while I agree that movies do not make sense to be nice (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) you still have to engage with the characters. Now, while I was totally absorbed by the murderous Lesbian business in Lynch's opposite, I must say that I could not betray Mr. Green or the other cartoon gangsters who lived in this world of the day. <br /> <br /> Also, while so many people seem to try and say that you were not happy because you did not receive it, I would have to disagree - I was glad because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end and to constantly listen to those quotes again and again did not help. Call him smart if you want - I think it's repeated. However, my main reason for writing is to ask all other commentators a question - there were no final credits when printing the movie I saw. Just music over black. Did I look at a pattern or is it a proof of GR's pretentibility? Or, everyone involved in the movie watched the rough cut and removed their names ???
