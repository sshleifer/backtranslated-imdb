This DVD seems to be targeted by someone who will put it and play it in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos from Grand Canyon, which is based on different melodies of Tangerine Dream music. Unfortunately, TD music is boring, and the transfer to DVD seems rather unclear and dim. Very expensive a DVD for what it is.
