As a lesbian, I'm always looking for gay and lesbian movies. However, with this kind of nonsense there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. I've waited all the time for something to happen - anything - a story to develop or just for her to make some sense. It has not happened. There were only meaningless scenes, nothing to do with anything. The film failed to convey any story or depth to the character. After an hour or more of this nonsense, I turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. 1 star - and not even worth it.
