this film has been shrouded in scandal for so long that it has become a very sought after item ... indignation, mystery, etc. had everything to be a great piece of filming, but eventually fails to any extent. is a horrible comedy of horror, a terrible horror movie, an erotic film blade. The 2-disc DVD includes a superb brochure of photos, interviews, bestiality essays, etc., as well as a thorough interview with the director more than pretentious. for those who have heard about it but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until someone will see the movie. Disc 1 contains the edited movie, translated badly into English but with good visual quality. disc 2 contains cutting the director, in a terrible transfer, in French. What can I say about the real beast? a Kermit hand puppet would have been more effective and more shocking.
