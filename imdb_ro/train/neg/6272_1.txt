This is a selection of dialogue, offered by the bad, sweet assistant, from a famous scientist for her maids, just before luring three incredibly poor faces to college in a mansion for behavioral modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drank and danced for 80-year-old rock songs. A biker penguin has sex with a cycling slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd, then tries to violate the virginal daughter of researcher Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who in turn is in cohort with the assistant! Back home, sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men at the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into the mouths of the victims and turns them into killer zombies, murderers! If this is not enough to have fun, there is a hilarious theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), roller skating, big daughters of daisies and a psychic hand puppet (!?) That warns "DANGEROUS DANGER!" just like the LOST IN SPACE robot, and recommend hitchhiking as one of the best ways to raise men! This movie in Florida is so great that many visions are recommended to get it all. And is not that NYPD Blue Detective Jill Kirkendall became CNN reporter Andrea Thompson as one of the nude bimboos? Sure it is! Assuming this was started in 1982 and a new record was added later for the release of the video in 1985. Score: 1 out of 10 (and I mean in a good way!)
