The word "first" in the title has a more terrible meaning for viewers of this film than for crime victims. At least they do not have to stay around and watch this endless film come to his own death. The first should refer to: the first draft of the scenario; The first is used in each show in the final movie; Edit 1 post-production; etcetera, etcetera. The film is not too bad, it's just that everything about the film is so much like the third stage, from the Gothic scenario to the wooden performances. And while you suffer through this movie downstairs together with the 2-hour mark you want to get out of your misery. It is obvious that it should have been written in less than two hours at 160 minutes. Entry into blade scenario and action do not serve minimal purposes. Even equally terrible, Lake Placid, at least Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda, based on a very poor screenplay, were pretty nuanced to make you laugh at the film. On the first day of dying, one ends up grieving only for the lost time waiting to see what happens after the opening stage of preparing the suicide of the female leader. The edition is so bad that it is never introduced to one of the main characters, which I think (I did not say at all) is a DA Appears in a single scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene in which he was presented to the spectator was abandoned on the pub floor. And nobody realized that a character coming from nowhere was an unusual movie. In a word, do not waste time with this. My wife and I would not want to. But at least we have created our own diversions by commenting on various places in the movie, such as the Mystery Theater of Sciences. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ..." !!!!
