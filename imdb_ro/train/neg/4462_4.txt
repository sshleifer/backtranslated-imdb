The "true" story of three daughters who come into the wilderness of Connecticut and end up being hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is a kind of movie that would have played in the American island's drives thirty years ago to enjoy mixed recognition. There is nothing particularly out of the movie that works with its low budget to mixed results. The movie is being watched, but it is not scary at all (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget once you're done with that. The winnings are that you will never think of seeing it unless you have handed it to someone and told them: "look here," what happened to me. If you get a copy, you'll give it back, the movie is not worth the effort to see it, even if it's being watched.
