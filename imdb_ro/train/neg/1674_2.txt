The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this film makes no justice for him. The tower was pretty good and was shot beautifully - but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (the fast, too bad writing was done without any effect ...). I expected Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a trader), the characters were identified exclusively by the use of coca-cola on the screen (and almost everything left for Boogie Nights to develop the character) and no character personified to attracts the viewer into the story. A very forgotten movie.
