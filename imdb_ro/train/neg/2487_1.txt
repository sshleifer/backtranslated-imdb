Take "Rambo," blend in some "Miami Vice," split the budget by 80%, and you have something that some ten-year-olds could have come if they had a pretty big yard and too much access to the "Penthouse." Cop and former Commander McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as thin as it would come) is recruited to recover an American supertank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank were hard Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and former love of McBain Devon (Fluegel), commanding officer and now meat for depraved terrorists / spies / drug traders, who have no sense of decency, bla, bla, bla. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and not too much sex. The joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. It seems that the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven", nor did he even think of giving McBain even a pretense of intelligence. Even for a budget shareholder, production figures are weak, with distant photos during the dialogue and very little movement. The main engine, the tank, is stupid enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who could have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much greater role in "Crime Story" than Julia!) You have to go from simpering to scared to kick-kick & back again for a moment. Jones, who has been in a series of stunning movies, is struggling far from here. Both he and Busey were probably just for some simple money and a few laughs. Look for the talented actor, the future character Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical, threatening part. Very boring even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still quite noisy to play when you leave your home, but you want people to think that someone is home.
