The Japanese sense of pacing, editing, and musical score must be different from American tastes, but it certainly could have been a little more post-production. Someone in Hollywood has to redo this movie and I think it would be a great success. The story is exciting and creepy. There is something about the city's borders, police, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious salt water, which is enough to be captivating. However, this story has to make only a little sense and can be about 40 minutes shorter. I have to say that the "sixth sense" effect was in full force in this film, and that was obvious from the start. Nowadays, only the dead Japanese film lovers should be afraid to see this movie so boring.
