SPOILS Too many times, Shakespeare's adaptations from Hollywood have cinema entertainment. The handsome guys are well-behaved and faithful to the text. The films that include Branagh's "Henry V" and "Much Ado About Nothing" in 1993 are the powerful pieces of work. Watching "Loss of love labor" is such a disappointment for expecting to be so despised that it is scattered. Unfortunately "Lost work of love" is terrible! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends left the drink and women for three years to focus on their studies. Plans begin to collapse, though the enigmatic princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon love is in the air, and philosophy is out of the mind of the prince. From the beginning, you realize that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. Cleric relocated to a 1930s musical by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it has been sacrificed for a terrible musical taste. Classics, such as "The way you look tonight," "Let's face the music and dance," "I'm in Heaven" are destroyed by weak songs and I feel strongly that they do not belong here. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Ken Branagh and friends might enjoy doing this movie, but they offer us a stomach rotation collection of roles. The top eight actors (four men and four women) are just as terrible on their behalf is a huge improvement over timothy Spall really terrible. In fact, only one individual leaves the movie worthy of any praise and that's Nathan Lane, constantly magnificent. Lane has proven over the years to be a comedy genius, and in this feature once again adds a humor to the Costard jester. There is nothing else to say in reality. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves a slight praise for Branagh's initial take on an old story. Unfortunately, however, the positives end there. Performed, performed, sung and built, "Love's Labor's Lost" is probably the slightest adaptation of Shakespeare in the last forty years. It should be avoided as a plague and should never have been done. A poor, disappointing choice by Branagh and here he hopes the next effort is better.
