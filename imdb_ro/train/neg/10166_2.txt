If he wanted to be fair, he would have had to choose some locals from Frisco and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in my entire life in the SF and the people here do not speak or act like the actors did. Everything was dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Gulf of JT was Bigga Figga, with his little cameo rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the movie that really dressed like the cats here (that is, the Warriors' shirt). I have never noticed someone wearing any Giants or 9ers; Instead, he puts them in t-shirts made in the shape of SF or Oakland, which are not even sold here. HP has no bowling alleys, black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear headgear or bracelets in Africa or the Olympic team in China, and no Chinese gangster wears Yao Ming's shirt and tries to sound black while shooting circles. In addition, while there is a significant yuppie community that invaded the mission, all that was shown was a white guy and a self-proclaimed "100% Boriqua West Coast". This is not New York! Puerto Ricans here are few and far, and the Latins of the Mission are very, very different from the UN that was presented here, which was undoubtedly from NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in town. An accurate picture would show the drama between HP sets in their own hood, as well as Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. This movie could have been much better if Lee had done a little more homework and had a better story to work with.
