Steven Seagal seems to have been sleepwalked through a terrible shot almost entirely to hide a total lack of budget and resources. To select technical defects - silver F / A-18 and F-14 would take from a carrier for an air blow and miraculously will camouflage the F-16 for the real blow - would give this film more credibility than worth it. Suffice it to say that the most exciting thing in the movie is fading credit cards and then disappear into a lightning wiper that is probably available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all the creativity into his own credit, Michael Keusch is in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
