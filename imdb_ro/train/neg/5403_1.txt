I gave this movie a single star just because it was impossible to give it less. Scientists have developed a formula to replicate any organism. In their lab (a depot deployed in LA), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies frown to steal the formula, and the rest of the film is an endless pursuit of the foot. Of course, T-Rex (rubber puppet) becomes free and begins to destroy voices. It has an amazing capacity to sneak within two or three feet of someone without observing them and then biting his head off his head. A member of the scene escapes into a police car and spends the rest of the movie without purpose through the city. He has a superior mental ability that he can not even operate the radio. She never makes any attempt to drive to a station or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost. T-Rex is raging throughout the city, there are battles with guns and light buildings (cardboard mock-ups) but one police car, the army, or no one else appears. Such an activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles. We can only hope that there is no continuation planned.
