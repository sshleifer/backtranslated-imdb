Tom listens to one of the old radio shows, something that kids from the 1950s to today would watch on television. However, they did not make television when this cartoon was made, so people received entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally shaking in boots listening to a story about the "ghost". In fact, he literally does what the narrator says, such as "the hair standing in the end, the ice cold flowing on the spine, the heart throbbing in his throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, was looking at Tom and laughing at the bottom of the scared cats. <br /> <br /> Then we get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194 cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom without any reason but sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for a problem, it's one thing, but when he changes his own business and Jerry is physically abused (and in this case, mentally), I have a difficult spin on the little guy. <br /> <These early efforts of T & M were also one minute longer than everything that followed. Sometimes a minute has a difference. She did it here because it has been dragged for a while. It could have been cut at five minutes without missing anything, because the sketches went too long. That's right for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are much faster.
