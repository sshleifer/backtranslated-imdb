Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably just be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (who have pills for this now!) It is probably the weakest element of this show. It is really the tired formula of the Highlander series - the immortal hero encounters another immortal with flashbacks the last time they met, but there is a conflict and there is a sword fight at the end of which you have a sequence of cheap special effects . <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Practically your typical hero with the typical story "Sex Tension". (Seriously, why do you think about Hollywood genres that sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a Canadian / French joint production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York and the other half is in Paris ... as Highlander did.
