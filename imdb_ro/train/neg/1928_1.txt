As Christmas Grinch Stole was a wonderful Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with people, the cartoon was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a bit strange for Jim Carrey to be Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedy actor, but he's like Grinch? It just did not make any sense to me. His performances were a bit overhead and ridiculously unintentional at times. Not to mention, some of the added dialogue was a little bit childish and not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou - which ended and was not necessary. They actually destroyed the story, the period. Everyone in Whoville is preparing for the best Christmas season, but if everything is meant to go perfect. But Cindy Lou - Who is curious and worried about Grinch who lives above them and that he will not get as good a Christmas as the other. He hits her and decides she does not want Christmas this year and that she really should steal Christmas together to show who her Christmas version is. But soon he realizes that who can know that it is more than what is the materialized version of Christmas. How did not need Christmas Grinch Stole and was a little overhead. I really recommend you stick to the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The formation and presentation of the entire movie was just a little more than done, not to mention that the way Grinch Stole Christmas! was rather meant to be like a cartoon than a version with Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is playing every Christmas.
