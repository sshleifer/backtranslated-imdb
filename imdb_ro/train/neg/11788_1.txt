This was one of the worst movies EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I laughed through the WHOLE movie! The land was SO; especially the end. This movie turns from a disaster at the end of the world to save the eel! I mean! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK bouquets for eel! And it was a horrible kiss scene in the middle of two main characters who were divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mom, my sister, and I could not finish it, and when I finished it it was about a year later! The second time I watched her and I finished it this time, I made comments like MST3K throughout the movie. Summary: Just watch this if you are a movie basher! Make funny comments, watch this for a laughing sleep and I refer to the huge WAR. Also watch for scorn. Metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and a sock puppet!
