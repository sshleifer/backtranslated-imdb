It might be thought that a movie about a young person who will be doing his thriving homosexuality would be nothing but boring. Think it over. This production should be bottled and sold as a remedy for insomnia, as it is approximately ten times stronger than any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * considered * making a movie, but he became lazy and instead decided to run a series of random (and random) images and go on stage, cast a few real scenes, that good lighting is not important in the filming process and wraps it under the auspices of an "arthouse" movie. This is a kind of frightening product that relieves a lot of traditional filmmakers to poo-poo indie film movement and that allows the general public to more easily embrace indie films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films that cover this topic, you would be better off giving yourself some of the great short films available on the Logo website or renting Get Real. Better, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long piece.
