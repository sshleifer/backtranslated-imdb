Horrible, horrible, horrible not losing money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget for Canadian TV. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there were a lot more there. This movie is not worth the time to put it in a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The act was horrible, there was absolutely no flow, I saw the movie made for the TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better (compared to it). in producing this film, but if we were to educate or tell a story about the BTK killer they lost for a mile, it seemed to be more of an infomercial about animal rights.
