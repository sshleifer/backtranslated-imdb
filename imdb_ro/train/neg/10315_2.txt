I can not believe people thought that this garbage was fun. Changing the humorous attempts between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is something about Mary" leaves no reason to stay to the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very cute, but that will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller is trying hard to work in the plot and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser. There has never been one of the credible scenes. The photos were wrong and framed. The Farreley brothers should be far from making movies at any cost. I checked the IMDB to see what works, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus is since I smiled. It does not mean I'm immune to humor or just in my opinion. And my wife hates her. The next day I saw "Time of Rush" and we laughed at us. This film just embarrassed.
