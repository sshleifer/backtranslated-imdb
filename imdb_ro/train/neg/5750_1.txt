in fact, it was quite funny ... in a "god, how the hell did this movie be done" kind of way. if you have fun in the movies ... that they do ... let go of it and watch ... but if you think "is a good movie?" eff off. This movie has been sampled from the beginning of the scene with the worst act I've ever seen in any movie ... they usually get five minutes before you realize that "this movie could suck." but no, you know from the bat. this movie talks about Edgar Allen poe ... never tried to explain it to people who have not memorized the poe's life story ... so I do not know if something of what was said is actually. This movie is about a writer "ethan poe" surrounded by his cousin "ann" .... are both descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they? apparently, people give what their ancestors did. this type of ethane poe is basically ethane "usher", which should be descendants of the story "usher's house" written by edgar allen poe. Ann's brother sometimes appears to try to rape him ... The year is also being watched, at some point in the film, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... are like behind her and he does not realize it). the characters that are killed over time are all over to try to save the day ... but I can not. at the end of the year, Ann trains herself while trying to kill her best friend. of course, before he shoots him, he must shout "never!" this movie should never be seen!
