What a clear and lacking brilliance of the classic novel. I want people not to talk to the classics when they have no idea about the original intention or point. This version is no different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse, though the cast Juliette brioche like Kathy must be the worst EVER casting decision ... anyway back to this version. Its purpose is to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and a musical style. Succes in both but the high art is thread. A view for a day full of rain may ... Direction was medium and the abyss edition. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a big change like Hindley and is, in fact, one of Britain's lost talents. The Heath side was played with great charm and faith, and I think pouring is the strongest point in this project. Although a more talented director would better use the facilities he had. It is clear that he was a director for employment and did not instill the project with the passion he deserves.
