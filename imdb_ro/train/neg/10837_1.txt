I can not tell you how angry I was after seeing this movie. Characters are not even interesting, and intrigue does not exist. So, after you wait to see how the lives of these characters have affected, hoping the last two and a half hours have led to a significant end, what do we get? A frog of frogs. Now, yes, I understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the fundamental theme, but first of all, absolutely no resolution was presented and, secondly, it would have been lost for anyone who did not read the Bible (a significant part of the population ) or Charles Fort (a larger portion). As a little read person, I thought this movie was a bad imitation of a seinfeld episode. Do not waste time. It would be better to lose reading ... ... anything to be honest
