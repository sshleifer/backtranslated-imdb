The mood of this movie is pretty good and captures the sensation of the '80s well with some good performances. However ..... The script is driven by the mill, except for a few moments of comedy and it comes as strange if I expected it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally dramatic, incredible and full of right-wing cliches, which the screenwriter probably saw watching a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie does not have a real story. Beat all the right "arty" boxes, but nothing really happens and at the end you are wondering what the point was. Very disappointing
