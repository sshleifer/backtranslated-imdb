I had high expectations of "My Beautiful Washer," "Bend It Like Beckham," and (less) "The East Is East". The history of British Asians in their adopted home had many good rounds on the big screen as well as a series of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness with Kindness, etc.). It collapses. Despite a good start, he quickly descended to the hill. Eventually, it was a horrible BBC effort, full of strong regional accents, scary characters, a soundtrack "those were the days" and a lot of "trouble" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I woke up at many points during this movie. The scenario is predictable. Each possible cliche was dragged and diffused. In fact, I have problems thinking about any inter-cultural / transversal devices that could have been used that were not. The characters were thin and clich√©: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the old woman, well understood, but eventually racist; excess weight, arrogant aunt; the Indian kings; the neighbor of the working class; "grandmother" deep; riding biker. The scenario was weak, with all the chances of shocking the public with openly racist dialogue from the two white racist characters taken. And why it had to be established in the 1970s (besides having an apology for the 1970s soundtrack) is a mystery. It may make the incredible characters become more credible for people born after 1979. I do not know. Even to these things, good action could have led to a respectable obscurity. Instead, ordinary suspects of the "BBC comedy" were sent to defeat him. "Bend it like Beckham" had a much better comedy action (and actually a serious action), with an almost unknown cast. In conclusion, a lazy, cliche script, acted in a predictable boring prediction. Give him a wish. <br /> <br />
