I do not know what the Oscar voters saw in this film, but they have to see some things pretty hard to see in it so they can bestow it with the best Oscar picture. All I know is, fortunately, it was Gene Kelly playing in it or it would have been twice as bad as I think it is. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron was really ready to play such a role. She is not so talented, not a great dancer, and she does not look good at all. It is a shame that an actor or actress can ruin a movie as if he were playing in it because if Leslie Caron had not been in this, he could have made an extraordinary movie. The story was smart, the direction was not bad and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron just to criticize it, I'm just saying it because I think this is the worst part of the movie. She is probably a good actress, but I can not say because I have not seen it in anything but I think it was bad enough in "An American in Paris". So if you want to see this, continue, but I tell you that you're better to watch Singin in the rain.
