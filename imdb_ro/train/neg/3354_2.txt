In my opinion, when you decide to re-create a very good film, you must strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a new point of view. Now, Robert Wise's 1963 story about Shirley Jackson's remarkable "Haunting of Hill House" is worth the admission even today. Now before 1999 and re-do. I was left shaking my head and wondering, why? The actress is wooden, the story is not recognized and the whole point seems to be replacing the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects as the computers can generate. I hear the update was bad; but could not believe it was so bad, given the source material. I was wrong. After looking at her and telling my wife how terrible she was, she said; "Well, they took your money!" He's right, do not let yours. If there is no profit in re-making, they may stop doing them or they will reach a higher standard that does not insult their audience
