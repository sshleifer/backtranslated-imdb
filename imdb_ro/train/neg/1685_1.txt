All children aged 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only 18 years old). They heard it was a very scary film and they felt so cool when they looked at it. I feel very sad children can not see what a good movie is and what is a bad movie. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a few months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's over ... why? Because it's impossible to come with a decent one for such a bad story. This movie is just made to make you scare, and if you are a bit clever and you know something about music, you know exactly when you will be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over and I returned to my friend and told him (a bit hard) that this was a waste of money, a stupid child seemed strange to me. Today, I could make an Oscar with a movie of my golden home, if I only use marketing right.
