This movie is a total waste of time, the plot is awful, the dialogue is terrible. The actor is fine, but the actors have absolutely no plot or scenario to work on. The photo and some of the special effects are fine, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the story is total stupidity. It's not even scary. For a movie to be scary, there must be at least a small credibility. This film has no credibility at all. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is superficial and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and doing the work are so badly done, or the most mediocre. I hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see a completely horrible movie.
