He caught this on IFC yesterday, and I can not believe the positive comments! Am I the only one who thought these "ladies" were anything but? Kate tells Jed that he could be fired because he should be a pillar of the community, but he puts it on! Then they suddenly decide that they are in love? And is so devastated upon his death, he does not go to his funeral, much less, tells his family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American become a director of a very good British school? Janine should have kicked in for the unexplained abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she is spinning in a cone in which she brought her for interrogation! And the less they talked about Molly, the better! As for the guilt, Janine and Molly feel connected to Jed, please! It is the fault of his own punk, he has become a roadkill! Where's the poor Gerald, who's getting angry? If I could do the same thing with the bosai behind this "movie"!
