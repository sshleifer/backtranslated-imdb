However, another adventure in the field of teen-gross-out-comedy, put on a college campus that has as its object a cool guide and how it decides to blackmail a trio of popular jockeys to make him face . Everything was done before, and everything was done in a much more satisfactory way. The humorous humor of teenage movies such as "American Pie" and "Where is my car" so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment, which appears so completely random that the viewer can only frown and to disapprove. The film is badly written and the actors never manage to make any of them even easy to survive. I will not even deny this terrible image through disclosure, because it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers never manages to entertain or cause laughter, and in the worst case it is badly tortuous and sometimes completely unfinished. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed his debut, Rushmore, humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and wonders how a career can get into the toilet so quickly. Avoid avoidance, please avoid. Save your money.
