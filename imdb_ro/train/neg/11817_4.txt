A pretty scifi environment. The plot was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although the act was reasonably good, the writing seemed very clickable, using ideas taken from numerous films. Base: Scientists working on a deep space research platform save a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf have blinded. On board, I find a bridge stasis, which coincidentally works flawily at the time. After two or three minutes from the waking man, you realize he's a complete madman. Something that totally escapes the crew of 3 people on the research ship ... Then it gets a shot from any other film involving a psychotic madman that terrorizes innocent victims, I generally think Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of the subject which I did not consider a good movie. It's not a good movie, you get foreigners and watch it again. <br /> <br />
