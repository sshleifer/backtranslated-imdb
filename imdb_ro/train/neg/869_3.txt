Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately, for me and for anyone else who has free time and a dollar available (remember that was the price I paid, I got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was supposed to be a thriller. The only THRILL I had was the pursuit of Kirkland, Anne Wilkes, in the snowy Misery area. If you want a good laugh, in a rainy Friday rain with some friends, then I recommend this movie. But if you want to look at something at least half decent, then you do not even bother. I for one am glad of horrible movies, the worse, the better in most cases. But Wow ... I'm thinking WOW! The only person in the whole movie that did not fill it was the little boy played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I give him even 3 stars is that he gave me something to do.
