Janeane Garofalo was very public in dissatisfaction with this film, calling him, among other things, antifeminist. He also said in his radio show that he does not like to make "romantic comedies" because he does not believe in them. With all my heart I agree with Janeane here. This movie is the best. She does everything possible but, overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world. While there will be some who will say "stop your mistrust," you get tired of suspending it almost every time you get a romantic Hollywood movie. Janeane's character is usually filmed in shadows and in the dark, which makes it unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (probably would not have liked Janeane and probably one of the reasons why this film is detestable). That even damages the movie if we have to buy the premise that Janeane should be better off looking for the two. As many have said here on other comment topics, Janeane is not ugly, but actually quite beautiful. I did not read any comments that someone said that Uma would be better. Still, I think Ben Chaplin's character would have been more than likely with Uma, not with Janeane. Many men do not like the truly intelligent women (and many women do not like really intelligent men) and, unfortunately, Ben is probably left with Uma. And, despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. Her natural beauty comes anyway. I think a lot of Janeane's male fans, who are obsessed with her as this movie, because they like to think about them in the character of Ben Chaplin and in fact mark Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character he's playing here (real life is always more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower. This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, because this movie is really not good.
