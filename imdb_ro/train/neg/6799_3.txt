do not expect too much of this movie. In many ways, this movie resembles a film that Doris Day played in 1956, the title, Julie. In this film, Doris, who was flight attendant, stewardess, in those days, landed flying craft after her disturbed husband, played by Louis Jordan shot captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and managed to land without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I use myself to be a flight attendant. As I said, you do not expect too much of this movie, it was made at a cheap budget. Manufacturers would have had to use a plane with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name that has used several movies. The only one on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
