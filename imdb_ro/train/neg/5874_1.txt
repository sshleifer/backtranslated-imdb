one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The scene of careful action and a very bad action also does not help. The only good point is Gary Busey's songs, but that does not really make the film much. is up to its B rating and passes the flying color test. A loss of my money, although I found fun to get started with it gets annoying after a few hours. I do not recommend this movie unless you watch it for free or a gift. (a gift you can ask for and send back for a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
