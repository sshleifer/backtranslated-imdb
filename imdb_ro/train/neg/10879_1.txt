Blades, blades, blades !!! A 90-minute fest, with a length of 89 minutes. An atmosphere and a possibility (an abandoned monastery) is scattered by a scenario full of humorous dialogue that is so hot that it is hip. Most of the time it's just embarrassing, and gonzo horror trials collapse (a sample of this film's dialogue: after demonstrating artillery, quickly shot at a detail of Barbeau's vigilant character, she: "Any question?" Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad, idiotic, homophobic and judging by the effects of the creature, it seems that the director has looked too many times on the "Evil Dead" path. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a long time to rent this turkey and subject them to lost ninety minutes that they will never come back. What a flock.
