The landscape is cute and the dog is cute. Besides, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is as brilliant as usual, but the script is so horrible that even he is unleashed. The plot does not make sense, the dialogue is bad and there are many smaller mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
