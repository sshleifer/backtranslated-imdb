The premise, though not ridiculous, was certainly ridiculous. What was supposed to happen at the second encounter with Tritter was that Tritter should just be wasted. The house hires a guy and destroys Tritter. In real life, Tritter would have been harassed, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, offering reasons and opportunities, and hospital attorneys would have made Tritter meat and the special department for which he worked. He would be in prison as if someone were complicating the harassment of House, Chase, Foreman, Cameron, Wilson, and Cuddy. The process would have won the House a tasty place enough to prevent him from offering Vicadin in old age. While Tritter would end up driving a taxi somewhere, trying to rehabilitate by doing good to the people for two years before people fell to seeing them before.
