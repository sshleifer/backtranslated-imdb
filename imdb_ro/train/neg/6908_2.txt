This series had potential, but I think the budget would not allow it to see this potential. An interesting configuration, which does not differ from the "lost", collapses after the first episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a 90-minute film, but the producers chose to shoot and shoot him. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work as a whole. There were few characters who cared for us, while their characters did not grow over time - well, one grew a little. The end was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only kudos here are in the department of art and cabinets, they created an interesting, too bad look, the writer and the director did not have the vision to do something interesting with that element
