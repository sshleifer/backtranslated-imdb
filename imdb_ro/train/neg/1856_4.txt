I'm so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction to the movies produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment and, without exception, all that this company is doing is pure fool! First, and this is very important, never look this movie awake! Why are you? Unlike many other entertainment movies, it feels it was intentionally done badly. I can not figure out how fake a snowman is, so he always shows up only briefly, the way he moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaaay better than Michael Keaton's piece of shit, which was made too good a movie, and that this version is as bad as it is.
