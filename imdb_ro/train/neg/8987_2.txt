The only quality of redeeming this movie is the real story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The actress was ridiculously bad, and the design of the set was sticky and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very hard to watch because of all the horrific actors. I would not recommend watching him ... The only quality of redemption of this movie was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the role of the soap opera star. Some edits have been well done, but there are flaws of continuity everywhere ... I just start getting sick and tired of seeing gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon?
