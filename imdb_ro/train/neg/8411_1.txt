We were expecting something great when we came to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway piece on the film. Music is terrible. There is no memorable song in the movie - have they heard any results from this movie? You will not be because it does not exist. Some of the musical numbers go so long that I woke up to go to the toilet and get some pop corn and I was still going back when I came back! If good songs were good - but they suck. Rhythm is a slow, terrible development. The leadership was praised for her song, but she sounded like she was screaming every song - it was almost impossible to stand. This film has nothing to offer to anyone but Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the best-rated movie I've ever seen in my life. A full amount of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie, except for Danny Glover - who was not on the screen enough and whose character was not developed enough. Rent the video and you will agree - this movie was an expensive, over-produced, polished dog.
