Normally, I do not like revenge movies ... PERIOD. But Double Impact has little more than your typical retaliation premise. See, DI has action, exactitude, exotic locations (ie, Hong Kong), wonderful fighting of weapons and enough martial arts to satisfy your craving for unarmed combat. Just like all revenge moves, you have villains you'd like to throw out of a glass window on the top floor of a 40-storey building! However, Double Impact does not have any of the sensational nonsense that suffocates the elitism, racist, and venal social plot and stereotypes that have invaded Eye for a Eye and Death Wish 2. the Double Impact plot is as transparent as the Saran foil. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mobile phone hit team connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of the reason boys were speaking in French accents is crazy. It was not the watered plot that made this film bad, but the use of clich√© lines and moves from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to Princess Bride) really made it worse. However, Double Impact is still to be watched. But why are those shit movies like this that are wrongdoers (for example, the British greedy who killed the parents of Chad and Alex and that fat lewd redheaded cat) would you like to hate the fiber of your being?
