This movie is acting horribly, written, directed and produced. But it is so camouflaged that it is actually semi-pursued. This is SEMI to be tracked. The story (which little exists) has virtually no meaning. Barney Drum character is the only comic relief of the movie and tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian distributions can be found in TV commercials. None of them has gone to anything else I know about. And of course Sly Stallone's brother, even less talented ..... = = Trivia: The film was shot almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles from Toronto) we have recognized many local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the Drive-in scenario was filmed at the demolition of Oshawa Drive-in right before it was broken.
