Watching Tom Hanks as a blow to the Irish crowd is like looking at Jimmy Stewart as a serious rapist, but it does not work. We had a very difficult time to accept this. I do not think Tom can act, that I followed my career at Maze and Monsters, but for some reason this has fallen. Maybe because I'm a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only form of life less than a fanboy is a cockroach) The film as a whole fails for me. Adding Jude Law, and dropping everything The rest left me to feel cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a big crime movie more in Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart of the story and left us with nothing but empty bones. There are things to please in this movie, yet the cinema is breathtaking to fill the screen with beautiful pictures Paul Newman is as usual and I even enjoyed the score, but Tom as the "Angel of Death" Sullivan was completely flat .
