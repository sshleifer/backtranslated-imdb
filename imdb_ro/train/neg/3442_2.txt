I hired this movie exclusively on the fact that the roof made me call. However, as soon as the movie started, I regretted. They seem to have used a home camera to film this movie and let a child do it. They also used inappropriate phantom faces and shapes to try and scare people, but I woke up laughing, I could have put it together, and I did a better job of it. As for the plot, I felt that they had some very good ideas, but because of unwanted lines and in some cases they were shady. I had no direction. I did not want to sit around because it caused me physical pain to look at her, but I always finish it, so I breathe deeply and let it go. Definitely 98 minutes of my life was wasted. I would save you the embarrassment that you know that you have watched "Haunted Boat" and find something more fun. I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but that was a great disappointment. I thought nothing could get worse after Terror Toons, but that made me reconsider myself. You're gonna drop it off. * (Stars is for ideas to have the worst fears for them)
