Gene Hackman is removed from prison by an unnamed government agency that wants him for an assassination. It is a matter of course that Hackman has the skills for this job. No one tells him anything, however, he is given that the public is given bits and information. It should be suspense, instead it is annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through the mission, but the getaway is puzzled and the guy at the tip of this mysterious entity orders all the dead to cover him. So everyone in the casting dies and you do not care at the end. One of the other commentators pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, almost three hours and was cut quite a bit. Maybe something was actually lost in translation, but I tend to think it was an act of mercy on the public. A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert is so wasted here is a murder. <br /> <br /> And we never know exactly what federal agency was doing all this, FBI, CIA, DEA or even the IRS.
