There are not enough homosexual films and there are not enough "out" movies. Each of them is a welcome addition for gender. Although the production values ​​are high (the film "looks" well, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) seems REAL good in a pair of jeans), this is a bad one. It's an epoch: homosexual life under the oppressive regime (East Berlin, 1989) a life that seems to be 40 years ago. In a way we see our history; as it was for homosexuals in the 1940s and '50s here (often reminded me of "The Last Exit in Brooklyn: The Book not the Movie"). But it is depressing and SLOW in a contradictory way that evoked an old SCTV message by Ingmar Bergman. It's so easy to edit, I wonder if the director did not hack at random. Yes, it is a miracle that this film was filmed and released before the Wall descends and gives, life behind the curtain was hard for gay people. A good director would have been able to show all of these things without astonishing the audience. A good director should have branded him as one of the best movies and not one of them.
