A pathetic movie. I will not waste too much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to get back a few hours that I've lost on her. Let me just leave with - Shaq does not have BUSINESS being an actor or singer. He is absolutely without talent in both directions. It is a shame that the more talented people scatter in community theaters and karaoke bars, while Shaq uses his name as basketball player to ruin the movies and cut CDs. the film was a pathetic talent that is not Shaq.
