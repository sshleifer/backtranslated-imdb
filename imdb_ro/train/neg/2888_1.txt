To compare this beating with old, low-budget pornography would be an insult to old, low-budget porn pornography. The scene of animals makes no sense, nor does it represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD cassette partly says "the resumption of BTK Killer's terrorist domination." This is not a retelling. An account would suggest that you are told the truth about what happened or how and why. None of these things is true. I'm an enthusiastic studio of serial killers and I've seen some beautiful movies about them, and honestly, it's not one of them. It's not even the BTK killer. Save some time and a few dollars and rent Dahmer instead. This serial killer movie is correct and true. However, if you just have to watch this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then you will still feel cheated.
