Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel like I have to say something. We were not exactly looking for a "splatterfest" as someone puts it, or even "blood and courage / gore". I have a respect for the relatives of the victims, even though I really felt the filmmaker did not. - They were without name, no sense, no sense. Just a Dahmer's antique sex bowl. I watched this movie with the morbid curiosity that makes me think "What makes a guy like to be a serial killer?" as well as questions about Dahmer's story, of which I know very little. People here seem to believe that the film should not cover the events in Dahmer's story. his history, what happened when he was caught, the next, etc. but it is IMPORTANT! You see, I suppose if you're an American you'll know all this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man, as it was obvious, REQUEST that at least some of the history and real events are said / shown. This does not mean blood and courage, there are ways to show horrible things in a engaging film or intelligent movies without resorting to gore. Without touching even what he did (I learned more about reading the user's comments on this site!), The movie felt like a goal. A moment in time, with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a film about Dahmer REAL because, due to lack of direction, very slow pace, which never changes, strange portrayal of homosexuality and VERY unfortunate lack of any attempt to end, this film is POOR. I would not recommend to anyone that I miss the time to look at it. 1 out of 10 (for acting!)
