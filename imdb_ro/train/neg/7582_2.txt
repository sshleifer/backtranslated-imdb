High holes are complicated things. They can raise women (or crossbones) to new heights, present a sharp style statement and bring a note of fragile elegance. Alternatively, this can be a dangerous foot pain, which will inevitably lead to travel, fall and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is rather a disappointing journey than an elegant crossroads. <br /> <br /> The drama of Almodóvar's mother-daughter is elegant, but in terms of plot there is a close and tiring, confusing, complicated, complex character that never engages or makes sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is not interesting. The best thing comes from the beginning in a wonderful case of murder murder, orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant black comedy, things look up, but then the film gets to a heel. There are quite powerful performances in acting and there is a stylish artistic direction that you would expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story about crime, show, femininity, fraudulent mother-daughter relationship, and a character that is alternatively a judge, a transvestite, and a police informant, it could have been a melodramatic power. Instead, he is poor. High heights are definitely prevented.
