This movie was almost intolerable to stay through. I can go beyond the fact that he was shot with a home camera and that this film should be stretched over weeks, yet the characters do not change the costumes once, but the action broke the fourth wall for me. I saw better action in a fourth-class game. Besides, the plot is unrealistic. If the man had suspected it would have let her come back. I was also very disappointed that all assassinations were made with a gun what kind of gore is that. This is not a cop that the Zodiac did not kill, using only a weapon, the authorities would have known it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when this is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disease. Overall, I think this film is not the type of film that could be achieved with a low budget at least not as low as it would have or could have ensured that they had better or more gore actors . A lot of people went down the low budget line without using the horrific actors looking at Easy Rider, who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson on a low budget.
