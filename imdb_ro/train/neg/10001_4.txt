This movie did not have something I could not have put my finger at first: the charisma of the leading actress. This was inevitably translated into lack of chemistry when he divided the screen with his leading man. Even the romantic scenes appeared as just the actors in the game. The director who misinterpreted what he had from the actors was very good. I do not know. But could it be the scenario? Just exactly who was the cook in love? He seemed more enthusiastic about his skills and culinary restaurant, and ultimately he and his young exploits than anyone or anything else. He never convinced me he was in love with the princess. I was disappointed in this movie. But, do not forget that he was nominated for Oscar, so judge for yourself.
