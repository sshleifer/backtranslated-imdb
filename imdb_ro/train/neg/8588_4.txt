Revenge begins with a long-lasting action sequence that is impressive without being terribly interesting, then it becomes very boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have affected the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the action is slow - and I mean slow - build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, it's pretty good. Not great. Not even good. But pretty good. This movie is much being overpriced because it is not pathetic as previous sequelae. Instead, it's just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGIs are sometimes impressive sometimes. How do you fight the lights? It's a miserable misery. I think the dark side grabbed Lucas when he started these prequel and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thanks God has finished, this franchise once worship was beaten down enough. I saw the show 12:01, and after I heard a group of very young children say, wow it was wonderful! But all eight-elders muttered the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I thought I could see that Darth Vader's birth would be better. That's what we all said.
