This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack dramatically stronger than dialogue? What sense does this make? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do so now. For 2 years, I wondered if there is anything wrong with my TV, but then I have a new TV and there it is again. THE BACKGROUND The noise that could take place in a city block behind the actors induces dialogue. It was even more distracting in this movie because, anyway, in the English version, the woman is constantly grunting. I still hoped that Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, you will speak or marble out of your mouth." If you watch it on DVD and you even have French high school, I recommend you the French version with subtitles. I give him 4 because Reno was so good at Leon. People are raves about the landscape, but I've seen it on a TV and lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
