I have not been able to decide if this movie is so bad that it's good or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad that it has gone well and has returned to the worst." It does not matter, it forced me to look just like a strange colorful burst of vomiting and offers a series of scenes that you will not even forget if you want. He's a young lame guy, Ray Liotta, who tells a pig-irony that her creative trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray is again molesting Pia, not with a suitable trophy, but with a garden hose. There is an impressed Pia company, telling his domineering mother that she wants to sleep with Ray's father, Walter's father. There is the actress on the stage of the cemetery, which shakes the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWHHHHYYYYYYY!" It's the garden hose again, as Walter rotates his face and yells "It's more pleasure!" The pie and her encounter are lit by the mutual closure of the mastication salad that begins to break its clothes. The pie is filled, but she forgets to remove her dress. Perhaps it's best to write Pia's letters, but instead of keys there are the thumbnails of those who have tormented the most (then I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, at The Awards, exposing Hollywood for the tank, spitting the second best line so far: "I think I'm not the only one who ever had to get to the top." I saw I already spent more time commenting on "The Lonely Lady" than on better pictures, so I will give up. Be warned, though, that once you start watching, you probably will not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life will disappear forever.
