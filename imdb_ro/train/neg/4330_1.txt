Last night, I decided to look at the prequel or call the so-called prequel at Way Carlito - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" that went directly to DVD ... no wonder ... it's completely .. and i mean totally S% & KS !!! time waist watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of writing about it .... I do not understand how De Palma agreed to produce this sh # t-fest of a movie .... except only a fact of breaking my hat ... Jay Hernandez, who plays the role of young Brigante ... reminded me how De Niro got to Brando to portray young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the De Niro difference it was amazing and even got an Oscar for it! Jay Hernandez and he has the courage to try to be a young Pacino ... too bad for him I do not think he will play in the movie and after watching this movie, I sat down and followed the original path of Carlitos to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
