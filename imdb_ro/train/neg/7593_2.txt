I do not like this movie, but then I did not think too much about the book which, although it was praised by many as a "masterpiece", found a lack of character development and disjointed and illogical in the plot, although it was much more much easier to read than Fante's first furious effort, "Road to Los Angeles," which was not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid-1980s. I was intrigued to see what kind of soup Towne would do with ingredients so weak. He worked hard in the script to fix many shortcomings of the book, but because my money did not save him. There has never been a movie in Ask the Dust as he tried to remain faithful to the book. I consider this film Towne's madness. In a word: forgetful.
