A plot that shone and faded from the irreconcilable differences in opinions was a bloody evil, with pro-life on its side, and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was left out and replaced by a generally boring effect, quite possibly meant to be horrible, but instead showed a bad dose of beliefs that had risen to death, despite the title proper. Being a fan of Masters of Horror at first, this ridiculous plot with sordid images collapsed like an old rocking chair after being seated. I see this episode as being thrown together from going, never really taking off anywhere else than seeing it for what it deserves and improved when it finally came to "The End" ..
