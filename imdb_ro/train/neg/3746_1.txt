As hard as I do, with all the terrible reality shows in recent years, it has to take over the top for the worst one yet. I still wonder if this was actually just a scandal made by the SCTV band. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind him. Can a rock band bend lower than the INXS have to do such a shameful thing like that? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition rejects a karaoke piece to become INXS's new lead singer to replace Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no later, troops engage in the latest pathetic act, subjecting themselves to listening to a talent-free group of talents to be the new leading singer of a band that is twenty years after its first encounter. So, they slip all these terrible singers (I thought the American Idol has lots of doses), which interprets mistakes close to every classic (and predictable) rock song. And then they cut INXS members who seriously discuss the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock artists at almost any night club in any city in the world. It has all the usual non-creatures of any other reality show. Participants in reality, blades, lame host / emcee, judging blades of performances and boot blades of a participant at the end of each show. Can these predictions be more predictable? It's clearly a stunt of advertising from the band; a last hope of hope in rekindling their lost state before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any dignity when he is alive, must roll in the tomb. Not that INXS has ever been a great band, but I did not think I was pathetic. If INXS are not at all representative of what has become rock and roll, this show would be the final proof that rock-roll is once dead forever.
