The genre of suspense movies really does a diving in this. The big problem is IMPUSABILITY. I realize that you have to create difficult situations that would cause suspense and tense feeling of what will happen next, but this movie was so predictable and not credible. I have noticed that the more I look at this type of film, the more I tell the actors things continuously to remove them from danger. Continuous determination of wrong decisions is limited to being bad. If they had time to make it more realistic, I might have enjoyed a little. Once you have said this, you might want to stay away from it.
