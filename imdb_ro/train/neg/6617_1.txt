It really looks like hype is not everything. Shows and what is a terrible actor abhishek and receives only movies because of his father and his wife. Amitabh as always is solid. Ajay Devgan as always is shit and useless and the new guy is a joke. The lord of leadership is such a loss of an actor. Such a pathetic film from such a reverend director and from such a great industry. With films as such, I have lowered the amount of Bollywood movies I'm watching. RGV has made some strange movies for a while. It's time to bring different actors. Hrithek someone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Any other leading lady is a half-naked woman. Pffffft.
