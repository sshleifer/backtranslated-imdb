Like many others who have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've ever seen. There will be no direct references to the movie parks or sequences in this comment, because they hate spoilers. I feel like watching an episode of a TV show or something like the extra spending to spend on CGI (I've seen it worse) ... Overall, it's a pretty big island for the spectator, at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology at all. There are too many of these insulting moments to make me feel comfortable and I just woke up asking for everything to end - fast - halfway. Additionally, there are countless "easy out" scenarios, which also represent an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... This movie disappears absolutely compared to the old "Wargames," and I think it's a damn shame that they even called it a sequel. Two stars from me because of one thing and one thing: actors' performances are not half bad, given the recurring words of a scenario we were supposed to work with. Still, they should never have been part of this movie. It's not really a career move, but I think we all have paychecks. For those of you who gave the top score of the movie ... you have to be on the studio's salary or something like this my only explanation. For all who have not seen it: by all means, watch it and create your own mind. But reduce your expectations to the floor (and then to some).
