For the first time in years, I felt the need to connect to IMDb today to get rid of this movie by writing a review because it was just such a deterrent to watch. The plan sounded great when I read it, I expected a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic ghost hunt. Unfortunately, everything is so badly hurt by a mundane and tiring love story and too many silly and "foolish" movies that have no say, just agonizing. Here is a brief leak of the most serious crimes in this movie: The script relies so much on the inexplicable and inexplicable coincidence and stupidity of the film. the main characters that is just ridiculous. No, actually, he's angry. And lazy. - About this: cheap emotions. Long parade, "on time". <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Well, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced real human beings in real life, but has gained all his knowledge from bad movies. Thus, his characters are tedious, second-generation life-clich√©s. They are simple plotting devices, places without the slightest bit of personality. They are "a man and a woman in despair who still love". She has not seen this before except in 100,000 movies and is no longer realistic or enjoyable. Think of the most glamorous Hollywood tariff in two dimensions and you have it. There is no character in this movie that is just fresh, charming or interesting. Vague resolution that moves very badly and needs only one clue to overthrow, although the word "resolution" might be inappropriate here, because the movie is a messy mess that does not go anyway anyway. As you pass, however, you do not care. The last third of the movie I just sent to her, because it was so unbearable to look. Okay, that's all. Whatever the redeemings of this film, everything is buried under incompetence. Do not look at this.
