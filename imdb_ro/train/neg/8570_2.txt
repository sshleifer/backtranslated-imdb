There is only one essential thing for an in-depth appreciation of the Indian runner. Unfold your pants. Look inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Okay, you're gonna make this movie. This film has all the masculine requisites: blood, weapons, tracking machines, founding women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics - what have I left? - Oh, yeah, blowing. As a woman, I seriously hope Sean Penn to consider this as a kind of effort "when I was a kid ...". Since both he wrote and directed things, he is almost alone responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen, as usual, brilliantly demonstrating the way things should be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. Lines and actions are there. Even devoted, qualified acting can not change these. I found this foolish and silly movie as well as predictable. Dialogue takes place over time - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a maternal monologue without maternal authenticity. Then he dies. After a while, so did the father of the protagonists, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is hard to notice. At the time intervals, pyrotechnics, etc., mentioned above, seem to be damaging things and scaring the public into thinking that something significant is happening. <br /> <br /> If you are a man under 25, you can adore this movie. Plan to go back at 35 o'clock. Think you'll want it again? I do not think.
