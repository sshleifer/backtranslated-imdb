This movie must be the worst I've ever seen. The title of the movie deceives the public to think there hopefully. The story line of the movie is ridiculous at best, and acting so poorly, you just have to wander. The title "Zombie Nation" involves a sentence of zombies when, in fact, there are six in total. This can not be classified as a horror film because of the introduction of cheese music 80 when the zombies attack. Zombies actually talk and behave like human beings in the film, the only difference being what looks like something in a La Roux movie. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie, then do this, then burn the copy.
