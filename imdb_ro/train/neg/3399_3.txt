The birthday girl does not know what she wants to be - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... she just does not know. What could have been a very funny or excited film would end up in nobody's country. The premise is sufficiently original to guarantee a scenario full of exciting scenarios, but it does not offer and ends. It's a real shame if you look at distribution - it's very solid to the end, but you do not have the chance to shine. Very disappointing.
