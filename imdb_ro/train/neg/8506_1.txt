This could actually be the worst movie I've ever had. Incoherence would be a compliment. Even the end had no meaning, but it was a tremendous relief that it ended. I watched it with a fatal fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate. By the end of this mess, I was sorry that any of the characters survived and I did not feel too good with the actors. If you want to watch a train, I recommend you go to a train station. Even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. It seems that I have not ventilated enough to meet ten prescribed lines, so at the risk of redundancy I will say it once again. This movie is zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
