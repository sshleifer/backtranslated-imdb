The premise is amazing and some of the actors, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, are charming ... but this movie is almost undiscovered. The music sounds like it comes from a kind of unmanaged website and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the tour. Most of the song is off-key. I think they were filming with accapella and put the music under it ... The dialogue is really stupid and cute. The film works best when it comes to reality, but unfortunately, it often laughs in stupid sub-plots. I woke up checking my watch after the first twenty minutes and 40 questions "when it will ever end".
