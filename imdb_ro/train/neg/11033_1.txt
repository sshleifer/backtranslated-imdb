The latest rumor is that Vh1 starts making calls for "I Love New York" in mid-2008. So, does that mean Buddha or Tailor made New York dump or does that mean New York pulled out the winner? I know Flavor of Love comes up to the third season, so now, with a love of love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... will it ever be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I have heard some rumors that Chance will be brought back for Season 3 of I Love New York !!!! I also heard rumors that New York will be Special Featured on Flavor of Love 3. Hopefully this was not much of a spoiler for the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just referring to the last rumor.
