I'm sorry to say that there is no way, in my opinion, that an Enzo could really keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to advance in weight possessed by S7 would be just too great. S7 has a power ratio of 3.93 lb / hp, while Enzo has 4.61 lb / hp. Also, the lower limit of S7 is much better. I'm sorry about the Ferrari fans, but Saleen just did it a lot better. As far as other parts of this film are concerned, I must say that it is so substandard to be pathetic. The story is too weak. Action in this lemon is worse than soaps during the day. I can say that, as far as it is a negative psychology treaty, it is a kind of gem. This film is nothing, if not an obvious definition of narcissism and sociopathy. Everything about these rich punks takes their rocks while showing only traces of remorse made to all innocent road users that cause injuries or death too. I can not give the movie a "star star" because it does not make me leave the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful, blue-eyed brown brunette as the lead female saves her from being totally absent ... although there is no way her singing puts it on the cover of "Variety ". ps: The guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO's stringed version by James Vanderbeek.
