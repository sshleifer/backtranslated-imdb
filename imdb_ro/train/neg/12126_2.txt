Here again is another Diane Lane movie in case she cheated on her husband. Is that the only role he can play? This time she was settled in 1969 and deceives her husband with the blouse. I'm not so surprised because it's so predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man, because it is a very boring film. Then, after throwing some milk, she is sorry and she sees the man again. Spirit. Then, as she does with her, her son is killed by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at a wasp nest. This mom did not have time to tell her this, she was too busy with the blouse.
