By far, the most important requirement for any film that traitors of trustworthy traitors is that they must at least occasionally be able to shoot each other, as well as their discontented marks, policemen, crowd and (ideally). But this film NEVER does that. Any scam can be seen coming at a mile (especially at sea!). They are not very interesting, complicated or sophisticated. Perhaps Mammet hopes to compensate for this with a quick and complex psychological dialogue. If so, it failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in such a stylish, unnatural, stylized way that I thought it could have become a smart point about us all who are acting all the time ... but it was not. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a bit repressed and makes some Freudian slides forced by her father, believing she is a whore, but she goes beyond her. I really enjoyed the street scenes. Looked like a painting by Edward Hopper.
