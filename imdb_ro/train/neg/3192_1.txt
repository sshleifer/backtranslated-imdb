What the reviewers gave up and the MST3K is the best track (and only a memorable scene) of this otherwise awesome film: There is a very good scene of bad-type kidnappings (Ben Gazzara) as mentioned, later killed by the ineptitude to TJ). Perhaps rape is a too powerful word, "the mating ritual of the prison" may be more appropriate. The background behind this chance, but still forced, is the encounter with the mobster who hides "Ben Gazzara", introducing it to the girls watching his pool. The 30-year-old blonde scatters them, but our bastard has to be hit by it, because the rainbow is at that moment. His first move is to try to drown him until his benefactor mafia tells him to beat him. Something like a high school girl you did not like, but she still wanted to have a carnal knowledge anyway ... Let's just say she's getting her up with her in the cottage.
