When I was a kid in the 1950s and 1960s, anything about Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to bring the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but they ... they mistaken things! This movie is shit. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad. Just because of the talents of the actors I can give even 3 10.
