The worst thing about Crush is not that it acted badly or that the intrigue is virtually non-existent and it's not so bad that working with the room might have been better. No, the worst part of this movie is that it has some absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping there's still a lot to do. But, in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearjerking scenes of over 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage - then, by all means, do not miss. just excited to see the things listed above in a movie and, as a result, I had a pretty horrible time. Some absolutely brilliant jokes can not compensate for the rest. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 4/10. Guilty of losing my time. <br /> <br />
