I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in a movie! Gingerbread Man starts from the right foot and manages to build some great expectations for the end. But at one point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever lost my time. It is as incredible as Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's nose. The highlight is as uninteresting and flat as a beer that has been left in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably the worst film Grisham ever and this is not changed by the fact that talented stars agglomerate the movie. Do not waste your time here!
