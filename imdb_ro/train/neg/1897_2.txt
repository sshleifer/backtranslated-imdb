It was a terrible movie! I gave her 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and the other for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... Apart from the fact that the story was just sucked and the cars that were racing through the cities were not so new in 1970. Happyend was probably what what annoyed me most, seldom seen something so built!
