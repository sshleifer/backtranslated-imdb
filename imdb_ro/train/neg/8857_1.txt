This movie is very bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save him. A poor story, an even poorer scenario and just a bad direction make this movie a truly horrible film, the essential part being the only horror movie I can honestly say I will not forget never ever. This garbage makes the new outerspace plan look like Oscar.
