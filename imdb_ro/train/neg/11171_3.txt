Very much a movie of the past - extremely long sequences, no dialogue, bad flashbacks and almost masculine distribution. The two women who have a total of less than 10 lines and are just as romantic men's interests. O'Toole is riveted whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through the bushes. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see, but he is also terribly underutilized. The film has an additional positive aspect in that it describes many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathy (such as the casual appearance of Mosley graffiti) that many people today do not know. Too many of today's World War II films paint allies as good and Axis as bad as history tells us that people are much more complicated than that! This would be a good movie when you recover from the flu and you are tied on the couch and you can not absorb something too complex. If you only need something to pass the time while stabilizing the electrolytes, this is the movie for you.
