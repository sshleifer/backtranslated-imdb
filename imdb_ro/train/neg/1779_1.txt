It could have been a Marvelous story Based on old cats cats, but it was not that could be just that. wonderful and full of mythological references that kept my energized fascination. The lead characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause, and his mother Maria, performed by Alice Krige) were made shallowly, had no depth of personality and were hardly sympathetic or drawing. Not even the character of MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played the role of Tanya Robertson) does not fit that description. <br /> <br /> However, as I said many times before, when you adapt a novel by Stephen King to TV, you just have to consider that his books are not written for TV, and his tale talent, unfortunately, does not have the fire and the depth he presents as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another attempt to take the magic of Stephen King's writing, whether it's a novel or an original script. Simply cut and paste your work on the small screen. His stories are completely bastarded in this process and everything you do to the end is a beautiful film; nothing less, but certainly nothing else. His scriptures are beaten and lost. Unfortunately, this translation of the script was a wish. <br /> <br /> We are sorry, sorry, sorry. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
