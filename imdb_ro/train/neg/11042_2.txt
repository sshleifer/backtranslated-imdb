I would like to say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is accustomed in every way. He has the dumb husband, his smarter, but more boring and convenient wife, along with the "comic" idiot - the predictable jokes, with more predictable reactions from the blast, highlight these harmful narcotic narcotics lines of mental narcotics that leaves me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more similar to an induced coma. But it could be for a while yet, because it gives the average American character a truly identifiable character. An "ordinary" guy just like you and me. I live in the South of the USA, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. Here, that unpleasant character is everywhere, in one form or another. Watching it on TV is brutal.
