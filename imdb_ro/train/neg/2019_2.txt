Dude, that was sucked ... I could not get any more of this camp worth ...... and I stayed all the time on Showtime .... Do not bother to wait around the "empty" either. .... It's too late and only Jenna Jameson plastic is involved .. Show how much discretionary cash you need to get around Hollywood just to get your name on closing credits .. I think Showtime had to to throw something at 1 am ... Next time I think it would be better to see the ESPN loop every 30 minutes ...
