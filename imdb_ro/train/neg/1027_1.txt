Normally, I have much better time to do than write reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour recording with IMDb just to get it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think of a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bancable bet ... well, this movie was terrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend the unbelief"; I tried, indeed, I wanted to be glad, but Justin Timberlake would not leave me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stay on music, which is a terrible performance - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can not blame Justin: The movie also boasts a terrible plot and a wrong editing; certainly "F". After seeing this, I have to wonder what motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan read the script before taking his share. Did not she see how poor she was? What could then motivate him to take his share? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more about who you see than a quality activity that really develops. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really is struggling to get along with the poor scenario. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience goes: "What the hell is going on here, are you expecting me to believe this shit?" In short, besides Justin a large wrong-executed line - very disappointing.
