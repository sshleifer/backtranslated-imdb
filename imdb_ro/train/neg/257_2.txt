I like Jamie Foxx. And I like 99% of all the movies I see. And I got out of this. Now, I admit, maybe she had something to do with the two middle-aged white women behind the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh, no, Jamie knocks on a door, HEE HEE HEE!") But ... That was so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained blow to the camera, and no room was shot at a conventional angle ... it all had to be ahead, hard and annoying. The bad guy tried Malkovici smooth, but at this moment he's just old and tired. It did not bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you've seen come, too many you've heard before and too many "harsh" lines ... and I do not mind this kind of thing, indeed, as long as there is a bit of originality. In fact, almost all of the support distribution was just sucked. I like Jamie Foxx, and I think it's very funny and I thought it was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough for me to endure anything else. <br /> <br /> This film needed fewer photos, less annoying, more emotions, more sensation and more Jamie Foxx. I gave her a 2.
