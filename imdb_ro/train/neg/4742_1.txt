Wow. It was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song performs Wendy, the most famous girl with her hot jockey lover, and has embraced friends who are determined to be Queen of Homecoming. She should save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to help them with martial arts. Shin teaches the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and must learn some techniques to save the world. This movie is great for children who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but the act and casting was horrible. Brenda Song is a comic actress and I do not see her playing a serious role. He laughed funny, looking at Shin's cry. Shin was unable to act at all and everything was totally unbelievable. I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing I came to was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake that the stunts were so powerful that they could hurt and say it. The characters were not pleasant and I could not stand to look at her. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, alongside other films such as Ship Jumping, Color of Friendship, Go Figura, Read it and Cry and Stuck in Suburbs. you love action-adventure and jokes corny, you will love this movie.
