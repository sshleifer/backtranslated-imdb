From the movie digitized in blocks to the act that makes Keanu "I'm so woody, I might be a Plank." Reeves looks like an Oscar winner this bitten film (not intentionally). The best thing about this is the 2-eRATicate box (which of the three seemed to be the most powerful piece in terms of story and twist). I would have liked to spend 3.99 pounds worth of something else, like ... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really in a disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid it as a plague. If you're looking for something amateur and actors that are more wood than a 2x4, then move on. However, if you want to do a werewolf action elsewhere, like the soldier dog, Wolfen, Romasanta: Hunt werewolf.
