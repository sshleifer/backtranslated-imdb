Following the fact that Cleopatra Jones is much better in 1973, there is Tamara Dobson's black actress actress who returns to her signature role as a chic, super-tough narcotics agent who has beaten a heroine ring in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination blaxploitation action-film and kung-fu B-film is fun at first but eventually flags. The strike finale is right off the assembly line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she makes a unique rotation in her dialogue, but that's too much of a thing for her - it's jaded ). Stella Stevens plays this vivacity this time; she is good, but she can not fit with Shelley Winters in his predecessor. ** from ****
