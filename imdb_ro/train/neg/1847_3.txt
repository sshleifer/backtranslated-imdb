SCHIZOPHRENIAC: The MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of people untied together to make a terrible horror movie. Any kind of acting, production, story, FX, etc. ... go out in the window in an effort to create "shock value." Now do not get me wrong - I think I'm a connoisseur of "shock" films, and the best / most expensive / horny / nasty - but it's still nice to see a talent from someone involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo, a drug addicted drug addict who orders him to kill his ventrilock dummy Rubberneck. She goes a few years killing prostitutes and other random people and screaming how much he hates them "hoo-uhs" (who are "bitch" for those of you who do not speak New York ...) and how he wants to They raped her ass. There are a few bad scenes of necrophilia, very little gore and nudity that mix things a little - but nothing you've ever seen in a better movie ... The only redeeming thing I can find in this late film I'm (unintentional?) Hilarion from our main man, Harry. He goes on-and-on about wanting to kill everyone and do them on the bottom, and even gets quite comic after a while. In fact, I'm almost tempted to think that it should be a kind of subtle homo-erotic for this movie, with all sorts of discussions and constant contests of Harry running with his dong. With all sincerity, the joker is more unknown in this movie, then the little chick showing some T-and-A (and some full-frontal for a good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a little amusing as a 1 hour clock, but I can only recommend this to those who want to say they have watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHO MANGLER. To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this trash ... A generous 3.5 / 10
