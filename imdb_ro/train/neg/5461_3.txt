Like all TV shows, there is a group of people who love the Twilight Zone so much that they basically evaluate each episode, such as the biggest EVER shows. While many of them are really wonderful classics, the truth is for every big episode, there were a few that were mediocre and at least one that stank. However, like the dead Trekkies, these area lovers insist that everyone is gold. In fact, this is what I originally had to review some individual episodes of a series of cultures instead of the movies they usually see. While this is not the worst episode ever produced, nor is it among the very bad, it is poor at any reasonable standard. A widow follows a long procession of civilian warrior soldiers who pass by at home. Finally, there is a very unexpected twist and there is not much enthusiasm or suspense here.
