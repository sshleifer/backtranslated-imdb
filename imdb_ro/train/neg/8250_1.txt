I ordered the movie in Korea because I was an extra in it and I was interested to see how it turned out. After seeing her, I can say I'm ashamed to have it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself, but for all the others who have been involved in this scandal of British comedy. From the beginning to the end, the movie is predictable, boring, boring, monotonous, and they doubt the point at which, on several occasions, I actually looked at the screen unknowingly. Until you see the movie, it's hard to conceive how romantic and comedic can be a romantic comedy. It's not just a bad story, it's a bad movie. In one scene, you can see a runner or a wizard that shows when to delete S.A. I will post details about this in the "Goofs" section. On the top, filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment?)
