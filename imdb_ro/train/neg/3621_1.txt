I hated this show when I was a kid. That was again on the day children show that the characters have accents, not just the usual, generic, general American dialect we are accustomed to. Jack Wild had a British accent, and Pufnstuf was south. As one of the others mentioned, however, I never understood what was the understanding with the witch who wanted the flute. That always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I did not try to get it! A commentary on Pufnstuf's similarity to McDonalds' 70s advertisements that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf has destroyed McDonalds. At McDonalds's popularity, TV show (or rather their creators) sought to hold McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds refused to broadcast the TV, the characters changed it slightly and passed it on their own. They even hired former employees of the McDonalds ad agency and voice actors to make TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Look for the Pufnstuf McDonaldland process and you'll find a lot of articles about it.
