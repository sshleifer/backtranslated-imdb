I entered this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of "My Favorite Martian". We had our daughter for 6 years with us. She wanted to go to the middle of the movie, which was good for both parents! The parts we saw were just occasionally humorous, most of them either too stupid or brutal. I was expecting this movie to appeal to children between the ages of 9 and 12 if that's it. It certainly is not suitable for younger children. From what I heard the original series was far superior and if you want to "relive the past" you will probably be disappointed.
