Come on Tina Fey, you can do better then. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Sure it was fun sometimes. He really laughs funny. But do not laugh enough to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At most, I recommend you rent it, but that's it. Baby Mama has some funny scenes, but it's predictable and fails to have the end of the heart he strives for. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did so well in this case and did good in this respect. But there is no better. Baby Mama had a strong distribution. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin added to the size of casts. Another pregnancy movie hit the world of cinema. After the wonderful Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks a lot in comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are funny, delightful and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. Ending Baby Mother was unpleasant and boring. Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and not trying to be. I recommend it, but do not expect to be totally hilarious. Wait for an average comedy that does not give the big emotional ending it tries to have. I give Baby Baby ... 4/10
