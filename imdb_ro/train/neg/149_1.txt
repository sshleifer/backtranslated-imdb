You know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I have seen for a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when he took over this role. The main role is played by (for me) a completely unknown and I would imagine that he immediately disappeared into the dark immediately after this turkey. Bruce Lee led the martial arts tax in the early 1970s and since then, battles have to be based on martial arts or at least brutal arts if they use street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to highlight the martial arts, however, even this can not hide the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a shot. An eight-year-old boy would separate him from this. <br /> <br /> Sorry, the only mystery we show here is how he did not win the golden raspberry for his year.
