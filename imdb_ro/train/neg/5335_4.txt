It was a time looooonnnggg since I saw this comedy and I forgot how idiotic it is. I would like that easily in two or three of Elvis Presley's most evil films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, an Indian rider who returns home to Arizona and the carriage where his family lives, and where his friends like to spend the night. His parents are interpreted by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance, comic or otherwise. The government has invested in family cattle, but they lack a bull. Elvis gets to sing only a few worthless songs and is pursued by a young man - crazy and his mother. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the surroundings practically dump down manure and do not make it much easier. The only thing that bothers me is that Elvis seems to really have fun in the movie. Hard to believe, since he was so upset that he was stuck making many mediocre films.
