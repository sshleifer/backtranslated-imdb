"The return of Chandu" is remarkable, if one can say, for casting Bela Lugosi as a hero rather than for a villain. Why he himself becomes a girl. The story as such involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti, trying to capture the last Princess Egyptian Nadji (delightful Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice as a means to revive the ancient ruler that resembles Nadji. Lugosi like Chandu, who has magical powers, tries to counteract the villains. Director Ray Taylor does everything he can, with limited resources and extensive material. King Kong's fans (1933) will recognize the huge doors that have been used to keep Kong in the void in several scenes. The actor is, for the most part, terrible. The actor who plays the high priest (for example, thinks Lucien Prival), for example, uses the inspired pronunciation of the acting coach, which was so common in the early talks. Less about the others, the better. It is a mystery why Lugosi has accepted parts in independent replicas at this stage of his career because he was still a banner at Universal at this time. Perhaps because in this case he came to play the hero and make the girl, who knows. As his career began to fall down in the late 1930s, this type of tariff would become the norm for Lugosi, rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
