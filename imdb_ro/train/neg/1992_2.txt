Do not let the name of this movie cheat you, in reality Jake Speed ​​character is probably the lazy hero of action ever known for the movie. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from bad madmen, which he is not often, he relaxes seriously. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but, in my opinion, a hero of action does not have to "cool down" whenever he gets the chance. In addition, unlike other bold heroes, who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you say you're sleeping a talent. However, this film is practically worthless, writing is under the hair, and the action, when there are some, is very lame. (The guns on the jeep were not bad, but that's what it is) So if you want to see a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - Has a hero that not only leaves it to sleep, but also to the public.
