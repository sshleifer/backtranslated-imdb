Dubbing / translating into this movie is absolutely hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this zombie movie, otherwise boring and derivative. I have not laughed so much in my life, as I have seen Zombies 3 (and I have seen some dubious in my life, believe me). Seriously, directors could re-create this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's so funny. But ... If we fall off the couch laughing at dubbing in a Fully zombie movie is not a cup of tea, then avoid it at all costs.
