Bob Clampett "Porky's Poor's Fish" is such a frightening cartoon and one or two beautiful moments. Established in Porky's Fish Shoppe, Porky's Poor Fish occupies an inconvenient area between a standard Porky black cartoon and one of the Merrie Melody songs that were popular at the time. Typically, in many of Porky's early cartoons, Porky is far from star, appearing only in a rather musical opening number and the climax of the movie. For the rest of the time, the star is a horrible cat, who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but it gets more than it was negotiated. Unfortunately, the audience becomes much less than they negotiated. As is sometimes the case in the live-life series, the spotlight is thrown on punning signs that could have worked as well in an uninvited environment. The lashes are rare and, while the cartoons are almost saved by Clampett's energetic direction, it is very little to recommend "Poor Pigs" over any other cartoon below Porky.
