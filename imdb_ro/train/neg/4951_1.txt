I commented on this when he first debuted and gave me a "thumbs in mid" review, noting that I would give him the benefit of the doubt beyond the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to now in June 2006. And as a Batman fan of life, I can say without hesitation: this show is stupid. Everything's wrong with him. All. Starting from unwanted animation and design, stories are ridiculously complicated and without any development of the character or apparent interest by the writers of this dance to give any substance to any story. For the sake of God. Is it just me, or is the joker in EUROPE EPISODE? Is Gotham the justice system of a revolving door? Or, again, it is only a total lack of interest for writers to put any effort into the other villains (see "no character development" above). And to make things worse, each Joker story is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gasses people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets to gas the whole city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> It was an episode I saw was not a story of Joker. The title missed me, but the villain was that angry Cluemaster ... the "Think Thank Thunk" episode with the test show. This was the worst Batman story I've seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I got Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I feel about this show because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fervor". Thank you for Timm / Dini / etc. it was Bat-Entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days. So good things that I should have known this could not have been, unfortunately, always.
