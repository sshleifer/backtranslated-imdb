CAREFUL. This movie is such a mess. It's a catastrophe. Do not waste time with this. I warned you! The actor, the story, the dialogue, the music ... basically everything is so high, it is absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw up (if the dialogue / act / story did not do that, everyone was shot). You will feel like watching a comedy. The problem is that parties that are supposed to be fun are not even funny. Action, story, cinema, you can feel everything trying too much WAAAAY - but never succeeds. Basically, every shot is quantity, but what ?! This movie only feels a student movie. No wonder they shot this thing in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this movie on the film. If you are slightly amused or poor acting, writing, editing, directing, clich√©, everything that is forced in front of you, oh and mentioned the lean action? (Well, actually, it's not the actor's fault - it's director!), then I think you'll love this movie. I have to look at this for a class. I would have stopped immediately if I could. If you can not say yet, we've hidden this movie. I made myself want to throw myself back and come back in time ... at least I did not have to pay for this garbage. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy at Jurassic Park / Independence Day, he's in this movie, but he's definitely gone down then - accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe.
