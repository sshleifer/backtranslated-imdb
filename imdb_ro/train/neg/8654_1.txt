The film was completely deceptive and the bonus material confirmed the impression that Joeseph Conrad's heart was blowing, the river was replaced by a road and the boat became a jeep and Walter Kurtz was Osama. <br /> </ p> <p> The complaints made on the outside of the DVD box were obvious scams to take this fabulous death of a journalist and present it as a deed while some Muslim portions sustaining September 11 attacks for treatment US Muslims around the world. I alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from the "Documentary" section and placed in the battlefield for war for quasi-fictitious accounts of real events.
