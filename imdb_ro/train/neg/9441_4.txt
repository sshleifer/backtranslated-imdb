this movie was banned in England? Why? Tom Savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulcci and others have done much worse before and have continued since then ... this movie has all the basics of a decent horror from 1970's or early 80's film. the benevolent girls (who can not act to save their lives, by the way), a thunderstorm with a terrible lightning, a torrential rain, a scabbard, a mad brother wandering around the family and, in fact, a pretty good twist at the end. but forbidden? Seriously. when the English Parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed from their collective colleagues as backward and cautious as they were in fact the fools. There may be two minutes of the total time of the screen dedicated to violence and gore (which was much underdeveloped). it was nudity, but no sex, although allusions to sex were obviously made. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned. I would like to see what could have been done if film producers had a decent budget to work with them. Nowadays, the movie is fun, but the lack of image and sound quality leads to a decrease in the final result. <br /> <br /> banned ... what a joke ...
