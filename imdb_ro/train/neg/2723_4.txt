Claire Denis's films seem to fall into one of the two categories: violence and bloody, quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" certainly falls into the first category, but it's not as terrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil". Now, since I've seen "Chocolat" I made a point to see every new movie made by Denis. And I was always disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has not yet made such a personal and moving film as her first. <br /> <br /> You have a lot of ordinary Denis: an old but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the film just to show her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample carving and a pair of beautiful clothes; the black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin, and a Lithuanian or Russian girl. The character of Michel Subor was quite interesting, but the room stayed so long that I was annoyed by that prelude of my hair hanging on my forehead and relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think she managed to He finally cuts it off. <br /> <br /> There were certainly actions - huge crimes, the search for a son by a man - and maybe it was a plot, but a view was not enough to find it and two views are, I'm afraid , out of the question. First, the score was offensive and tiring (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the seasons changed too suddenly, leaving you even more confused about what was happening. There were some nice pictures, and if you liked "Evening Friday", with photos of heavyweight curtains and bed sheets, you can appreciate the L'Intrus esthetics. Otherwise, make sure you are clear. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie in French and I may have missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely reaches more than five pages, double spaced and wide margins. In "Chocolat" silence is sublime; in L'Intrus, it's just boring.
