Maaan, where I start with this terrible movie. Bad bad story bad say. I do not know what the director thought when he made this movie. Namaste London was a nice movie to be honest ... even if the soundtrack was good. But in this one, well ... for a movie that should be a musical ... the songs are so bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /> <br /> Given the two great actors, the director should have done much better. Even if the first half is failed, the last 30 minutes of the movie are OK. The performances of Salman and Ajay save the film from a total disaster. Look if you have nothing better to do. The last good Bollywood movie I watched (and I look at a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
