Allow me to say otherwise: balls. Or, how about bollo * ks. This is really awful, more embarrassing than those who try to forgive. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard. This movie is so flawless even she is struggling to look good. Normally, she is the perfect professional, yet I swear that in her eyes there were signs of astonishment and despair. The only thing that could have saved this move was the idea of ​​director (Chris Walken) turning the film into a secret document about the actors. Unfortunately, that theme has not been explored to the full potential. Too little, too late. Zeta Jones was made of wood, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stay in acting. The two ex-Buffy talents have had different experiences - Green, with mysterious despair, and Balfour under-used. Well done to Julia for this not to be the worst movie ever made.
