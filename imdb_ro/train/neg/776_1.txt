I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather took the free video from the mall. I remember he really suffocated. The plot did not make sense. I hated the fox that became Casper's girlfriend. He was so stupid! Casper shakes his head if he does not find a friend. So what? Move on! The only good part I do not want to noise was when the fox was shot and died at the end. I laughed at my head because this cartoon suffocated so much. The bad news is the rebirth of foxes and becomes a ghost. I wish I'd been dead. I think I even gave the video about it because I hated it. No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall. If you have a baby, do not let them look at it. They'll probably agree with me that sucks.
