This is definitely one of Weirder 70's films and is most remarkable for launching a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It's also remarkable for the little touches of madness across the movie, especially when the first half of dark color is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who is fighting for a while in a canoe, then leaves, never seen again). Although painfully dated now, I'm still a scary fun movie to show them to the kids, and anyone who enjoys a Bigfoot lore or a 70-year-old hill culture is bound to get a shot of it. My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he can head his head through a door (!?) And the narrator explains that he went unconsciously from "shock". Uh, I'd say breaking a door with your head is more likely why it was unconscious, but anything. 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you love the Americans bad.
