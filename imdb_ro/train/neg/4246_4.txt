Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a Jewish mother who wants her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate Greta Garbo in one go and show the two before asking for Estelle. Maybe it would have been called "Bancroft Talks" because the actress is attacking this uncertain comedy / dramatic / sentimental material during her lifetime. Sidney Lumet, hot or cold, can not get a consistent rhythm, and Bancroft's constant conviction is not diminished at all by the filmmaker - he keeps it well: cute, eyes full of eyes and fists. Estelle becomes a love on this scenario (not that the thin-conceived plot has much going next). Silver and co-stars, Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks, get very little, but they support the star, and everyone is hammering. * 1/2 from ****
