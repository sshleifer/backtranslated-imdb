I also saw this incredibly bad "anime" play at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to watch this, do this with a big audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can get a glimpse of it. <br /> <br /> I found the hilarious dialogue, sitting in my mind is the introduction of the Cremator. The animation is awful. It is poorly designed and executed badly. It might have been a good idea that the manufacturers hired at least one person who was not blind. There is nothing else to say, this film is a failure at all levels.
