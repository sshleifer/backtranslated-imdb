This movie was not that bad compared to the first two successes to the original. It's directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday's 13th fame. The actor is really very bad, but gore and special effects make it interesting. This is one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (the effect of the artist for the film), its effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you seeing a bad movie just to find out how crazy they are going to get. The movie is not really so horrible, but there is an EXTREMELY-OBSCOLE-MUNCHING scene in the middle that involves a toy worm (what !?!) Mickey Rooney makes an apparent guest about which he probably was not too enthusiastic about, but did he need the money at that time, eventually? If you liked the fourth installment (my favorite of all 5), you probably like that. I liked it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
