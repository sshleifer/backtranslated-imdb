This movie was terrible. We had a very difficult time to follow this up to the end. I did not get the point of the movie. What was the purpose of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad and the story was uninspired. The two main characters in the film were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There is no chemistry among the tower members. I do not know that, but I suspect most of the actors were the first time. The film could easily be cut at about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This shows how many unnecessary scenes were in the movie. I'd rather have a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want the two hours back! If you want to watch a good, funny, family friendly movie and made by a bunch of Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.
