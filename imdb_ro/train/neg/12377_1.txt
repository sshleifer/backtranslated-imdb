Just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they're stupid. If your child likes this movie, you'd better test him. I am always amazed at how many people can be involved in something that proves so bad. This "film" is a showcase for digital witchcraft and nothing else. Writing is horrible. I do not remember when I heard such a stupid dialogue. The songs are beyond misfortune. The act is sub-par, but the actors have not been much. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is nasty as a sin. The worst thing is the obvious of all. It's like the writers have gone out of their way to make everything as stupid as possible. Big children's movies are mean, wise, and full of philosophers like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past. But in the wake of the aggression of the Americans, they find it more like finding Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie Chocolate Factory and chocolate and trash that crosses the eyes like the Hood Red Riding Hood.
