Istanbul is one of those expatriated films that Errol Flynn has been doing in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and no longer have problems with the IRS. It's a remake of Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner's film a decade ago. Unlike this studio, Istanbul has the advantage of that great cinema at the very sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, exponentially aging in front of the room in every movie, was too old to play these kinds of action / adventure. His scenes with Cornell Borchers are not really convincing. As far as Cornell is concerned, she interprets Errol's ex-boyfriend, who now has amnesia through the trauma of saving a fire. They both do not remember Errol and are now married to Torin Thatcher. But Errol has some ugly people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds that came into his possession. You have to fix them. The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and singing the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a jazz pianist, he only thinks of him as a singer. In fact, he was the first pianist, singing was a later idea. Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for those who are fans of that type of film.
