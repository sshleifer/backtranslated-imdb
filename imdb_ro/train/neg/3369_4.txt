Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. When I first heard about the remake of Robert Wise's "The Haunting," in 1963, I'm afraid it would be ruined by a lot of summer-effect visual effects. But, deep down, I had faith. Of course, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and the company will not destroy a movie, who is the original was a fantastic and frightening film that grasped the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now? My fears have manifested ... a promising movie went wrong. Yes, the production design of Eugenio Zannetti is fallible; the movie is greatly photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never make a mistake. But the script tries to test the good actors, trying to give them a kind of dialogue that is just in the movies. Finally, the wonderful Lili Taylor is always the only performer to escape with a little dignity ... and that's just barely. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, to feel terrible fear of the unknown. No, we have some visual effects to show what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? As it is wonderful, as it is ... visual effects are triggered as a kind of stupidity. And the climax is a phantasmogoric misery ... but things went very bad long before that. <br /> <br /> Everything in Haunting is overwhelmed and overstretched. I'm afraid there are no real or debilitating emotions in this old monstrosity of the haunted house ... only groans. Check the original instead. <br /> <br />
