"The wild tigers I know." It will only be displayed in large cities, to be sure. It's one of those SO arts movies, it has no meaning what's so much except the director! I LOVE those! And all those alternative / artistic people try DESPERAT to find "metaphors" in what Horseshit EVIDENT is. There was no plot, no story, no moral, no timeline, no fun or no touch. For me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with each other, and they were all for "show" to show how "art" and "visual" they would could get it. It was an ATTEMPT to another teenage film, but it missed the mark on every possible human level. Then the credits are rolling! We were waiting for SENSE to do it! I waited for the "good side". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "house art" films. This will NOT be among them. You will be very angry at yourself that you pay to see this movie, much less ever buying it on DVD.
