This sport has a nice and profound interpretation, but for a thriller you have to offer more than just name actors and talk. The first third of this film was just talking and talking more. Most of it was a bunch of women who were fighting each other. <br /> <br /> The top five actors listed here are women so check that it's really a "chicken blow" and something else. This is probably happening on the Lifetime network. It was a quick scene of murder and then more talk. Halfway, they lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field showed about 15 years here.
