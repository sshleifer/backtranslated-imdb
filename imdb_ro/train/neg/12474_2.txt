I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I loved the film so much - even "ruthless" - that I decided to see the whole movie series "Deathstalker". I bought him and II and I sat down for a laugh. Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was fun at all levels and when the credits rolled, I was embarrassed and regretted that I bought it! Too much ugly and nudity. I think that either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production, or MST3K really edited much, because I expected something similar, that is, stupid, carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2", as I'm going back tomorrow. Now I will probably give up this DVD, because I can not return it and nobody wants it - including myself! So do not bother with this. Even nudity (a lot of it, BTW) is uninspiring and icky.
