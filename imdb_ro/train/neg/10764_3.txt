I'll give writer / director William Gove credit for finding someone to fund this badly-designed "thriller." A good argument for not loosing money to HBO subscribers, let alone buy DVDs based on the cover and blurbs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a Richard Grieco game do not add anything significant to their rehearsals, though the art direction is not half bad. The dialogue will leave you grimacing wonderfully to his mind; this is the story at worst. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothing. Some attractive and often nude women spice up their boredom, but it's certainly a film best considered a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who saw this. Good for the late night, viewing only with zoning. You were warned.
