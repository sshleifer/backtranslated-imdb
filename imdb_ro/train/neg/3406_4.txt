The space camp, who had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. Steaua makes an act of mockery, Lea Thomson being transformed into a side-by-side, when she was asked more than her innocent smile, usually with wide eyes, probably to mask her real trials. The movie is sometimes hilarious when it starts asking too much. A boy holds a million dollar robot in his closet, which breaks when too many orders are given by the hordes of colleagues in the home. This unwavering machine, "Jinx," is an important player in the ridiculous premise of the movie, which appears to be part of the Air Circle Short Circuit, part 2001. I'm not gonna bother you with that, you just say you can not laugh when you're confronted with it. After I said all this, it's nice to watch, in a SeaQuest mode, Saved through the bell. Romanticism and technology, beware, are just as incredible as the others. Also, if you're weird for eighties, it's unique for the funny performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie of Doom Temple) and obviously Lea Thompson. Joaquin Phoenix also puts a turn like a kind of wannabe Goonie who is friends with Jinx. Do not get close to this movie unless you're a fan of garbage.
