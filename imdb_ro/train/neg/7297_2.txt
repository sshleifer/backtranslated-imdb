From the opening dialogue and the scenes I knew I knew I was drunk. He did not want to look, but he could not go back. If it were not the candy with the best eyes of this movie, I would have given a star. The fact that the interaction between characters and the behavior of relationships has been reached so far, added by the bad direction and the horrible story, makes this film a nothing but a disaster with a low budget. Money is certainly not a must to make a good movie. But this movie fails so great that there was no chance of returning. If you were stuck in the woods, your child's best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stuck in a weird place, what would you do? A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Have sex with your friend of friends. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your pains to include the shaving of your feet. D.) Bash into the head of childhood best friend and crush with a shovel. E.) All of the above. According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so busy. In fact, all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throw this movie into the local store store. Stay away. Stay away.
