However, another film about a group of less intelligent individuals on a journey on the road who are wandering off their initial travel route for either a short duration or, in this case, to visit a show attraction side. The results, as they expected, are not good at all, because this side show is home to a bunch of crazy, red-haired residents who have escaped prisoners a few years ago. The father, who is apparently a professional photographer, just has to stop and take pictures of the place, just to find that he is still inhabited. Different family members are wandering to see the various attractions just to be scared. Thinking they did it safely on their way, van tires explode (surprise!), Leaving them to seek refuge and accommodation in the small town, which we find inhabited only by strangers (surprise!). <br /> <The film unfolds as expected, the family being watched and killed by strangers. There are some beats back to the family side, but they are probably among the worst scenes in the movie because they are badly executed. There is nothing original here except if you count the totally inadequate soundtrack that plays in certain scenes that completely ruin the atmosphere and the mood of the movie. The actor is just as bad as the one I've seen for a long time (it's bad enough when your cast is not driven by Camp Blood distribution). The special effects are stupid and the ending made me want my TV set. Still, despite all the negatives I enjoyed this movie, it certainly has a "so bad" vibration. even pleasant fun as soon as I went through the ridiculous clichÃ© plot, with terrible effects and great effects. Although the end left me to feel cheated and upset, especially because the movie is not so good for the beginning, and the end makes the whole movie useless. Bottom line, I can list countless movies that, if you've seen them, you've seen this. The difference is that most movies are better. not remotely frightening. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
