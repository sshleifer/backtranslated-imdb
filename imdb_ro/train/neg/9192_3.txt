I found this movie in the "horror" section of my video store. This seems to make sense because most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's "Dead" trilogy to "28 days later". However, when watching her, you can quickly see what this movie really is. It's actually a musical video that goes progressively faster and is getting worse and worse. There is no horror here. Just a few scene scenarios that began to develop soon, because they passed ... and the last ... and the last ... and soon you will have the feeling that you could accidentally play DVD back in 3 minutes, but no, that's how they made the movie. It's a shame. I think someone could find a better use for the $ 7 million in the movie industry than to do that a crust. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cold, but once again they used and became boring, because it was the same stunt game over and over every time, with just another character. ROYALLY annoying is splicing on images of the arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. Why did they put it here? Oh, that's right, it's not a movie, it's a musical video, and it's a poor one. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: a lot of violence / gore and profanity
