Generally, I like to see Burt Lancaster's films - especially when you need to let him out with an impressive screen presence, as in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest power, his magnetism, was occasionally his greatest weakness, as he, seldom, never suffered subtlety anyway. And this lack of subtlety hinders Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She should be intelligent, but it does not seem to be when Lancaster's fur is thrown around the screen! In addition, the story is probably one of the most spectacular movies I've ever seen and it's too obvious that it's a movie based on a piece. It seems he was more filmed in a sound scene instead of in the great open West West as it should have been. Overall, a highly overrated film.
