The bridegroom dies on the altar, and their bodies disappear. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to know why and how this happens and can not prevent this. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this because he extracts the spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep it alive. Continue to carry with me. Finally, the authorities realize that someone has to instigate deaths and disappearances, but of course they can not tell the unlikely reason. Ignore ridiculous pseudoscience and move on ... If you can go through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated by Lugosi by whipping the lab assistant for not respecting one of the brides he killed, explaining that he is sleeping in a coffin more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parody of real horror movies (the genre with budgets and parcels). Anyhoo, a female journalist, follows his nose to blame (and, remarkably, the seedy policeman is not where to be seen!), And fun begins really. Cinema and acting are all right. There are a lot of well dressed, very good people in this movie. The direction is correct, and the script is slightly better than the worthwhile material. However, this film fails to support the interest of b-film fans, except the most powerful. The best thing about this ... It finally ends, but not quite soon.
