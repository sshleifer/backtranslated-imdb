I do not know what they thought. Actually, I mean anyone who is connected from the destruction to this disaster. I've seen movies so bad, I've seen movies so bad, and then I did that. someone who wrote the script managed to put what might be the most inappropriate dialogue over writing on the screen. there is nothing good about this movie, either technically or in any other way. anyone allowed it to be done and then it should have been fired immediately. there are some well-known names in this movie. Normally, we hesitate to use the word movie.it more like a collection of random scenes that have nothing to do with another and make less than a sense.anyway, I fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this thing. It was very cheap, and I still broke it.even if I found this movie for free, I would have been still broken off.this is an absoluter 0/10
