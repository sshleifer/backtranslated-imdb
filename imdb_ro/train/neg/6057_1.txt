Can anyone stop John Carpenter from the continuous and deliberate destruction of his reputation? How stupid can you be? It seems that this man has lost all respect for himself. This episode seems to have been made by a film student, not even worth talking about what was bad because it was just a borefest, directed by someone who has no talent as a director or without any motivation ... Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please immediately withdraw yourself with a rest of self-esteem and do not spill garbage like this in a bad tradition from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Be drunk instead.
