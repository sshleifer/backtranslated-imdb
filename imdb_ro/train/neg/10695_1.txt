... Okay, I read about this movie somewhere on the internet, and many criticized how bad and sucking this movie was. And I could not agree with that. Then, afterwards, I saw this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it and then sold this movie to TV. Luckily, I spent my money on these pieces of nonsense. My sleep was sacrificed for this film and it soon turned out that this film could not make me happy. So I can not judge the way the movie was made, but anyway ... it's still shit. As for those who liked this movie, I would have apologized for filming this movie and saying how sucking this movie. I do not know what you think about this movie?
