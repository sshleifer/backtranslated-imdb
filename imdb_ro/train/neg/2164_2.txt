I thought a movie that boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews would be worth seeing. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Some pretentious nonsense from start to finish, both with O'Toole and York, outnumbering wildly. I've seen it twice, and I still have no idea what this is all about. I have the feeling that O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle that has a drinking problem and likes to play kid's games with his sister (York). He barks too. But besides, your assumption is just as good as mine. The film has no ransoming feature. I can only assume that the distributor and the director have been blackmailed in doing so grossly, without imagination. Clearly a waste of time by a talented distributor and director. Ridiculous.
