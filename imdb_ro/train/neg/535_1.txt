Some of these viewers' comments are just ridiculous. Is not it painful to look at your significant one? I apologize to my friend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and terribly strange. Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were inappropriate for this, especially with Vanessa making that American accent ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same weird girl she lived in my so-called life. It must not be scattered in any way. The girl, you find a new way of claiming that you are crying! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming parts of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes, and I swore to God, stretched out of the screen and fooled me. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also wonderful in the two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> That is, it was a well-filmed movie, it was very nice, the settings were interesting, offering relief for the intense boredom that I felt. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a song composed of "The greatest actresses of our time" is so smart. Sure has had more than a few visible editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a big robbery. I'm glad he died. But because I felt bad about Lila, Ann's girlfriend - especially because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD job, Movie Night. You did not have fun or even provoke yourself. I hope the book would be better, so it did not waste much time on people. 3/10
