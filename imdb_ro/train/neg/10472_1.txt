I should have known I had problems with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words can not describe, nor do justice to how terrible this movie was. But please allow me to try to describe it: horrible action, terrible dialogue, horn situations and, by doing so, all that you feel about being forced to feed the beliefs and props of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to try to show Hollywood that a movie can be fun and have a deep, religious message attached to it. They did not fail. This was clearly the worst movie I've seen for a long time.
