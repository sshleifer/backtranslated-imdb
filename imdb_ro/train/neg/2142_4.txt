If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is stuck to the TV when she looks at her. As an adult, I can not resist !! It's all for follow-up ... when they have a decent story. But this is far from standard. Please forgive me for weakening what is finally a child's movie, but when you have to stay almost every day when your children love so much, you will understand why. My daughter will watch this movie again the same day if we leave it. I gave this movie 4 out of 10 simply because it keeps my youngest fun.
