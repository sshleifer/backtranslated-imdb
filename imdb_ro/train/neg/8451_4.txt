I have to admit I liked the first half of the Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, the pain and the revenge were interesting and they were moving. A superior Hollywood movie. But ... Nobody mentioned this until now (at least in the last 20 comments) when he came to the courtroom scenes, and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends , felt cheated. This movie has insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning Spores! Why has anyone accepted their false alibi, which the priest assisted? If these two guys were with him, why should not he say that during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a member of the jury, would you believe? Is it wise to give up the cause of the killers? I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very poor, and that's what makes me angry. This movie had great potential. 4/10
