This was my first film and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it, as Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, told me, and it was a Theo's movie, which I heard a lot about. The opening was promising, a long shot on a jeep of soldiers along the border between Albania and Greece. O.K! but that was all. There is nothing left. The film had big holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main plot in the story is revealed to the journalist by the old man. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue, killing spectators' action and patience, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except for this old storytelling story. All that is supposed to be shown by action was simply told by the old lady's room. In a moment, the TV equipment headed for the bar. The corner is back and winter starts immediately! Probably, shot on different days, continuity has passed. A lot of problems with the story have gone from absurd to irrational, never sticking to style, making the viewer ask questions that have never been answered. Poor Mastroianni, given a role that had no integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many of the Greeks or Albanians or the Balkans would agree, the films showed a historical, ethnic or political incapacity only to make a movie about "humanity" like a red in another review. Several things to say, but we do not have time to lose on a poor film that was not a movie at all, but a person's slides impressed the movie and paid for money from the state.
