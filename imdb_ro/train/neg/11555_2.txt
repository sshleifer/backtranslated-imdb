A great movie shooting - too bad were producers and not part of the script. The basic summary of the plot - the man with redheaded fetish invites those women to be in his apartment just to enter some kind of strange coma and continues to lead them to varying degrees of success. Only the cutting crew behind the scenes should have believed the movie was as good as me and cut off my anger from the movie. Nothing is flowing, you lose that redhead is with him at the time (did not do this earlier) and most of the time it seems that the shooting man has passed and resumed shooting when he wakes up. Not that I can blame him for having passed 2-3 times, and I had to come back and take it back to try and recover what little plot there is. WARNING when you see the END DO NOT try to connect it with something that happens before - you will only get an aneurysm. It is not worth the time, effort or God to forbid money. Just the reason to get a 2 instead of 1 - the slim chance that hacking occurred between the release of the movie and the horrible version I watched.
