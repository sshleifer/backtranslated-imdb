Do not let it trick you - it was a funny movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. The story prepares you nicely for an end that never comes. Even worse, the setting is NEVER explained. You will let the theater ask yourself, "Is that right?" I appreciate it 2 just because there were a few moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did a job as good as expected in his role, but he worked very little. There are strange and exciting strange things all over, which have nothing to do with the movie. Let him go out on the video before you waste your money.
