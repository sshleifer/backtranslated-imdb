A vicious mummy about men, women, and the sex between them. It is not like that? In the beginning, the mummy randomly asks the spectator: "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy" 37 times as you blink the images of the half-naked young men. Later, fashion boys have said modt girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or repeat ahead) through the mummy whining, the shorts are not bad in itself. I found some of them rather funny. My personal preference is where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed. This is a binary, bizarre film.
