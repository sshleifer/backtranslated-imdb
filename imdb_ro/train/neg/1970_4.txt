Watching this movie for action is rather a waste of time, as ship figures act better than humans. It is a pity that Anthony Quinn could not convince anyone else to let him direct other films after this turkey. But it is full of fun, because Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene displays an unconvincing French accent, and the rest of the great book names in the comic book.
