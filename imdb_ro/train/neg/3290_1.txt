This movie sucks! They took some of my childhood and raped her in an apartment! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and keep the "Dukes" DVDs and cry in a corner. The tower was terrible! It was not "Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg bad? When was Rosco a tough guy? They have never been! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse steal the pot? Never did! Now do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a small chiba, but there was no place in this movie! The only good thing about this movie was the trailers before the film and the final credits. It was a waste of money and air. Avoid at any cost !!!!!!!!
