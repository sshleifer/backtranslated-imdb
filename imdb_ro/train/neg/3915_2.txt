This film is not just scribble and stupid, but it's simply disagreeable. A beautiful novel is very badly interpreted in this film. There have been many changes in the story, perhaps to rationalize the time. But what results is simply confusing. The act can not go beyond the scenario that eliminates the characters' motives for their behavior. In addition, English conversion does not work when everyone refers to Esteban patriarch as ESteban. Horrible. Please please read the gorgeous novel in Spanish if possible. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what might be a wonderful experience.
