This is one of those movies I'd like to be in the bar. The movie is quite boring. What story there is very thin and you have to guess a lot about it. The film employs prominent camera techniques that seem to be designed to cause migraines and makes it look like a student movie. Did I say it was already boring? If all the characters died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not have cared for less because I did not have any emotional attachment to any of them. There are about 4 minutes good in this movie, but it was about that. This is the first time I ever thought I came out of a cinema during a show, but I thought it had to improve. I was wrong. The movie you could threaten with naughty kids.
