Do you like to get up? Then stay away from this ... During the early round, there are actually comics, but if they do not have nice qualities, they have a chance of snow. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I hurt as much as comedians throw away when I see who leaves the judges crooked. 1 in my 4th rank went further than the preliminary. Half of the finalists gave me a laugh. Several of them have taken their material elsewhere, which judges do not seem to have problems with. It's much more fun than a lot of what's on TV, but incredibly hard to watch without thinking about what it could have been. If the producers change the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticisms would be invalidated. Maybe an idea?
