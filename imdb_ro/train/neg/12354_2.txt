Of course I did not look at "GI Jane" of choice. I was more or less forced to see this movie around my ex-girlfriend's house. GI Jane is losing his credibility immediately, trying to convince the viewer that this is a real scenario, which of course is not. The result is that the story becomes automatically bound to constraints, restricting the amount of humor (which does not exist) or fun scenes and soon becomes too serious. Therefore, the movie becomes extremely boring and predictable. "GI Jane" does not succeed if other action movies succeed, mainly because movies such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, but never proclaim otherwise. They are escapism and therefore are fun. "GI Jane" tries to be real and fails. This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with a very credible story, an unimaginable action, and the only reason I give him 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work.
