This movie is a big stack of steaming. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why someone felt that the Garland / Mason version had to be redrawn, and why Striesand would have been a first choice to play. I have no idea why our people (homosexual Americans) tend to look at Stries and as a treasure. At least in my opinion she has reached a professional point of view with Funny Girl, and with Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do a favor and rent the classic Judy, or even the original one (a wonderful movie in itself), but please, please, skip this stinkpot!
