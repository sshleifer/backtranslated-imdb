After seeing the previews, I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over the fast and furious series. So I've already expected to have a missing story, but at least this time it will not be loaded with a bunch of crazy civic boot boxes. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story than ever, this movie is for you. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm fine - I would not take baseball bats to nuts as what others have said). Not only was the story inexistent, but the action was stupid. I think the director thought he could throw a bunch of exotic females and cars and then name a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nose button, and his Lamborghini goes down and flies to a McLaren SLR to win. And after Eddy Griffin was put in a fight with one of his "girls" (in this case an Imus comment would work), the girl asks to withdraw and get out of PLANE and of course I do it in the middle of the desert . After this wonderful scene, I could not take it anymore. So I saw only half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I've ever left. After that, I had to stop for some beverages to kill all the corrupted brain cells. I gave it because 0 is not an option. It would be better to go to the local show and stop at a common road on the way home. I will keep all the spectators in my prayers.
