I suppose that any novel that is as much as a madman like Moby Dick would not find too much favor with the audiences of the Depression era who had enough trouble. But any resemblance to the classic novel by Herman Melville is a pure coincidence. In fact, half the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not that much has been preserved for the movie. First we meet Ahab Creely (a surname and a brother) as a happy soul who has two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, the daughter of Fatherple Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab in a top show. Barrymore did not quite master the soundtrack and kicked out all the silent-era histrionics plus a scenic voice that would shake the goats of any cinema from which the film was played. We see that Ahab loses his foot for the great whale, Moby Dick, we have to say that the amputation scene was pretty scary. Of course that was before the Code. However, I'm sure 1930 viewers have overturned. After that, the story of Ahab's whale search he believes made harmless to Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not Melville's motivation, in fact, in Moby Dick there are no female characters as he wrote them. One of the things Melville did was to invest the crew of Ahab Pequod's ship with personalities. Other than the Queequeg cannibal harpooner, the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could also be Smith and Jones. I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
