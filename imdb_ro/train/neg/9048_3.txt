Originally broadcast as an ABC movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent students who are being led into a detention camp in a small southern city. They are not allowed to make phone calls and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation, which leads to a very disturbing conclusion. The TV version was (for its time) bleak. No nudity and beatings were pretty nice, but the general feeling of weakness was one. The unrated version is even more serious - there is abundant nudity, violence is extreme and, in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see an angry prisoner forced to strip, while a lesbian guard "uses it". Yuck! There is nothing wrong with exploitative movies, but it just goes over the threshold. You have the feeling that movie producers enjoy the fact that these poor women are tortured and degraded - all this is being pushed in front of you as you should enjoy it. Unnecessary termination of slander does not help me. Give it a 3, because the action is good - but that makes the movie harder to watch. A sick, restless film. Not recommended.
