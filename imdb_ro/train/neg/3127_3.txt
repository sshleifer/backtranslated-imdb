An archeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally collides on a 40-foot old mummy, well-kept underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this secret and call a Jewish translator to help find history. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in those days. In order to save his son from a devastating flood, which was supposed to kill everything, he mummies his son, burying him with more servants for centuries - intending to awaken him for years. At present, fallen angels are still on the earth, and the mummy is resurrected, and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the movie is slow, having a lot of biblical fools and a few battles of war. The mummy is in decent search, but it is not presented nearly enough. He should have had more to do with it, but he dragged a lot like this ... eh. Not disturb.
