movie goers - avoid watching this movie. if you are a weak heart, you could commit suicide. if you're short-tempered, you'd want to kill the lead singer of the movie. Although he has no talent in acting, he is the hero of mass for all rickshaw players, rickshaw drivers, cool, evil, and immature and ignorant learners. he proves - you do not need any talent or knowledge to be successful. He is the best paid actor in India. This shows the taste of the movie that goes public in India. 90% of those who have watched the film in tamil nadu are surely drawn to his nonsense movies.
