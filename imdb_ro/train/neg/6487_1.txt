Well, thank you very much Disney for destroying the pleasant memories I used to have my favorite movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember to see. So now that I am 16 years old and I feel pretty masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. So I managed to poison all my memories in the original movie with this bad excuse for a movie. This film takes everything that the original made and destroys it until the last detail. In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and I'm going to show her all in the ocean ... THE BROADWAY STATION! After the musical number ends, in a few minutes, Morgana looks out into the sea and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. Thus, he gives up without a fight. Eric sits there, panting, though Ariel shows how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should not be near the sea until Morgana is caught. Well, nothing is happening. Eric is a total of wuss. He never succeeds in doing anything. Ariel is doing something. Melody manages to deceive things. In addition, animation is a new weak point for Disney. Computerized graphics revolve against the background. One more opportunity to develop the character is scattered. The song bites. Look, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure that even young children will be bored from their skull with this, because nothing really interesting happens. They do not want to play the songs. If you can make a copy of this, throw it into the ocean and hope no one ever finds it. Ever.
