I know you've read this before, countless other movies no doubt if you read the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the worst absolute movie we could track. no doubt the really bad ones are not even available to buy or watch on television, but even so I feel it is fair to say that they are not just tenants who have chosen me badly. I saw two-thirds of the 100 bottom-ranked movies on imdb, and I tick the remaining ones with every chance. most of them are head and shoulders above this ... I practice in absolute monotony. I like to rate really bad movies (as in those who are not humorous, even in how bad they are) how many people you have to watch in order to do everything possible. if you can track it yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch it with a single friend ... it's bad, but it could be worse. It took us 5 of us to go all the way through the voodoo academy. and even the funny moments to watch bad movies (see for example, three times in this case if I'm not mistaken) could take my dry mouth into my mouth. I watched them, but I would have forced 4 friends to look at me to achieve this goal. I hope to pray and see that the directors have cut ... to believe there might be a 20-foot version of the big pockets with eyebrows, with baby oil nozzles that rub their torso, just scare the fuck '. so much of the film centers around this. I applaud david decoteau to manage this movie in two days on a short budget, just as I applaud him to persuade people to pay him to do what is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it's not a good movie. the original horror store was shot in the same amount of time for a comparitive amount of money (given inflation) and it was a total jewel. is not an excuse for how bad this child is. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> plot holes or get to know all the characters of the hero. , the stimulation of the movie ... is crazy ... nothing ... it's interesting for the time they took off for the pectoral massage. no matter what alignment or sex ... friction can not support this time on the screen. acting is cheese ... but not too amateur ... I have seen much worse in better movies ... but somehow is the semi-competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a movie that even routing. Hire it if, like me, you have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you follow it with a group of people who are ready to work to get through it. this is not ha ha ha established affair set up. is an endurance test that you probably want to ignore. I'm sure it's worse ... but I would not be surprised if he had the name decapitating on him.
