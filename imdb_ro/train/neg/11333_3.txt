This movie is stupid. Even though directors claim to be part of that mastery, it's still a very dire, very bad debut. The subject itself is very interesting and accepts the bad actions because they are amateur and have never acted before, but the worst thing about this film is the very unperturbed and naive dialogues and directions. There is no moment in that movie. I felt that the directors were so out to make this film (it's their first feature) that they never really wondered what story they were going to tell. I met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions, and he's a good and thoughtful guy, but that does not make him director. I think "American history X" is full of cliches, but manages to carry a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of cliches, does not say anything new or provocative and (it's a sad thing about this movie) is far from any Sheep! -Reality. If you want to see strange but great German movies, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** out of ten thanks to the subject and the photo
