Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (except SRK, of course, even if he fails to save the film), and not much sense. The director makes everything very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe because he's trying to make everything look very surreal and yet credible. Well, none leads. Even if you have a few hours to lose, do not look at this movie, please! (Saying this for your own well-being!) Keep searching, you'll find something else to follow!
