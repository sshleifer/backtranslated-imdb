What is the purpose of revising such a movie? It's painful and embarrassing evil, not even in a way that lets you have fun with it. Movies like "Little Man" depress me. They represent the film at the most disposable. This movie was created for a bunch of 18-24-year-old boys who wanted to come to the studio and see it on the opening night before the word had shed the bad, so the movie could quickly recover investment. A hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably could not make their films because the resources were heading for this battle of shedding. <br /> <br /> Grade: F
