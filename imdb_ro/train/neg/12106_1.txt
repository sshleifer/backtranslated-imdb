A creepy, cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows that Cahill is trying to close his wealthy homes, but the male occupant is shown to be unfaithful to the bona, that's all then. The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is thrown into the car, but he is a rat with rats and does not look like a beautiful man, so that's good. Beits, owner of House Russborrough, have made their money by exploiting the "dark" diamonds, so it's good to rob a priceless piece of them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Guard kills ferrets and is involved in his assassination. Moral equivalence is cumbersome, Boorman is looking for a hit movie, but he does not have the courage to oppose the crime of the generalized gang, who has terrorized the neighborhood and unleashed another wave of scandals in Dublin. He even made a connection with the generals' son while he succeeded. Disgusting. Shame on him for his cowardice.
