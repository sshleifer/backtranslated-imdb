Ever since I was eight, I was a big fight fan. It does not matter what federation I looked at. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me the action is everything I looked at. May 23, 1999. It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and I expected to pay another view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, that night he was one of the best fighters who came out of Canada, a real human being fell to death because of a stray cascade. You can not do too much to change the situation. But what happened to Owens' death made me very upset. Rather, when we finished pay-per-view and did everything as human beings, WWE decided to protect what comes first and that's been the money keeping paid on viewing, as if Owens's death never happened. I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made stupid decisions in his life, but it was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. And I do not like to say that Owen would have wanted pay to go. Save me. When someone dies on a pay-per-view, they feel comfortable to stop them. It's like a police officer shooting a thief or a runner with a run and then letting man die so that he can go home and call him a day as if man's life had never been important. it matters what's going on. Owen will be missed and thank you for the memories of all the times you have given us.
