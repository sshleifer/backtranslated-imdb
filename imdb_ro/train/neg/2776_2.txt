King Maker is a film about a series of real events (citation needed) that took place during the Portuguese occupation of Indochina. Although the costumes and the direction of art are commendable, the film still fails to impress the spectator. The action, in particular, was extremely poor. Some actors try hard to let down tears and the accents, both real and false, are extremely irritating. The story was also too bad and too bad to be true and it seemed rather a lesson of history. The film could not capture even a kind of royal air and old age, and it showed more an attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. The costumes and the direction of art give the film a fresh breath of breath, but the execution was extremely poor, and the actors could not even give emotional outbursts. In short, the movie sounded more like a hullabaloo than a script.
