Kim Basinger plays Della, a desperate housewife with somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while out at the local mall, making some Christmas shopping. After putting a stunned hate note on a piece of paper and sticking the paper in the windscreen of a car that took over two parking spaces, she finds the owners of the machine are Rainbow cohorts of evildoers, made up of a white guy , Mexican, a Chinese and a black. She's confronted with her about the note, a guard with a security guard, and the pursuit is continued. Throughout the movie, Della will go for the hunter hunter while unleashing her inner Bronson. I discovered that this is a little tense thriller. The actor was pretty good (except for a few scenes, "Why God Why" was a bit worthy of the evil, though). It happens a bit because Della Della is being pursued from /. If he had not had the intellect of a bad "bad home", perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to enjoy instead of the reaction he evokes. The incredible factor I'm willing to ignore, both the director and one of the producers had the screen shot of "Shoot em up" (a movie that, while casting credibility on the window, was very fun) . This film, without reaching the heights of this film, was good in its rights. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Comment with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a minute and a half "Making"; a trailer and two TV spots for this movie; and trailer for lower education
