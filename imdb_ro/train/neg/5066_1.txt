This is the worst show. Buntch grew up as children without humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has more humor, and more adults than Friends of "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV and I stood in front of the tube, observing friends "just does not sit well at other, contemporary Do not miss the intelligence of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridiculing of fire that is the distinctive sign of "Frasier," the characters in "Friends" seem to be designed to make them repulsive. The characters are caricatures of caricatures, and the writing is sophomoric - although it is so intentional (it may be interesting to notice a written session from the writers might have to escape to reach it goals smaller than their capabilities, not to confuse Friends of Friends loyal.)
