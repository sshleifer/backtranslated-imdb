This movie looks very much like "Flashdance," you know you're playing with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it's not really bad enough to be funny. "GI Jane" is much better than the movie, but that does not say too much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is high music and we get to see his fight and everything, but it's certainly not very interesting. I really think the idea behind the movie is pretty interesting, but the script is too clich√©, and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
