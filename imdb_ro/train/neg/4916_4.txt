This 1970 hit movie did not get old, but, frankly, it was not that good when released. However, it was an extremely popular success, perhaps because the fatal young love idea appealed to saturated audiences through the constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War. The story is a pure story because it refers to Oliver Barrett IV, a Harvard hockey player who meets and falls in love with Jenny Cavelleri, a Vassar antagonist student of music, proud of her working class background. His old father naturally disapproves of Jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, it means that the young couple marries one of those hippie epochs. He sets up his dream job in New York, but he suddenly becomes ill and dies of his terminal illness. There is a veneer of contemporary film production techniques exposed by director Arthur Hiller, but none of these can hide the old story clustered in its center. The inevitable conclusion left me particularly unsteady. Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw have become stars with this film as Oliver and Jenny, but inexplicable, because none seem to be able to convey the depth or complexity necessary to make compelling characters. At least the boy O'Neal is honest in his unfavorable approach, but MacGraw is so weird that it's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic face. John Marley (two years before finding a racing horse beheaded in his bed in "The Godfather") does better than Phil's father, like Ray Milland, as Barrett's seemingly insensitive paterfamilies. Frances Lai's extremely familiar music has almost become a parody over the years. The quality of the DVD printing is good, although the only extra is a rather effusive commentary by Hiller. The most interesting little bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal (whose book is based on this film) designed Oliver as a mix of two Harvard room colleagues he knew? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a little part of the film as one of Oliver's roommates.
