Spoilers both this and the Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a profound film, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was pretty good, fun, and I have a weak place for the fighting in Hong Kong. In the original, Neo was the secret life of the Anderson cube worker, quite unhappy. In day, body drones, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually, he is finally forced to choose between these lives through his actions - he becomes a villain who fights against the car or returns to the safe and forgetful world in which he started. Interestingly, he discovers that once one is spoiled by illusions, life is rather shitty. He has his daughter beside him and his companions, but he eats processed food, sweat clothing and lives in a kind of really shaky car. However, the truth frees him. At least some of the fun of that first film lies in the questions, "what if I am," raised in the spectator's mind. What if he could be impossible? If I were "One". It does not even matter so much what you are An example with such a cool title. Additionally, Agent Smith did a terrible evil, because he embodied all the fear of authority we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as a terminator, and as ruthless. At the end of the matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share the good news about freedom. <br /> <br /> The film fails to fully realize the ideas of the original film and does so with a lack of taste, so scarce scripts and editing so weak that I can not believe they planned these changes. When the dialogue is at a fifth-class level, with different long words at random, I find it hard to believe I understand what they say. My short list of characterization failures: <br /> <br /> Oracle goes from mild relief if it is deceptive obstructionist for no real reason. <br /> <br /> Most of the "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster, for example, was but not just an interesting character. Fishburne loses his role as a "counselor," and receives nothing to replace him. The people of Zion are not particularly interested. and you do not really let them lead the world. <br /> <br /> Special Effects Problems: Battle scenes are useless and intermittent. In Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose and that he had to become a little bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, it is just the character of a point of view of a particularly poorly represented video game. <br /> <br /> Fighting on the highway seemed rather false and not interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing Problems. As mentioned above, battle scenes were endless. Rava went too long - everyone in the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we thought of good dances and good orgies, but because we did not know about the imagined people and did not care. Any hack wrote soliloquia to the creator should be on the black list of the business. He went, used the words that the screenwriter did not understand clearly, and was a waste of time and a rhythm killer. The Creator's speech could have been done in a tenth of a time, and with more danger that "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go so as not to destroy the Matrix." Now there are too many people who do not think, the matrix is in danger of collapsing and killing any person connected to it. In addition, the earth can not support the people of Zion, not to mention the others who are currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we have a long, traced heap. If someone claims to be deep, ask for a transcript and try breaking the phrases. Each of them is too long with some clauses and uses words with clearer and shorter synonyms. So, in summary, it is not worth seeing. I've seen the third, and despite what some reviewers have said, skip it. It does not save this turkey. Reviewers who think the second and third films are "deep" should go to see deep-rooted movies. She can read a book or two about rhetoric and debate and perhaps a bit of philosophy. This movie is not hard to understand, but it's hard to stomach. Scott
