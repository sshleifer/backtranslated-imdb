This movie was extremely depressing. <br /> <br /> The characters were so cold. The mother, who is the main character, is only "mother". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and her children first. Her husband dies. She then goes to visit her son and meets this piece that lies with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the movie is fine. It's not great, but it can be looked at. The guy is charming and who can blame her? Okay, it's not very mother to sleep with your daughter's girlfriend, but to blame her on the shock of losing her husband. <br /> <br /> She gets totally obsessed with the guy. I think that's where I started to make my movie. He always wants to love them in an "old-fashioned" way with snacks while working at his son's home (I think that's the only thing he ever learned to do) as if he could have been Attention. Obviously, the guy is not very interested (in fact, he rather seems to have considered sleeping with her a charity activity) and, instead of being insulted, continues to ask him to go to sleep with her and be cute with her when it becomes very abusive. "I want to thank you," she says in a desperate way, while insulting her very badly. <br /> <br /> What indignated me in this film is the total lack of self-esteem that Mom has for herself. She tells Craig something like "I'm just a formless lump" the first time I sleep together. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to women's nature. If it were me, I would have bought a small object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and less emotional pain ... :)
