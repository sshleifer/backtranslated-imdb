This film is weak, boxing box says the most difficult band in East LA and is really Santa Ana, James Cahill acts like a queen of the closet, taking down all the tough boys in Chlo's gang. It's fake, boring, meaningless and crying, I tried to get my money out of the video store, this movie was so bad. She was also on the homo-erotic tip away from what video tapes proclaimed. James Cahill should act in Gay Porno. James is in every scene, can not act to save his life. The movie features Eva Longoria, which is hot, but James can not even score with her !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I felt like watching Gay Porno and stopping the whole movie. James certainly wants to be with men, but rather to obey his homosexual wishes, beat band members over and over again. His martial arts skills are at least minimal. Some members of the real gang would take him and his weak skills and break a new one.
