I watched about 30 minutes in this movie before I finally get sick of getting stuck with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot", and each actor. It's like everyone thinks they are the main part of the movie and they call out "NOTICE ME!" again and again. The bad guy has bad music that happens and says sinister things, like the bad ones, just in case you did not get caught. The good guy does brave and noble things just in case you do not know he's the good guy. And, sir, the scene of the plane. "MY GOD IS GIVEN! YOUR GOD IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE YOUR BADS OR MISSING TO THE TOALET OR NEVER, YOU MUST BE LOVED!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but, frankly, he woke up and began to panic before he had time to look at the place he had occupied.) <br /> <br /> A religious girl , I want to apologize to the world because I lost the movie I printed. And I want to come back for 30 minutes.
