This film offers nothing new to a genre that has traditionally shown the story of intercultural love backed by mid-20th / pre-World War II politics, where the British and their modern ways are evil, and the primitive Indians, but honest and true are good. Certainly, such British sketches are rather fleeting. Apart from the drama that feeds the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the act is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the obvious and unimaginable direction. The story had to be strengthened, and it certainly would have benefited for another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and the narrative more depth and give something to the viewer to feel some investment in. <br /> <br /> All in general, rather uninspired. Oh, and Linus Roache can not do tragedy - crossing with emotional pain does not work for me!
