I felt the dead brain, I tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought it was Peter Jackson's movie of the same name). The performances are so terrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects did not resist the test of time and look terrible. The script promotes this type of TV movie, looks at the way the middle distance acts. The look looked as if she had taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look and they are about it. Plus, I've never been confused with a movie until I've been watching it. It's a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration triggers in minutes. Avoid a plague.
