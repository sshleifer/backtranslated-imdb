What a shame is when a potentially exciting and invigorating little story succeeds in blocking your interest at first and then awakens you gradually and further until you leave your head scratched until it reaches its outdated conclusion. Unfortunately, that happened to me until the end of the white noise. It was not Michael Keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him return again as a star of a new film, perhaps a little wrinkled, but still able to offer a strong and honest performance. As a man whose wife recently died, he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the later life (not a new idea), apparently tired of her through that electric fuzz business that you see on your television screen when it is not transmitted nothing. The idea of ​​spirits communicating through radio waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are a lot of people who actually believe so I'm not going to comment on I'm thinking about it or to them. Let me say that it's all about suspending mistrust when it comes to buying in fantastic movies like this, but what I can not tolerate does not understand what the hell should be happening, namely where I was left left when the credits eventually began to roll. Very static indeed. There are sometimes films like this that completely confuse me, but if a movie fails to make it clear to me, I tend to think that this is the film maker's fault, not mine (if I did not look at it while I was too tired to focus or something). For the white noise, I was very awake, with bright eyes and good eyes, so guess who the guy is?
