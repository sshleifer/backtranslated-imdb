I already know that critics and some auditors say it was a satire, that there were many political and social messages, that the name refers to other names, etc. It may be. I can not do such things (I do not want to do anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "cinema." Regarding the film itself, once again it is said that the film is intelligent and powerful. We could not see anything we do not see in monster films, except the scene that takes place in an office in the second half. Yes, that scene says something about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is fun (easy) and exciting in moments or scenes, but no more than that. As far as the biggest flaw of the film is concerned, it is a visual effect. It was just shocking, I could not pull together for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old Gojira movies, was made in 2006, but it was not. It's like you do not think there's a monster, you can not care. If you agree on this, I highly recommend Cloverfield, which is extremely realistic. Monster design is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically critical. Some critics talk about it as if it were a Kurosawa movie. Yes, it's more like a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean it's dramatically strong. I do not want to compare the host with other monster movies, but I'm trying to say that the Host does not do anything that other monster movies do not do. By the way, there may be some people call the masterpiece of the film because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's the truth.
