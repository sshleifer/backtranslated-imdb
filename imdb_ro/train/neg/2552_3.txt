It's listed as a documentary, it's not, it's kinda filmed like a documentary, but I suspect it's just because they've disappeared from an unstoppable room and unwanted movies. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an "American Pie Comedy", it's not that either. Basically, it follows around a group of teenagers in the spring break while going to Mexico for cheap drinks and with the quest is to get there virgin friend finally put. Throw a pair of dwarves also on the same type of search and you have a non-hilarious story about drunk teens trying to get some girls. Given the rating, this has very little nudity and practically zero scene scenes, mainly I think the rating is for the swearing that there is a lot. If you like Black Jackass's behavior without humor, then this may be your thing if you have any left brain cells then I would probably avoid that!
