This movie does not deserve the movie to which it was photographed. Dialogue is flat, filled with stunning enemy lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound for the first time when they read a script. The blurred, unclear film style is a cheap imitation of visual effects in the "ring" style. Characters do not even act as an ordinary person. For example, the character who searches for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door, sneaks around the house, horrified and crying, and does not even tell her sister's name to see if she is at home. What the? You think she just buried her sister instead of looking for her. How many revolutions since childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are the typical sign of an amateur director. It's actually amusing looking at the many pictures of the woman driving the car on the street, up the access road, around this corner, here, there, a side view, now a front view. Enough already. You'd think you're looking at a Solaris TV commercial! Horrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really bury anyone who spent money doing this movie or looking at it.
