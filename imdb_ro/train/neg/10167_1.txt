This TV movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw this was that it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played and we see that behind the scenes is nothing. With the numerous stars in this movie, he made no difference. I really do not know why I looked at this.
