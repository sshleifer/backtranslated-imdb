I'm sorry to say so, but acting in this movie is horrible. The dialog seems to read its lines for the first time. Perhaps we accidentally got the "clothing rehearsal" version. The director uses slow motion during special effects, perhaps an attempt to compensate for the poor performances of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the battle sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action movies. The fighting seems pretty real. But all this happens while two main actors miraculously survive, miraculously, incredible amounts of automatic fire, grenades, rounds and bazooka. The enemy soldiers are certainly some of the toughest blows we've ever seen, especially when they have the truck that has escaped in their view from about 30 meters and each shot of the bazooka is at least 50 feet wide. These bazooka need a serious site calibration.
