** Possible Spoilers ** This direct video bet combines a gun-toting hero, Z-grade effects, Nazis, a mummy and insecure lesbian pictures and is still boring; the duration of 45 minutes of the SEEMS movie as Eternity. The only good part is one of the best moments in which the bad guys force a 400-pound Egyptologist in a chair - and a bastard's foot gets almost crushed under one foot of a chair. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch the game of television, bowling or tennis.
