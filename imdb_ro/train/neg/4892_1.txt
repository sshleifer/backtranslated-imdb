they are having sex with melons in Asia. First of all, I doubted that, but after seeing the devious cloud, I changed my mind and finally I was convinced that they had sex with green melons, dead or alive people. no safe sex, of course. (the terribly ugly man) pushes him into the lady's mouth after he has done the dead lady. have not you heard about HIV? do not guess. Otherwise, this movie is mainly boring, but also incredibly revolting. in fact, in some parts it became so disgusting that I could not take my virgin eyes. sex with dead people! how hard is this? and what is the message behind everyone? we need water, we need melons, must we be dead to have sex? I'm sorry, but that smells!
