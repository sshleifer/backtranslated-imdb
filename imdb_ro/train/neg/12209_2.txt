Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother had a policy that a person would have had to pay. And, while I never paid to see some shit they went, I could not resist a free movie trip! So I came to see the crap as the second movie Conan and NEVER OR NEVER EVER! Now, despite the fact that it is a wretched film in places it is fun to watch - a kind of brain dead. And, technically, stunts and work room are good, so I get the rating up to 2! Why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, he has almost no plot, Rambo himself says only 3 words (other than mumble and shout), is a useless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the film is a stupid giant ) special effect. And what special effects STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL. While 12383499143743701 bullets and missiles are shot at Rambo, none have any effect on it and almost every bullet or arrow rambo kicks hit his mark! And while the bad boys use AK-47, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes that Rambo has had is a bow and arrows with what seems to be like nuclear power tips! The scene in which a bad man pulls him while releasing slowly and calmly one of these exploded arrows is made especially for the viewers! It was wonderful parody in UHF playing Weird Al. In addition, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also has a funny genre parody - not just this stupid scene. All in all, a movie so bad and useless, is almost like a self-parody!
