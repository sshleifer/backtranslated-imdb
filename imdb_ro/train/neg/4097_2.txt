The bad news is that it's still terrible. I gave her a 2, because sometimes some of this kitchy slapstick parody seems funny. It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker," and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking very much when I watched him and I felt generous. However, "2" is. Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's done pretty fast. She takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and struggles with the scenes, hacks them, scours them, escapes dialogue and crashes the whole mess in about an hour of truly amateur amateur film. <br /> <br /> It would be better to smoke a lot of something strong if you want to enjoy it. Take your DVD back to the video store in time! You will really hate if you have to pay a late fee.
