First, lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you try to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee it will destroy it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, then it's quite fun to look at. As with another commentator, I liked the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - between the flame jetting from his hand in the car. Another big camp scene watched John Landis as a producer of radio shows melting around the room. Actually, I discovered the last 15 minutes of the movie as a laughing laugh non-stop - I'm not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it was.
