Let's see ... I'm trying to find positive in everything, so what can I say about Pallbearer? Know! The performances were - not that they will not work because they managed to drain all the personality from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and they came to create cartoons from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh, what's the story? This is not going to fly either, because it was the induction of the dose. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny, it excludes the comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a love story between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because they can not be sure - to call it "the losers". I'm sure the ones behind this movie started with a vision, that is, they had to have one to fit in with the studio costumes, but I need some help finding it. Even if I was a patient who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I could not, in good conscience, recommend a film that would allow a guy to enter a professional interview in a dirty sunshine and dirty hair and stupid. Talking about hair - must we be amused by the intentional black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey? What I do? We have already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in real-time viewing of the movie - I can not spend more time on this miss.
