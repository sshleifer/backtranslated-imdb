Ugh! Another of the DVDs "slammed by the cover". I expected some kind of action at least with bears, cats and so on the cover. I have nothing! The bad movie! I forced myself to look at it all the way, thinking that eventually something would happen ... without luck. Now, the reason I gave this was 2 is because of the landscape; otherwise it was sucked. The child was terrible, talking to himself (though I suppose they could not just play a bad music movie and no dialogue at all), making karate pillars on a strange tree, threatening a raccoon, eating the worms and (what noise) hitting a porcupine. And he would not have pulled those rafters so lightly ... either as a hook. At least he fought the bear (weak) several times. What happened to flashback stuff? He made a bad and worse movie. I wanted to see a survival film, not a dramatic film about a child suffering from divorce. What else can I say? Well, maybe the bear would have to eat the baby or something like that. At least that would have been more interesting. People, do not waste your time with this.
