Bill Maher's religious is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a bunch of Rabbits who invent deformed machines to get Sabbath rules, he does not even attack Judaism and seems to be angry when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis on his logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so-called "holy books" of organized religion. This is proof of its complete and absolute lack of objectivity or concentration in the creation of this film. It seems to me very hard to believe that man is an atheist or even everything that is intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them bad for their beliefs, but what do you have to offer instead? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him be the "rational person" in the room? In a way it reflects how he is not, and at the end of the process he looks as bad as those people. If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about evil evils of religion and how can religion be detrimental to human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' "root of all evil"? It is a brilliantly researched documentary that clearly highlights what it hopes to achieve and how. Bill Maher's religious is not funny, does not ask interesting questions, nor does he give a perspective on such a controversial topic. It seems to be the ups and downs of an old man unhappy with his Catholic education. I'm almost sorry for him.
