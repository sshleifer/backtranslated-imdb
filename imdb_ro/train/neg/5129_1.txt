The message of this film is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo should be a "ugly doll", but the funny thing is she is not ugly (in fact, she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now this movie would work if the "ugly scent" was really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop with this hypocrisy? In my opinion, despite the message he wishes to convey, this film is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
