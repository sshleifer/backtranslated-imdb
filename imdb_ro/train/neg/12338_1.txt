I saw this original movie in the theater when I was 10. Even at that age, "humor" was slightly insulting to adolescent intelligence. In the past, whenever I see Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum I would be wandering and I will start feeling very uncomfortable and even sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt that way. Apparently I stuck the memory of this movie, but my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators have remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie, but I was subconsciously crying the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, not EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work. I was not brave enough to try to see him as an adult. I imagine that, in the healing process, I should probably think about confronting this childhood fear so that I can really put it behind me. Some regression and / or hypnosis therapies may not be a bad idea.
