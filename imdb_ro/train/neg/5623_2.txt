Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a Jack London adventure movie is not a bad idea; he certainly drove an interesting, sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, is spinning flat and unsatisfactory. The most important is the lack of integrity. Michael O'Shea (London) has several speeches in London; and it's nice to see his bearded jack get "The Call of the Wild" after spending some time of quality alone in the snowy mountains with his dog Buck. Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film attracts unfortunate "yellow dangers" that are parallel to the lives of London and World War II, both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
