This film starts with a certain amount of promise; but, in my opinion, it starts to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to help when the car breaks down. That this well-intentioned foreigner starts to fix his car while he is away making a phone call quite improbable but that he is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family back on the way is the guy coincidence beginners writers are warned against using in their stories. We found this movie the best movie. Art could have been much better, just as cinema could have been. The actress was good, so did Eva van der Gucht.
