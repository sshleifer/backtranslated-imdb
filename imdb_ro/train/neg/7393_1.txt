I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does, though I do not have the street faith to eat the frizzy-mullet tail. Once I have affirmed my own bias and affection for the favorite stage of the American body and the hero of the screen, it is with a hard heart that I have to say that this is his worst film ever. I'm not sure it could make a movie worse than that. In his defense, major issues with this film seem to appear in post-production. It's painfully obvious that the movie was supposed to have a different story. This results in a weak voice in which Steve's voice does not synchronize almost with that of the repeated voice. Editing is pisspoor and generally this starts bad, it gets even worse, and in the end you will want to be rewatch your Da Vinci Code in return. Yeah, it's so bad. After that, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends laugh at me because I listen to his CDs. Is it time to start checking Van Damme files directly in the DVD wallet log? If you are tempted to watch this movie, have fun with your eyes and wash them in the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes.
