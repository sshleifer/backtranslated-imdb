As usual, I do crazy madness to see the movies I have not yet watched in anticipation of the Oscars. It was really looking forward to seeing this movie, as it seemed to be right on my driveway. I can not understand why this movie came to my life. There is no story! A group of boys are moving around Iraq. One day, they broadcast a bomb here. Tomorrow they work around the landscape, by itself no less and start to snap fire. He does not expect to return to Baghdad. There is no coherent story. The three main characters are so much characterized as simple caricatures. That's what I mean, we have a sweet baby who's afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to return safely. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who does not follow the rules, but it has an unpleasant place for the little Iraqi boy trying to sell the DVD soldiers. What do you think will happen? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules will take the sweet-wounded child with his renegade ways? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that the cowboy soldier has a soft spot will be killed and make him crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. Script is minor and predictable! The room is agitated around a crowd to make it look like "art." And for anyone who thinks it is such a picture of war, go for rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
