They are probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book based on this film. After reading this great work, I could not wait to see the movie version. After watching the movie, I was TOTLY disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and name of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a play show. The main object is to survive. But it's not in an arena. He has remained free in town and has to escape the villagers in the game show (I think you would call them), who have absolutely no resemblance to the characters of the movie. This premise made a lot of tension and suspension and ended with the climax. The film was absolute garbage. It was not a cinematic quality. I respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he did it with that.
