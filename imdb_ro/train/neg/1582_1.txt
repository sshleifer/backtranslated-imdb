Argh! this movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. Perhaps it's just my growing hatred for the kind of action, but even as a child when I swallowed like the seals of the navy, I still considered this film with discontent. I now despise it altogether. Take a fairly good story. hold the title and throw the rest. Instead, he uses a story of half-gladiators that is so full of plot holes, all that is in danger of collapsing (why there is a rebellious base in the middle of the arena, such as cake cameras in -the unguarded room?) the entire film sparks eighty years, from terrible scores to shining costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. I know some people liked it, but some people come down because they are pee and I do not understand them.
