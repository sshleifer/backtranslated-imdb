A fluffy and useless fluff puff (fluffy puff, but fluff). Very scripted, with novel and woody dialogue. You do not care if the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little attention to everything. Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest you - those gaps between the panels of all buildings may be true to how they lived their lives. The framework meeting is useless and distracting, and the character Hoppalong Cassidy himself is both boring and inherent.
