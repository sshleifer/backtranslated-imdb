I DO NOT BELIEVE! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny like an Elvis-in-the-box. Besides, how did this sign half way down to make such a blade movie? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time ... I'm not laughing to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the table is wasted, the direction is amateur. Now, when I think about it, most of the guilt is probably the director, Joel Zwick. It only brings forth flat performances from all involved. Do not waste your time as I did; but then, I like a good job of the train. Geez, now the system tells me I need more lines - here you go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it was more fun than anything in the movie ...
