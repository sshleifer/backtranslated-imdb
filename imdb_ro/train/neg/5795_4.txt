"Lies" tells of an adventure between an 18-year-old female student and a 38-year-old married man with a pair of protagonists who spend about half of the time on the screen doing sex and hockey whipping and the other half moves through the pathetic birth of the story that seems little more than an excuse for sexual scenes. With a very low production value, including obvious sanitary appliances and fake softcore sex, to a story that is a dirty combination of comedy and drama, "Lies" is rapidly reduced ad nauseam. With a duration of nearly 2 hours, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is not advisable. (C)
