Super Sexy B movie actress has another part as girlfriend of Ray-Liotta's future "Goodfellas" girlfriend in this box office bomb. He plays Marion, he has only one line of dialogue, well, a real dialogue word. She yells "Joe!" Ray's character breaks poor Zadora Square with a plastic garden sprinkler. This movie is so bad though it becomes funny, sometimes hilarious. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love that! Check the hysterical scene at the end of which Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the edits and effects I'm doing to try and show how bad Pia's character is. Pia plays an aspiring writer at Hollywood in this respect. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah sure. The pie can barely talk, let alone! The market is absolute and absolutely stupid in this bad role. But who cares? The real star is Gloria Annen, hot and fresh, in her leg in her cat's opinion! Rock on glory!
