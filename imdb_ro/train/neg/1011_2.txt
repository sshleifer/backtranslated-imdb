LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And is the star? I should have known better than renting EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, we rented this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV, you know it's one of two things: indie or dog. Just like on the shelf. What did he do? And with good reason. The plot as such involves a team of corrupt policemen at MAGNUM FORCE, and the "journalist" Timberlake is the only brave enough to discover. He is targeted for his efforts - or maybe I should say for his horrific act. I stopped her after one of the bad guys was shot on his forehead and still had the intention of returning to his shooter and smiled before he collapsed. Just terrible. The real report for how bad this movie is is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie, sporting an impotent beard, showing him nothing more like a hobo. You know the director was not in control. Freeman is clearly slumming.
