The dysfunctional family goes home for holidays and murder and the result of chaos. Violent sexy Milligan at his biggest house. A little better than a home movie (as much as Milligans) is a 1960's depression style. Notable for nudity and copious sex, this movie is neither sexy nor terrible, playing now more than weird . The film suffers because of its uneven distribution and the cheapness of production. (Nobody was sure if the money went on his movies ever since he was broken). It's a bad bad movie that does not deserve to see it except as a Milligan composer or because it has some people who look good around.
