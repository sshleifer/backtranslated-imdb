As many others have said, this is a terrible movie from all aspects of filming. How ever some well-known actors to get this project are amazing. Many people complained that they were shot on cheap camcorders. Yes, video was shot, but not "inexpensive" video. What has done was illumination, white balance, shooting technique and editing. There were so many different techniques of shooting and editing used that it was a production misery. Due to severe, inconsistent illumination, on the use of handy photo (ay Woody Allen), rough editing (another Allen technique), but poorly realized, with no real purpose. The lack of white balance in the restaurant's kitchen scene is embarrassing; very amateur. Simulated sex scenes have no action value at any level. How he ever made this film to print it is beyond me. It is worthwhile to watch if you are only amazed at how bad it is.
