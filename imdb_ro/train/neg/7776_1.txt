What garbage load ... I can not even begin to describe how horrible this movie is. The evaluation here is very hard to believe. Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first ghoul. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed .. a brilliant film with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was "alienated" - decent as a self-stable film, but obviously not up to the first level ... The third is an insult to the series, the period. I rated the movies: 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. Oh, and yes, indeed is settled in the past, sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all embedded in with a native American mythology by half. Sisters have no real story, no progression or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be "together forever." That's as deep as it gets. Sergeant that the girls agreed to be in this bunch of shit after reading the script. Oh and another thing, waiting for action was terrible - people are nowhere on a regular basis, just as girls turn around and there is a candle-lit design with a mystical American woman just sitting there on the way to enter into a speech. The sets were terrible, they could not escape the fact that everything was obviously based on a set that really did not help. Also, there was snow constantly outside the camp, but it did not trace it inside (for the set). Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped he would be at least as good as the second.
