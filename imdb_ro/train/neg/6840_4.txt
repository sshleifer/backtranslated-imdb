While this trip certainly does not amount to its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, after putting the waste in a city block with "Videodisc Cannon", we see a bend of Nimoy's face. As one tear bursts out of the left eye, we know at that moment that Nimoy is more than a killing machine. The visitor can only help him get pulled into his emotional disturbances and we understand that his previously paid affection was just a facade. Absolutely brilliant! Sexual scenes show a beautiful, carnal, but not pornographic balance. After that, I felt that I had a pretty good understanding of how the Videodisc Magnavision Player worked. Too bad they did not produce them in over 25 years.
