The thin story refers to two brothers of small towns and their battles over family honor. David Morse is the responsible policeman, directing the "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, the bad boy, is a former soldier and was convicted. As an actor (especially in her early years), Sean Penn seems to modulate her performance within the Method. Turning the writer and director for the first time in this artistic theater, obstructed, he makes his scriptures and characters through the same methodical process, slowing down the rhythm to a crawl (apparently to catch every nuance and inflection). This approach could be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters, but Morgen and Mortensen photogenic are not really convincing like the brethren. Worse, we expect more of the veterans with feeble excuse Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who just have a chance to come up with something exciting. The picture is a canopy with turgid sequences, a stupid narrative and a confusing editing (always inclined to point to artistic excesses). Penn's envelopes with the camera show a talented eye, but they are mostly an irritation. * 1/2 from ****
