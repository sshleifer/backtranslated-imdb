It follows the same path as most follow-ups. The first one was great. The second was average, and this one, a bit of bad action and a stupid dialogue and a lot of suspicion of mistrust, this film was weak. Very predictable and I just could not stand that Henry Wrinkler - like the boss with that stupid eye, was all the more so he could have done. I really enjoyed it first. I would have liked them to have gone more on those lines than on what they did here. Was it too much inexplicable to explain, at what time was this, and why is there an old fashioned phone in that room? I understand there is another work. <br /> <br /> Blah!
