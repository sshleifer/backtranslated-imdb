You will recognize the plot immediately. The daughters of a divorced couple are trying to bring Mum and Dad back together. Yes, this was the theme "The Parent Trap" in the '60s,' 80s and '90s. But that's scary. Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than Hayley Mills, 21, playing the roles of her eager daughter, Durbin seems much older, as is the case with adults. So did all her brothers so-called. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child is done throughout the movie. The girls are dressed in nice sailors' suits, but look ridiculous in them, while the director seems to have the pain to show his amps and shrubs throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between their thinking as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "hurt", you feel as if they were pedophiles and you could be, because you've noticed those coughs and tops the director has indicated. Adolescents or attempts, girls or foxes, you are never sure of what you should think about them. Parents seem very good and the whole movie looks very dated <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of the parental trap and you should avoid it or at least make sure that the tetanus images are updated if you do not believe me.
