0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The act is one of the worst I have ever seen, which is really amazing is that Anyone is terrible, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is obviously hopeless, the score is terrible, I would not say that the movie was edited, brutally cut would be a more appropriate phrase. Combines serial killers, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumbass. Dumbass. Dumbass. Not at all scary, the special effects are disappointing. bad bad all along. The writing was terribly bad. Cinematography is actually cheap, sometimes very granular, and the camera is terrifying. Again, what really makes the film is how bad all the actors are. Cheesy.
