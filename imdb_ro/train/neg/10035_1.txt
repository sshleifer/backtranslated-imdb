Absolutely terrible movie. Another loss of time. The background music is so loud you can not understand the speech. Well, if you listen closely, no matter what they're talking about, it's actually unintelligible. Work in the room is bad, editing is not present, the background score gives headaches, the action is unpleasant, the dialogs are unintelligible, the action is abisal and well Kareena looks like a fighter now looks like a starving fighter. And you can lose weight, but you can not win the grace. After spending three hours looking at a movie, I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, let go of it.
