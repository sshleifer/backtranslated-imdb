As far as I'm concerned, this silent version of Merry is the poorest version ever made. There is no tenderness, no love or spirituality about this version, all are terrible, German, nonsense nonsense. He reminded me that the Nazis fall in love; who cares? This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this case, John Gilbert and his horror, princess, after this poor American actress, played by Mae Murray, possess a modern haircut and useless feminist style that throws me back and forth again. I like my bright and beautiful stories with slow construction; not harsh and sadistic like this. Come on, those strange lip lips, get rid of them, girl! Go see a live performance of the show if you want to have a real idea about the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar. Failing this, wait until the TCM presents the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It is much better.
