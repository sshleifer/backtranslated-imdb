You have to give Steven Seagal: Whatever his other mistakes, he has a good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there are chances to be one or more very beautiful women in it. Usually, they do not work as eye candy; engage in action and fight, shoot weapons, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face with love to match Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones and finds time to involve them both in catfight and in a little lesbian! And if it seems like spending a little too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, though acceptable, is so unexpected that it's hard to find anything else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is perhaps Seagal himself, who seems to be unable to even try to claim he cares. Being a military shareholder, there are very few beats in it, and it does not fit into his role (a stealth fighting pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which can almost offensively explain sleepwalks.
