It was 1 o'clock in the morning and I had nothing to do. Do not judge me ... please. We are back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group did it on an island. It does not take long before they meet a large "reptile" that swallows their horse. Soon, they are captured by the locals, and to get freedom they have to kill the "reptilian gods." CG suge; reminds me of CG of early video game consoles. Meetings were blades. The only positive thing I have to say about this was that Mr. Hottie was running into a camouflaged outfit. Otherwise, it's just an intermediate effort.
