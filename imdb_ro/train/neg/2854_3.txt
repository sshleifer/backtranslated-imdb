Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who has lost his mind but is now "fixed". Lane is his girlfriend, number one (Goldblum), who should have had something with Lane's sister (Barkin). (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan, and even Richard Pryor's appearance) can not help this plot, Dreyfuss proving that he is not "fixed" and is trying to kill only about everyone in front of him. , it does not mean you did not know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but the boys trying to tell Goldblum what he's up to when Dreyfuss comes out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie. The real reason I chose this movie is because I was in a recent Diane Lane shoot and tried to see her all the movies. The real escape for me was not only the terrible plot but also the fact that it did not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (though I heard about it all through the film). Even the fan of over half of the cast can not help me enjoy this movie. The parties in which the suspense had to pass, found myself laughing at what was actually happening. 3 out of 10 stars.
