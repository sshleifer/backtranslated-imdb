The head of a New York family, Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister, Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton), at Candy's Smyrner store. After Mrs. Grandin was kidnapped by dealers for the purchase and sale of women as prostitute slaves, Ms. Gail and her boyfriend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must save the woman who was threatened with virtue. "Trafficking in the Souls" has a hard to sustain reputation - it is not remarkably well done and does not show anything very unique in having a "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex traders. Perhaps it can be sustained as a movie that deals with the subject in a longer length than the usual one (assumed to have been ten rolls, initially). The New York City scene scenes are the main attraction after all these years. The panning of the prisoners behind the bars is memorable, because nothing else seems to make the cameras move. <br /> <br /> Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
