A great concept went wrong. It can work, even worse ... After seeing the first two episodes, I was wondering why he ever got into season two. Characters are forgotten, writing is poor, sets are fine. The special effects are simply sad - the more it was done at the same time - where are the money on this? The first episode starts interesting, then goes down quickly - the precept of the whole show is stupid. Now do not get me wrong, I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan and a "geek" - but this show just does not cut it. As I said at first, I'm really surprised that it did in season two - so much better was canceled after only one season (for example, Jake 2.0). This performance was very bad.
