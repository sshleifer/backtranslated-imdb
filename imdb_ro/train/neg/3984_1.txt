I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC. How? I do not know, so it's in the "so bad" charts, Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to quit when they see it now. I think Woody Allen had done wonders with the intrigue and Baldwin's part could have been played with the taste of Leslie Nelson.it was back tonight I tried to look again but life is too short. The few minutes I watched was for Nicole's wonderful she was so hot around 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman has acted in the "beautiful but dim" character of the word F, which came out of the mouth when the lady of the "brother" was mistaken as a detective accused him of such murderous sounds of murder. stay away.
