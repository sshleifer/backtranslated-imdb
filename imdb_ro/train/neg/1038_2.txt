Winning the Vargas victor is just a bad movie. No amount of denial or advertising sponsored by a dollar can change this sad thing. Perhaps Peter Sollett saw that he had no money to make the movie he wanted to do, and he decided to take the easy way out, making a bad movie that sets the cinematic cinematic principles of cinema. Maybe he knows nothing better. It's hard to say. What is not hard to say is the result. With the exception of a few viewers who will intellectualize bad shots in an attempt at pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it. I know I did not. <br /> <br /> Do not yourself a favor and submit this movie.
