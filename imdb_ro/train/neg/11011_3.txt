A series of painful tricks that seem to go forever and a day. Not as terrible as "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality" says, but in no way is approval in any way, meaning or form. Has the worst clown rhyming ever. Whatever is the most if it is not offensive to anyone but the most imprudent or politically correct. It also has the worst song EVER parody put on the film, MAIN ARNOLD EVER WORKS (not just the worst on the film, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would play in it (the reasons I looked at it first) The only fun little thing was Dickman. In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but people who make their mission alive to get this in Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something notable with you, people live. In addition, if it is true that the Church of Scientology hates it, it can not be ALL bad. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
