Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before "me" with fianc√©e Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry does not have to go any further, and her sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane), is very worried. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk with an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley has to contact Kate's spirit, hoping to help Henry continue his life. When the psyche begins to draw on Henry, Kate's ghost seems to ruin his romance in buds. There are some funny situations; but if you saw the trailers you saw the substance of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought Bell stole the Parker show. And Biggs, as usual, a pain in the ass. However, this film was overwhelmed.
