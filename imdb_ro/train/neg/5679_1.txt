I was so disturbed by the real recording from the beginning of the movie that I felt bad about my stomach and ended the movie shutdown. How can someone give this film more than a 1-rating rating. I know that the intention of the film is to shock, but to show the actual pictures of a dog that has been skinned in life (taking back vomit as a guy) - PLEASE! I locked her after the decimating baby scene. I had my eyes covered most of the time until that moment. No wonder this movie was found on the HMV scholarship. I really do not want to see another movie by this Uwe person. Anyone who enjoys this needs therapy. Period.
