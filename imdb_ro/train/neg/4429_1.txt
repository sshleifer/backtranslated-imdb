What stupid bad luck. I will not even waste time evaluating any of the points in this show. It's not worth the time. One of the comments I'm going to make is - why do we get such a DUMB, doofus inarticulated to be the star? There are not many negative testimonials to the damaged mental health of the networks than FOX has said that it will not bring John Doe back (a decent series), but will bring back the dead brain as Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing brain cells from the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX lost it, IMHO.
