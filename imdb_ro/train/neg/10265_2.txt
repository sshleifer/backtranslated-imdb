Kirstie Alley, looking a little thinner, but only a little, is in this mess, alongside a man who is a MacGuyver look, blond white hair and everything. The premise of the film is about an older woman (50) who can not get her screenplay due to age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew to appear as a writer. It's not an original idea, not a very good film with bad acts, an inherent dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot concerning a writer with a passion or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor portraying Kirstie's brother is so woody and miserable, it was torture to watch his scenes. What to say about this movie. Avoid it.
