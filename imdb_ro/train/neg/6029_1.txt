If you are wondering where many conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel, and international affairs are coming from, do not forget. This is not a Hollywood supernatural movie based on some biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. Like a movie, the end result sometimes looks more like clips from a TV program (complete with family prayers and light that breaks through church windows while harps sing). For mass viewers, it can be hard to believe, but many people believe in these things literally, as they were featured in the film. And that can make the big movie. Probably you will not find a more concise exposure of the bizarre views of a significant number of fellow citizens. So, if you see it, you see it as a social / cultural document. If you're in all media, you do not have to be warned about attempts to dislike propaganda and manipulation in the movie.
