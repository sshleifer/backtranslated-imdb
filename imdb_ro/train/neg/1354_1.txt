I saw his movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a student at the University of Michigan, so I know a little about the movie. Crispin Glover's movie is outrageous. Practically exploits mental provocation. Not only the Shirly Temple is antichrist (admitting it is a bit funny) telling those mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors, who is like everyone else, mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be all over it. It's not "counter-culture," as Crispin said at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, is exploitation.
