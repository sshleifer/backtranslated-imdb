I love the 19th century blows and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was taken out of our theaters, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. It would be better to take care of what we expected from these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous by the standards today, the character's development is too long, but in all of this it was laughing fun! <br /> <br /> Scenes where he misses it, because Santa Claus, father, feels right up to his mother and later when the crowd is actually showing torches of lighting - not flashlights like in the '80s, but real torches ! - I really beat the funny bone. Still, the scenes she had checked the children in her neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature. I also liked trying to figure out who those characters were. It took me a while to realize that the main character was the cute little bear.
