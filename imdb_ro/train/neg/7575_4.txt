A secluded diplomat, playfully played by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's son. There, the diplomat meets a very strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. I remembered the old blows of action of the 1980s that always describe the Russians as evil the right American government. It is interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. It's not a great move, it's usually an action movie "B". Michael York gives a certain class to this mediocre film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the role of the Russian cop, is a kind of "blah," but surprisingly he has some chemistry with Michael York. Do it, Michael York is such a good actor to have chemistry with anyone who makes a scene. Disappointing, beautiful Adrian Paul is killed in the first 15 minutes of the movie. Now if Adrian Paul was more in this movie, it would have been an action action "B" above average. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's very nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The bastard, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. She is very blond and very villainous in this movie. Rent this movie if nothing else is on TV. It's fine. Do not suck too badly. The action scenes are decent. The act might be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you will see what Russia looks like today!
