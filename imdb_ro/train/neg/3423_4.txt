This is a type of 70-year-old in the genre Russ Meyer, though perhaps less bright than some of Meyer's work. This film has "higher production values" than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's plotting, writing and action, I'm right in area B, though. Lately, this movie has become a support of B movie channels (such as Drive In Classics) in the 500-channel universe. If the soft core is what you are in mood for, this is just as good as anything else in the B range. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles's performance as "mother" is probably the best piece. None of the actors in the movie won the fame. Confessions of a young American woman are far from the worst example of this kind. It's tracked if this is your type of movie. 30 years ago, it would have been an avant-garde and risky film. You can see more or less the same kind of stuff on Showtime / HBO series these days and in real time.
