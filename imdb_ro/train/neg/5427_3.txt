A typical Goth (Rainbow Harvest looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people who feel like they have stabbed her with an old haunted mirror she finds in her new home she and her mother pillar, Karen Black, the only good thing about this travesty) buy. The actor is pretty laughable (especially when Rainbow interacts with the mirror mentioned above) and there is no scare or suspense. This film inexplicably generated 3 consistencies, each of which is a little more atrocious than the latter. People looking for a similar, but higher, cinematographic approach would have been recommended to look for just the episode "Friday 13: The Series," where a geeky girl finds a compact, compact mirror. This is getting more chills in it is reduced by 40 minutes than this franchise has offered in its entirety 4 movies. My Grade: D Candy Eyes: Charlie Spradling obliges T & A
