I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were unclear, the act was terrible, and if it was a plot for everything, it was on the back of the box. I do not think I remember a movie that has been HARD for a long time, and I'm a great fan of lesbian sex and boobs! ;) Even that could not save this movie from being a terrible excuse to pay someone standing in front of a camera. the general "zombie" effect. Since it seems that in this movie the zombies are so accustomed to running over a couple here and there and occasionally talking about it at a gas station (one with a windscreen repair but no indoor bathroom), the kind of zombie - even a factor to the end. Even then, a dozen of zombies chopping a girl's clothes is not really a zombie movie. Vampires: It seems all the zombies are men and all the vampires are women, which is okay with me. I'm not sure how vampires are in the light of day, or why / how a soldier vampire stood in the middle of the road, still holding the gun with a stake through his heart, waiting only for the queen of the Vampire to pass it all the way. The last section of the old monastery did not make sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other lesbian lesbian lesbian vampire "Do you think I did well?" by killing the two recording heroes in the film, that put it over the top. Effective and special effects have been at a low level all the time. You could almost see the storms that the fake blood was pumped during the zombie closing, which ran away from the general. Speaking of the general, where did they find that Kenny Rogers, anyway? No idea of ​​what the general was, besides general confusion and missed. Everything, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong desire to lose $ 3. Only $ 0.02.
