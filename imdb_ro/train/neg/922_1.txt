This movie is exactly what you get when you really stretch your skills, it's like someone who just passed the driving test and then got them into a Formula One Grand Prix (I could not add the US Grand Prix that anyone could pull out because of tiresome tires and you could win), that is, how short that movie is. Now you do not take this wrong, I like B-movies, about half of my collection is made from B movies, but I do not think there's enough alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. > <br /> The first story (for a B movie) is not that bad, it has the potential to create a B-Movie brand, they did not talk about the potential on Friday 13th, but potential, though. But what really allows this movie is the act, at no second I think nothing, it's like looking at QVC, except for those on QVC tend to have a heavier tan. to say I've seen movies worse, but I can not.
