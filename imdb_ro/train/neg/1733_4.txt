SAPS ON SEA <br /> <br /> Appearance Report: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> Suffering from "hornofobia," Ollie embarked on a "restful" boat trip, but he and Stan mingle with a convict who escaped (Rychard Cramer). The chaos provokes this long comedy - an OK entry, which, however, emerges as a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best works - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodically in the structure, the film culminates in a memorable journey into the ocean after The Boys are taken hostage by Cramer (which hurts a fisherman to prove how hard he is!). Gags are ok but lack inspiration, perhaps due to the recruitment of Gordon Douglas, director-actor-turned-actor, in charge of Ollie's first solo effort in the sound age (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here does not have a pzazz measure. Fair, but nothing special. L & H directors Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make appearances to guests.
