I hired this movie from the library (hard to find for a good reason) simply out of curiosity. I'm a big fan of Plath and this movie was a total disappointment. Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The scenario is horrible, not because it moves away from the original original text, but because it rages up without concentration or intent. Scenes are badly built and do not drive the viewer anywhere. What's the hurtling voice of Plath's poetry? Ms. Lazarus has nothing to do with Greenwood's situation; Plath's poetry has been fully used. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 years old), partly because of the pouring (32 years of filming, of Plath's age when he held it) and partly due to the fact that she can not act. Hassett is emotion, without craft, without understanding. Direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I give the movie a 1 is that 0 is not an option. I'm sorry about Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your beautiful work to something more appropriate.
