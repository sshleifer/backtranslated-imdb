I woke up awake awake last night watching this. The only thing I can say good about this horrible movie is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. There is no proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they are characters. The settings were hockey and inerts, and overstrained split screens were scattered because sometimes they could not synchronize with other photos. If I could give him a zero or minus rating, I would. Unfortunately, it's not even worth the time for some laughs. It's just a sad example of the money lost to Hollywood and now I'm wasting my time even thinking about it.
