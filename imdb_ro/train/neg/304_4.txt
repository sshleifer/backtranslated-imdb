This film portrays Ruth as a hard-to-drink, cheerful and sporty woman with a bit of baseball thrown. Babe Ruth's early life was quite interesting, and this was omitted for all these purposes. Also, Lou Gehrig was barely covered, and this was a well-known, good or indifferent relationship, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than bad. He was an American hero, an icon that a lot of baseball people modeled after their lives. I feel right about the memory of a great baseball player that this film has completely ignored. Shame the producers of this film to capitalize on his mistakes, not his grandeur.
