I do not consider myself one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. However, he appears as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. The most important element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and careers. Heating and humility. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians present in the concert have not disputed the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary style. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard appreciates Rufus Wainrights performances of his songs. What particularly failed in this documentary was the director's ability to allow the spectator to see what Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. Many are said in this respect, but the viewer is not attracted to Leonard Cohen. Failure is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and Edge. They see Leonard as a special icon, but I can not translate Leonard Cohen's exact value. Collaboration with U2 is a hoax. The whole live recording looks like an urgent job. And just like in the whole movie, only Leonard Cohen retains his role and can say about his own part. The entire assembly and script are much like an extramural high school project. Using effects, such as echoes, slow-motion pictures or bright images, are poorly placed. Some of the work done by the camera is bleak. Part of the score does not remind me of the associations I've been waiting for. Sometimes it seemed that the director added psychotic elements to the film. Maybe a reference to using LSD once. Unintentional humor ... at one point, Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. Initially, he no longer remembers the genre's name, until he eventually says he was punk, the punkster really took his music. The next scene of the movie is a live coverage of the movie "I can not forget" ... "And I can not forget, I can not forget I can not forget but you do not remember who"
