What the?!?? Why do people say this is "mind blowing?" Just face it, the end is on the worst endings in cinema history! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention the character 9 was an idiot all the time when everyone was killed. 1 was right all the time, if he sacrificed 9, then that would not have happened. People who give life live for a bad cause and why ... to make the rain? I admit that the movie had parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But many of them were clich√©s one after the other. And has anyone else made this feeling that it's about the "Lord of the Rings"? Characters have died for silly reasons, there has been almost no character development, and sincerely ask that it is good to stay only four guys in the world; useless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thank God! How do robots rotate against creative people in any way! It was done a hundred times! This movie is really bad, visit a movie worth watching as Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, these were good movies!
