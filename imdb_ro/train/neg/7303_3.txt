Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-wrote the script in a Roth story. This zombie film, which owes much to George Romero and "deadly live films" to the original version of Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot , to mention Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead". There is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. The act is pretty much in line with this genre, it's just that the story fails. and better achieved.having said that after he achieved commercial, if not artistic success in this film, Roth decided he was a director and went out with the atrocious, spirited, useless (albeit more ambitious) carp fest Hostel.Roth should have quit while it was behind. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, however compared to the Hostel is a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) likes this guy that the film is the wrong choice of career. Cabin fever, a weak 3/10 to not be as smal as Hostel.
