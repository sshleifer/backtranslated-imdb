This "misleading comedy" seems very compelling. Indeed, actors MUST very hard to make a basically inoperative scenario. And as a result, it really does not go anywhere. The idea that a woman learned she was pregnant after getting a quick divorce is not that amusing. And when Cooper sneaks up with his baby, because he does not want him to be adopted, he seems terribly unhappy and even hard to push this into a comedy. It's just a shame because the actors were better than the script and I felt bored with the whole mess. Since Cooper has made so many good comedies, I recommend you to see them in return.
