What a terrible movie. It was sucked. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from a bot with a nail. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh. It's not Roger Corman that I hate, it's terrible. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. Which is another thing, CGI blew out loud; I hate this awful movie. This is undoubtedly the worst movie B-Movie Roger Corman and probably the most gay movie B-Movie. It's ... it's DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I probably offended some nonsense at these times. It's just a terrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
