Is it a bad movie? You bet! I have not found a moment in this movie that was scary or scary. Stupid moments? A lot. Stupid characters? You bet. Negative effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker could have gone and done bigger and better things, he's not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheese. He's the most tormented doctor I've ever seen. He has a man who melts somewhere in Ventura County, is not too happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because he is 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there are no biscuits to be found anywhere. In addition, he has the general who is not very helpful in his footsteps that want to find the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, even if Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some randomly cast characters who meet the melting man. Eventually the movie ends and the monster takes off in a garbage to become compost. Eventually it's exactly what you need for a great MST episode.
