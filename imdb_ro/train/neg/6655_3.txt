The only way to redeem this melodrama melodrama over a long-lasting measure is the southern landscape of France and Nana Mascouri's voice singing the theatrical song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a fake accent. As pointed out, she is too old to play an age of 18 and looks too young like a grandmother with a college-age grandmother? Lee Remick is good, though she is also ageless in her later years. Talented Joanna Lumley is underused and also manages to look young for ever when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Do not know how a spectator could be seen in excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like amateur rank. The credulity that men in this epic queue will remain alone is worsening, while patiently waiting for their affections to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that beautiful Robert Urich would remain alone for decades, waiting for Stephanie Powers to eventually accept endless marriage proposals? The commitment of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. First, the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until the end of the war, being controlled by the French puppet government Vichy. We see that the French resistance has made a raid of light on Mistral's villa to steal sheets, after which all marry under a bridge waiting for a camouflaged truck of Nazi troops to surprise them and annihilate them? If you want to see a set of mini-series well done in a foreign country, do not follow Mistral's daughter. A much better alternative would be The Birds Thorn.
