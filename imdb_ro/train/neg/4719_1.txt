I just want to say that this production is very unilateral, destroying the necessary impartiality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits of the people they interviewed, so you can not have an idea if they are worthy of being heard. Say the story from a single point of view. To do this is very dangerous, because the next generation teaches the bad idea and that is why the wars continue to come. I know it's not the only reason for the wars, but it does not help anyone. You can watch this documentary, but read a lot on the Internet before. The Balkans are complex as human history.
