A lot of promises and nothing more. An all-star cast, certainly by HK standards, but man is this man a stinker. No story? It's okay, the action will compensate for this as most HK strikes. What the? Is the action terrible, weird and rare? Dragon Dynasty Dances so far are generally superb and generally considered as classic in Asian cinema. This is a nuisance. They managed to beat a few actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not bring their lives into a split scenario. There are dialog scenes in which two or three lines are spoken with a cut between each and no continuity in what the characters say. You almost feel that everyone gives a single monologue and just ignores the other characters. Michael Biehn is really wooden? Sammo Hung uses a double waterfall? No way. Give way. Stay away.
