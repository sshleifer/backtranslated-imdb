While the 3-D animation (peak of the show) has done a good job, most of the other elements have fallen. It was as if the filmmakers believed "okay, it will be 3-D, so we do not have to work so hard on the stage or the evolution of the character." And the fact that it's a children's film is no excuse at all. The audience is attracted by three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's father) as much as they are drawn to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that one of the main characters has shown was the two-dimensional scooter that overturns the plot from time to time, with its compulsion to eat everything in sight. And the absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin's appearance at the end of the movie (after watching a highly robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) appears on the screen and ruins the good time by calling the main characters of the film "contaminants" and announcing that the situation on screen was actually an impossibility. <br /> <br /> !!! ??? You wanted to tell the kids that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus did not exist while you were there?
