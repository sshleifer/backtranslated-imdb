I chose to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so far off the mark in judging quality. The film, some commentators, noted that they do not have too much gunfire - but inherent violence is repellent. Imagine killing the enemy / competitor in front of your young son or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some suggestions about the contrasting Corleone sons in Coppola's "Godfather," which seem to reappear here in this Chinese / Hong Kong movie, but the quality of the two is just as different from that of chickpeas and cheese. the film is only recommended for violent drugs ... there is no great cinema here. At best, it could be considered to be better than Run Run Shaw's usual output for production values.
