BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a remarkable and useless remake of classic David Lean in 1945, based on Noel Coward's "Still Life". A doctor removes a stone particle from a woman's eye at a railway station, is in a miserable relationship, is happily married to a social worker of the Italian ancestors. They meet accidentally on another occasion, form an instantaneous attraction and arrange to meet each Wednesday. The two fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together, they realize they have no real chance of happiness and agree to break up. Coward had a single act of original action, referring to two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of the Hollywood era, are not the notion of "ordinary people." In particular, Loren is a miscast - Sophia Loren, in full makeup, pointing to a million dollars, working as a full time social worker at a Citizens Advice Bureau, just does not sound true. Burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much makeup and wearing platform shoes, does not meet as a general practitioner. Having said that, you can not blame them because they had an affair after seeing their husbands. Burton is married to a literary critic, who spends the series on poisonous reviews and treats her husband with total contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, is rounding around the house all day and is extremely boring: the most interesting thing he has ever done is almost a business six years ago. Their final stage together will cause nausea ("You've been away, away," etc.). This great British actor, John LeMesurier, has a three minute cousin as Burton's friend and seems to be easily intoxicated, speaking with a barely audible voice. It's a sad and unforgiving interpretation, in a dizzying and horrifying remorse of a cinematic classic. Avoid at all costs.
