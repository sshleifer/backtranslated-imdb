I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After I saw her, I could go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has some romantic story elements, though it really does not rise to the level of being interesting. This film has all the signs to be made for the drive-in-the-market market - extremely low budget, amateur action and a liberal dose of sex (for a film in the 60's). In fact, I wonder if the only reason the movie was made was to make a quick bulletin and because somebody knew some strippers that they could use as an extract. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's cut head on the body of a donor who does not ask. Most potential donors are decapants or a model - whose real purpose in the film is to block while removing most of their clothes. However, they keep too much to make the movie really worth watching for naughty bits and the movie is not quite horribly enough to deserve watching the bad madness of the movie.
