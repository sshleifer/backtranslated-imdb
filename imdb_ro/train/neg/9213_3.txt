I caught this movie at a small view held by the members of my college club. We were warned that this would be the "storm of storm" of the games, and this movie is more than delivered. Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who has resumed his college career after "resting" the semester. What we, the viewer, discover as the film progresses is that Robbie was desperately dependent on a role-playing game called Mazes and Monsters, a game he renews after a group of games recruits for a campaign. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at many, many levels. A scene includes the "candlelight games" group, which is probably the best way I can describe it. While I'm sure this was meant to be "cultic" in a way, as most players know, it's horribly wrong. Most role-play sessions are performed in well lit rooms, usually over drums and a siphon box. The actor, while not an Oscar, is not terrible. This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Bosom and Bachelor's friends have stayed for another year or two over the horizon. Support support, although not very memorable, continues to keep decent performance. In the main, the bad thing is that it was a television movie that shows "the dangers of the games". See if you and your friends are planning a bad night of film.
