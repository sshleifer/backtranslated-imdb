The longer this film went on - and it seemed to go on forever - the more disturbed, the more sincere, the loss of time that stood by this total stupidity. How can people make such movies or even receive money for such garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb, as it proves that you can trick some people all the time. And in this image the main players have an obsession with weapons, so it is not difficult to realize how this film will eventually unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds bizarre how US society has a so obscene and fatal "weapon culture". Anyway: The lead actor has a loser who escapes into a fantastic world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl. He meets a family with two injured children, a teenager and a boy; cared for by a strictly strict father who can barely handle it. The Cowboy is seduced by adolescent or vice versa, and the impressive boy is apparently taken over by the winner's madness. The Cowboy spends all the time in a state of unrealism and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work to live and then commit a theft in his family because he is too lazy to make legal money. Ask: Who wants to look either a failed betrayed loser in a fantasy world that has a desire to die, or even looks at a poor family that is not really much better than white garbage ?! This movie is useless <br /> <br /> It's only saved from getting the lowest possible half-listening music mark: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
