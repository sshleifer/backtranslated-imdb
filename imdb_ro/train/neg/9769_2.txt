I read this Thornton Wilder game last year in the eighth grade. I was also forced to sit on this poor translation. Let me tell you, it's not a terrible piece, it's easy to overcome, but man deserves a much better shot. The actor was really lacking, the landscape - honest to God - seemed to have been designed from a cardboard group of three years. As if it could not get worse, the sound quality is terrible ... there is a "buzz" to mind whenever an actor speaks ... and also I could not see that the chemistry between George and Emily, there is not. The actors seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It's in black and white, which would be fine, but it will bring out more joy. In any case, I think that if you want to see this movie, which I do not recommend, then do not put your hopes at high. The piece, just as alienated, is probably better.
