Obviously, a lot of people really like this, but I realized that infantilising and malicious offensive, saved by forgetting Jane Russell and some memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but there is a marked decline in the invention more Late). I'm not getting along with Monroe - she should play a great blonde who's not that bad, but she's just like a fool. Russell can not convince too much when he claims he's never been in a gym, but he's otherwise wonderful. Men are amazingly uninteresting, like the plot. Under no circumstances is it atrocious, but so unclear that if it is a classic, God will help us all.
