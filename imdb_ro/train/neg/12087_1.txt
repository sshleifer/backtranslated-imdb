I've seen all sorts of "Hamlet." <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was fast and up to the point, Laurence Olivier was the best - hands down. But now we're taking Maximilian Schell to Bard. For the first time, this is a dubious version of William Shakespeare's venerable Chestnut German TV production. But if there is a slower, more productive version, more lethargic and more serious, somewhere, it must have been acted on at school level. <br /> <br /> After seeing the MST3K helps, with Mike and robots taking good jabs to the old man, punching the depth of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of German acting in English play and it seems like a kind of reluctance for Ingmar Bergman. Of course, the best parts are the MST risky. The best lines? "I will unleash the Great Danish," "Do not Believe", "Breathe", "Meet the Beatles," "Hey Dad, you'll help me with my science project," and during a party - "Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (YAAAY!) ". But then there is Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character, much more like a mannequin in the stock market, not just expressive. Undoubtedly, he is a great actor, but here comes as much as Paul Newman in "Silver Silver." Do you ever see that? You GOTTA track these two on a double bill! Finally, this is an example in which it is true that you are far better off just reading the book. At least the book is not named by Ricardo Montalban. A star just for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, of course, for the MST3K version. Prince Goodnight, not-so-sweet.
