... then they will have a good place to deposit these nonsense. Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is mumbo-jumbo religious. I was waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that I was promised, but the "evil" of this move would be unimaginable only at a five-year age with learning disabilities. I can not believe that they actually managed to find some more called actors who want to get involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it has forever changed my mind about them, and I will probably avoid anything I do in the future. I am also a little cheated that I now have a writer's name and the director's name to memorize because I will avoid everything that makes the plague from now on. It is unfortunate that all religious fanatics posting here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will receive their reviews for the first time. This could lead to an increase in the number of deceived people, as we were, to believe that this film was anything other than a religious sermon. Well, it's at the video store to get my money for fake advertising. Too bad I can not get back the 105 minutes I lost, forgetting that I think it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
