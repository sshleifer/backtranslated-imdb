The fact that this film was justified on the most successful film in the history of the film in Switzerland makes me shake my head! It is true, but at the same time it is pitiful. A film about the Swiss army could be much better. The story seems interesting at first: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to graduate from military training while in the church, the wedding of his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). The actor in a way does not really differ from just a few recruits who are getting old and stumbling into reality. Melanie Winiger plays her mediocre role Michelle Bluntschi, personally, I find it quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The story contains a comedy combined with a love story that does not work as expected. The part of romance is too empty, and the comedy piece is not funny, it's just a cheap try and it does not change throughout the movie. It's fun for people aged 12-13, but not for those looking for an entertainment comedy. Humor is weak except for a few shots. Dope? Cold! Theft? Cold! If you want a good comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not finished your military training yet and even then you did not expect too much! I give him 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is pretty funny during his screen. It's not quite a long time
