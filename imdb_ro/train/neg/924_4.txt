SPOILER WARNING ***** A really stupid film about a group of young Italian tourists who find an armor of the mythical warrior with a demonic soul. One of them bears and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon. It's time to kill, and more of his friends die under his blade to revive the body of demons. A waste of time for viewers, as young girls in the film leave their clothes, the gore is absurd at best, and the act is a terrible and perfect association for such an evil scenario <br /> <br />
