The film was shot in 1942 and around World War II, the film industry decided to take advantage of the fact that the spies were around. The film is fun to watch because of Eleanor Powell's fabulous dance. The late father, Miss Powell, was certainly a great driver in every sense of the word. She is again coupled with a very young Skelton red. The two also starred in "I Dood It." Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later, was brilliant as an interrogatory police officer in "Mildred Pierce" again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an object. The problem is that Olsen and his aggressors are indeed the Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is his habitual brilliant self here, and he gets a lot of support from Virginia O'Brien.
