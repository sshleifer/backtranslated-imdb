I can not help, but it seems to me that I like movies that are meant to be scary and I'm simply sorry. I listed him personally in my own top 10 films, right under the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and laugh just do not expect to see academic awards for acting. More chances of understanding his own film. With all sincerity, I have seen much worse than that. In addition, some maniacs who travel around the desert, wiping out the same people who have just died, is unbelievable to be original. I think one of those movies I love or hate. you can make your own wonderful thought, but somehow it gets out of it that's why I like it
