This movie is a bad thing to break off on Friday, 13th. The film is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a campsite camp. He kills people, because the campsite camp camp is on the land owned by his father, and when the police came to take his father's father, they accidentally killed his mother (another F13 take off). The intro sees Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are presented to a family traveling in the same forest, shortly after their arrival joins a strange old man who likes to talk about his son. Later, we find out that his son is Bernie and that he locked him behind his caravan after he pulled him out of a mental institute. He sets Bernie after the family, so he can take their stuff and then the pursuit is activated. This movie is only recommended to those who enjoy 80-degree Slashers B.
