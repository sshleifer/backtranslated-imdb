I sat at GenCon just because she was quiet and I could drink. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? The lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda were busy or not? True, a piece of garbage dysfunctional. The characters were stereotypical without meaning (I think ...) and wood, most of them seemed like the automatic pilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so disturbing, we cried for the writers. I'm confused about how someone can find it worth their time, Really. I only give 3 out of 10 because to be a 2 or 1, it should be either five long hours or more than Kelly LeBrock.
