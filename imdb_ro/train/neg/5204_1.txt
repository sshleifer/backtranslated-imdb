"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and fresh film I've ever seen in my life. Aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating. The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act in a convincing way. They walk, walk and walk through the forest. There are several walks around the three parts of the "Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche brochure as I watched the "Trigger Man" along the way. That's great. <br /> <br /> A total loss of time and money. I would give a 0 out of 10 movie, because this is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
