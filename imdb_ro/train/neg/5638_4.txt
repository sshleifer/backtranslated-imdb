Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy hit between the happy couple, the exotic delicacy model, and the motel timer that was out of the house, looked secretly out of the woods and aged with the boys' boys, divided the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In this process, they could have fired that freezer boat at smithereens, solved most of the problems; such as "whore slut" on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had no "friends", and explaining to him the coolness under the pressure of a bloody swab, uninterrupted phone calls. . . and that chic crawling, green green thumb and its attraction to simpler life. However, the technician with the human body. Former abortionist? Morning attendant? A little bit of heartbeat would have been nice. It was fun to watch these people move, I think, but Eleanora's Italian games were stereotypical, while the caretaker was too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind and a collection truck that had it summary. I also wanted them to have a smaller bag: Eleanora is ready to leave after she puts some black underwear in her red suitcase and the caretaker only needs a cardboard box at the motel. , you can say good. I agree, though the sticks have not gathered in this job. However, I scolded very badly, and I felt totally cold.
