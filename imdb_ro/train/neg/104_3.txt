On the way to a small town, which is far from the beaten track (but which seems to be near a suspect motorway), a female reporter turns into a strange traitor who agrees to help her direct her to the destination. The strange man then tells a pair of horrific stories related to the area: in the first story, an adulterous young plot to kill the woman's husband, but ultimately suffer a much worse fate when attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of caravans cut the short break when an outlaw outlaw shines at his peed's tomb. Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create a zombie themed anthology - a nice idea, but with only two stories, it collapses very little. And this is not the only way that this gore flick fails to deliver: the act is stupid (with Joe Haggerty, as the storyteller Ebenezer Jackson, offering one of the strangest shows I've ever seen); locations are uninspired; the script is hard; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end ... well, who believes faith. To be fair, some of Sykes' creative works are effective (although the gimmick technique used as characters walking through the forest is a tad was stunned, an ear is biting, glasses are snatched, one face is removed, the brain is wiped out there is a dirty decapitation. These positions just make the film bearable, but be warned, The Chronicles of Zombie is not a walk in the park, even for spectators driven by Z grade garbage. They give it The Chronicles Zombie 2 / 10, but generously raised my rating to 3 because I could not see the movie with the 3D advantage (although I have a hidden suspicion that an extra dimension would not have made such a difference).
