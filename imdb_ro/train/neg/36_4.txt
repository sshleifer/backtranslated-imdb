This movie seemed too long even at just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror movies is that there are always too many pictures of people walking (through the jungle, on a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to eliminate running time. The movie is worth seeing for a native and naked zombie with big eyes full of blood, which is always accompanied on the soundtrack, with heavy breathing and a lot of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be very distracted by doubling English baddies, free feminine flesh and very silky makeup work on extra monster and native extra. For a zombie / cannibal kick, it was pretty light on the gore, but I probably did not see an undeniable version.
