CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Appearance Report: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, the members of the class at West Point Academy are broken apart from the outbreak of the Civil War. Gregory Hoblit's Good History is an obvious point - virtuous men are blinded by conflict - although production seems to be a bit steady despite the details of the authentic period and distribution (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), which was fulfilled by Dan Futterman as a conscientious southerner who took over arms in defense of slavery, leaving him in direct conflict with his former northern friends. Underlining the film on such a wrong character - though sympathetic - is particularly courageous, but drama is otherwise flat and shallow, and Hoblit's direction is more effective than inspired.
