... but I've even seen better. The story here is predictable - a movie crew trying to shoot a horror movie in a place where crimes have taken place. Three suppose what's going on. This is not a total bomb - the distribution is pretty good with the protagonists John Irlanda, Faith Domergue and John Carradine performing the best. It's well done - for a low-budget movie. Just do not expect any nudity, swearing, blood or gore (the movie has a very easy PG rating). I've never been bored - it's good to watch a quiet night. I saw it on the video - it was a HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. I have not hated yet and it has a cool end that surprised me - basically nothing happens until then, so it gets you on guard. It's worth seeing, but only if you're a complete horror movie.
