The first episode put the bar high enough, I thought. He played William Hurt as a man who was contracted to kill a toymaker. We are given very little information about his character or who pays him to kill, indeed the episode is notable because he has no dialogue at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse, he receives a packet containing toy soldiers, which gives him a smile, but rejects him and deals with his business. But on a night of hell, soldiers live and are about to lead war, drive jeeps, shoot machine guns and bazooka and even fly helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show and become quite tense as he escapes around the apartment, using his intelligence to survive, sometimes getting his upper hand and sometimes not. I will not hurt the end, but suffice it to say that it was a small inclination. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all garbage and I lost my interest in the fourth. Stephen King's changes are always a mixed bag and they are no exception
