I saw this movie in my international cinema class and I was prevented from leaving. This film is nothing more than a spectacular shocking scene after the next. The fourth man is about an alcoholic writer called Reve, who has visions of his perilous danger. He meets a woman named Christine when she teaches a conference at a local book club and just decides to stay with her when she discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To make her fashionable, Reve likes Dutch sausages. So, Reve is working out a plan to seduce Christine's lover so he can have sex with him. But later discovered that Christine had 3 previous spouses, whom she killed. Now Reve's and Christine's friend could be "the 4th man." The story has meaning, no holes of plot. Editing and all that is technical about this movie is perfect. The film is rough and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not my tea cup. The film opens with Reve getting out of bed in just one shirt. So, at first, you can see how Reve's lovely cock falls in love as he walks into his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later, he has a dream in which his cutter is cut by a scissor, and shows it with the next blood fountain. Looks up a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. In addition, there is plenty of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger movies combined. Not that I have nothing against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is so blatant when it comes to shock. The whole movie rotates around the shock. <br /> <br /> So if any of these is a cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from far. My mind is still stingy.
