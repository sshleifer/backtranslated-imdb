First good news. 3-D is spectacularly well made, and they do not go for gotcha tricks. The film is based on the true story of the high point of human history and has even one of the participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. And now the flesh of the problem: It's FLIES, for krissakes! Flying big eyes, human googi, true, but it still flies. Remember when I compared my Underworld movies with rats and beetles? This was not meant as a praise, and I never dreamed that someone would literally take it. That has less empathy. Brewers? Ugh. In one of those strange confluences of the Hollywood group, this flick was evident on the drawing boards at the same time as "Space Chimps," and the creators in space. Go on rent "Apollo 13" and see a movie with 9 nominations about the REAL space program (RIP).
