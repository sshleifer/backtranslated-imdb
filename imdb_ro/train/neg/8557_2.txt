I admire Kissing on the mouth for his sincerity? pubian hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the director / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth about everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the movie falls under the land of "Brown Bunny", though with a slightly more jealous plot. Yes, do I mirror "Bunny" with a lot of nothing that happens or too many cinematic films concentrated (or frankly nefokuse) on absolutely nothing? feet, hands or genital organs. Again, unfortunately, I see why this movie was released and why people hired: true sexual sexual scenes and full-frontal nudity (just like man and woman). Besides, it was a total waste of time. We quickly learn a pair of male / female post-college males, in which the man has obvious feelings for the woman who considers him only a friend while continuing to have sex with his ex-boyfriend. Besides, we are subjected to the daily events of their boring life: she works for her parents; he is working on a highly uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For all this to work, dialogue needs to be exciting and act real. It's not the same thing and it's not as boring as if you were looking for an hour, that is, "The Bunny Brown". The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and she even makes some controversial actions. (In addition, the DVD with it in front of a microphone is worth watching / listening.) Again, I admire filmmakers, especially Swanberg, because they were not afraid to expose themselves or shower habits, collapses. It has narratives that do not fit the scene, too many boring daily events and unconvincing actions you ask, other than the porn-soft factor, why you rented it.
