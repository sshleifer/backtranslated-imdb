O.K. I know John Hughes' films that wanted to be from the 1980s were unilateral, so the expectations for this film were pretty low. However, after I stood in this stupidity, there is one key thing: it's like getting out of my head: I just stood by an 80-year-old Rob Lowe, who had no nudity and just sex suggestions in them. The actor is terrible, the boring and full characters, the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult, and incompetent, incomplete and inaccurate canoeing scenes. Unless you have some ancient Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's no reason to see that.
