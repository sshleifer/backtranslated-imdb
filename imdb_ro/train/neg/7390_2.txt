How does Italian fat washed spell that can barely pull off a martial arts movement without needing some heart medications? In this film we see Steven Seagal at the lowest level of achievement - since he started his career, it has been a steady decline in the pathetic, indulgent behavior that has ruined his career. In this film, most of his training was to order the alfredo fetuccini at his restaurant every day. It's hard, slow and very old in this movie, hardly a martial arts hero of action, more like a laugh stock clown. It's time for Steven Seagal to retire - this movie is about 2 hours of why. Plot: Italian type fat with a high reputation for strength gets wind that a murder group can play around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warfare response. This claim, though pathetic and ridiculous, offers occasions for some over the top battle scenes that include explosions through the walls as a comic book. Did I mention that this film is completely eloquent and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? Yes. I did.
