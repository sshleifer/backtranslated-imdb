Oops. This is pretty bad. The play is not gorgeous at first and the decision to transfer it to the film does not favor - especially as Peploe does not decide how he wants to treat the theatrical origins of the material (we occasionally take a look at a theatrical observer audience, etc.) and decided to go with a Saturday-style editing that intends to remind you that you are watching a movie, while, in fact, it just serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director overwhelmed with her material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is full of sorrow: the stage and the plums, it's like playing the role of Merchant Ivory by Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona Shaw offers notable performance - and maybe theater pedigree means he's best able to handle the material - but it's hard to see a single-performance film, even if the performance is just as bright, veritable and whole as Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns into an average and split turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her role as a supporter. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic has lost his wife if this film is proof.
