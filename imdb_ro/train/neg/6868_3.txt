Of course, as an Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I will be a bit biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's unique goal in making this film was the Orthodox fair. With our wigs, modest clothing and separate chairs, we are already a fairly easy target. Yakin never managed to cross the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia that he loves him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order not to swim because of his bad health. 2. Sonia struggles at her son's breeze. Why would such a powerful Hasidic woman in Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe he did not attend any of the previous ones. Let's face it, even the reformed Jews hold bris milah ceremonies today. 3. Did Mendel sleep during his hours of chosson? He must satisfy his wife's passions in bed and not kiss on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to marry for over a year and had just noticed that they were not meant for one another? An arranged marriage does not mean that the little girl has to take the first guy her parents have put with her. Nor will it be avoided by the community if marriage does not work. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business so bad she did not have to go through her lechery brother-in-law. There are Orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came out more than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she did not like the outcome. It does not come to the environment; that's what makes stereotype. Honestly, I think he got what he deserves.
