I have read other half of users' comments on this forum and it seems that the opinions vary greatly. I have to agree with those who found this movie as terrible. It prevents me from writing this, because I would have hoped it would be great, or I would not have bothered to see it the next day. I like to support indie cinema, especially if they are related to homosexuality, but this film is almost too much to tolerate. Those who came out, as I thought they did after three minutes, probably did not disturb the $ 11.00 relief, or imagined that it would not go anywhere, quickly and will not improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than I am ... or they did not pay to go first. Logan gets bored. It's a clutz. He's gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that since the main character in a movie is bored, it does not necessarily mean that the movie about him must be boring and! There are ENDLESS scenes of this baby, which is around a load of laundry, restoring everything you've already learned in the first scene, the second scene, etc. etc ... Nothing or no one goes anywhere. Nobody says anything even distant insightful or funny or interesting. Perhaps the most dreadful of all is that I did not feel the slightest empathy for Logan. This is in itself a major achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, did not learn (there is no one to teach him anything), did nothing, and not the movie! Scene after scene of the same thing does not make a movie. In addition, the title makes no sense. 1/10.
