The film is about a sabotage about losing in a fun park where teenagers are in a hunting hunt. Because there are no rules, they enter a building and begin to be killed. Deaths are black and I'm stupid. But at least it had better effects, then sabotage. I gave her three because Stacy was in it and I liked the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were off. It was a bad scene in which the two adolescents kissed the sabbath's head and the boy left his girlfriend behind, letting him show his red courage. Then the sabot rises in the ventilation holes and kicks the children out of the head. The death of the owner was completely false. Even the fact that death was bad because the tooth statues passed through his mouth and hang there so he will support it and there is a scene when a Gothic girl loses her contacts does not find them and seems she does not need her. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
