This show comes with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality, but in reality it is a soap opera. Trying to use exotic dwellings as a facade to bring people into a fake contest and then continue to create viewers on the soap contest style. <br /> <br /> It is also borrowed from a pioneer at the start of a CBS show - Beat The Clock - inventing situations for its competitors to try and overcome. Then rewards the winning money. If they can refresh their little interaction between the characters, even better. While the gameplay is slow moving towards Beat The Clock - the real achievement of this series is to get rid of reality. <br /> <br /> This show features elements of several past success stories. The reality of television, hard, but if you are hanging by competitors, local or contest, this is a cup of tea. If you are not, the whole series is as I say, the blood dripping with sauce. It's another show behind the reality label, which is the trend she started in 2000. She's slick & well produced, so it might take some time. After all, Gilligan, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch are also re-running. This does not involve professional actors. The level of intelligence is pretty much the same.
