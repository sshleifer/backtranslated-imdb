The plaque is for the Vietnam War, while Rocky IV is in the boxing championship. Oliver Stone's story about the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so troublesome that it's ridiculous. While most or all of the appearances in the Platoon took place over 10 years of US military involvement in Vietnam, to describe these casual things to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks), it gives a picture terrible of war. In the Platoon, pluton men see the following things within a week or two: American soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers violating civilians, an American sergeant who kills another US sergeant, a private American who kills an American sergeant, US soldiers killed / injured by the friendly fire, 90% + killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this movie, the typical American soldier's experience in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the real story about the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
