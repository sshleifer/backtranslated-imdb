I thought it was not the best episode of re-head that I saw (although my viewing partner gave me a tissue waiting for Brendan Fraser ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox out of the state of "coxism," which is unceasingly fragile these days, even for short moments. I also liked the attempt to place the episodes included in the length of the character's hair (or height in JD's case) and in the youth of the oldest episodes. Also, I can see how Zach might well be on the way to a Chevy Chase / or is that Matthew Perry? autumn-induced chemical slip (already recognized on Conan). A side note, the song (now locked in the head) since the dancing-induced dance was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
