As if the story was not quite depressing, this film shows that cows are graphically fat in a slaughterhouse for five minutes, while the protagonist recounts his early life as a butcher. Strange stuff. Then there is the basic premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because he is a besot-ten at work saying he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did she have? It was only she was not adopted and had to live with nuns who at first loved him and then hated him later, because he was insane. He tries to explain to us why he did what he did, but he is very impatient. Such a sad and unusual destruction. Should it have been funny? What was that about?
