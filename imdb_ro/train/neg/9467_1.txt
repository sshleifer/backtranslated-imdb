If you liked the movie Grinch ... you go to look at this again, because it was not there if almost like a translation of the Seussian movie. Mike Myers' cat is probably the most annoying character to "screen" the screen lately. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with terrible sound, which is about the only laughter I heard at the theater. Even children did not like these people, and children laugh at something now. Save your money and visit Looney Tunes: Get back to action if you are really looking for a fun family holiday movie.
