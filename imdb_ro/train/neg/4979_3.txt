Why can not anyone make a decent film from a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" with which I was disappointed in one year. But I have to say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" with Gerald Butler) was far superior. This was just a little disappointing. This is a mess! <br /> <br /> What troubled me most? Were the unnecessary plot elements that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifices? Interest of unnecessary love?) Or bad CGI or inconsistency of characters or uninspired act? Even worse was the way they made the beautiful Marina Sirtis look so horrible! And not to mention that ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And why they have always reminded us that Beowulf had the power of 30 people and yet he never showed the smallest signal of such power throughout film. He was thrown around both monsters he fought, relying on sidekicks to save bacon. Even when he served the arrogant prince, he did not kill him. He was very addicted to weapons. Beo-wimp is more like this. This was certainly not the powerful Beowulf of the epic poem! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this on a positive note, but I can not really think at one point. All I can say is that if you ever read "Beowulf," you will be infinitely disappointed with this discreet, inexact excuse for an adaptation!
