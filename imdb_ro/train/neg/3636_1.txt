I am very open to foreign movies, and I want to think I understand what they are trying to accomplish, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I often thought of how interesting it would be to make a movie that looked just a day or a regular time, which really was pointless. Now that I've seen such a movie, I will not think about it anymore. There are sounds about society, racism and some desires ... but South Park has this. And when I look at South Park, I'm actually moving to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn that I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie of seven or more because I like more in every movie. I gave this one one.
