...Ever. This is the bottom. I'm not kidding. The theater should have had a warning of some kind. "Abandon all those who enter here" would have been right. I have no words to accurately describe the hell that this movie is. His debilitating stupidity really fails to amuse. This film is clearly targeted by some of the slower turtles in the sand. The story was brutally stolen from a 10-minute cartoon by Bugs Bunny and then spread out like the Fantastic Lord 90 minutes painful painful. I remember when Wayans was funny. I assume that Hollywood's pressures to produce production products are to blame for the collapsing at a consistent rate. I'm sad and offended that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of jokes in kick-in-the-balls with a cartoon-based plot. I did not like almost everything about this movie. I'm not going to hurt anything but the baby is actually a kitty with Marlon Wayans' face superficially superimposed on the cat's body. What I said was the end. Not the resolution of the film, but the real end in which we all rose and we came out. I gave a movie at a time, but it is clearly worth less. I do not feel that the six minutes spent writing the script deserve a star. This deserves a Razzie and I ask God to receive it. When they will teach people; if you no longer pay to see this idiom, they will stop to take it out. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at any cost. You were warned.
