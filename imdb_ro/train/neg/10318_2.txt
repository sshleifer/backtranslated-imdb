Who likes a terrible comedy shown as the Little Mosque on Prairie? The only two types of people that one can think of are: One, the Muslims and the self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group that is so excited, there is a Muslim show that does not matter whether the show is good or fun to all (which is not). Two elderly people and people whose comedy ideas are incredibly predictable, misleading jokes. CBC needs to really look at what they are doing and who the audience is. If they just write comedy about really old people, then guess what's going to happen, their audience will die soon and they will not be public. I would be curious who is actually writing for this show? Do you think they are actually Muslims or hypo-amusing young people? No, I bet they are old guys who wrote the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows in the 1960s. When you look at the CBC comedy shows there, Air Farce was only just out of the air thank goodness!), but we still have bursts of blades such as "This Hour Has 22 Minutes" and Rick Mercer for which we are paying, not to mention this weak excuse for the comedy "Little Mosque on the Prairie." Is it supposed to be offensive and funny? Only CBC would think this blade performance is not at all offensive or funny. Shame on CBC for squandering our tax money at shows, only a few people would be bored to watch.
