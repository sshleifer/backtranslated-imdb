This is a comedy, but especially a bad taste, and nothing causes a smile to a movie. The movie is about a couple who is trying a child, and those real-life people who are in that situation will be lost to the pictures that are portrayed. For example, scenes from a fertility clinic are not as fun and are pretty frank embarrassments. The male lead who plays a construction worker and his heavy hat meets as a weak excuse for a rejection from the village people. The female leadership is trying to look 20 years younger than she. Both leaders meet as unattainable, unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are various ridiculous and absolutely unexplained scenes in the movie, for example with a humorless budget airline. The only reason I'm giving this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a sign for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class above anything else in the head and a note for almost decent (though old) music.
