I saw this movie back (while working on a trailer for the film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is at best mediocre, Hopkins calls his performances in (but still Hewitt blows in their scenes together) and Alec seems bored. Trust this: you should avoid this film like plague if it ever gets released. It seems to continue forever, as the tiring plot takes place in the rhythm of a snail. It is unceasingly motionless, cinema is miserable and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to the film school if he plans to direct again. As to his action, his character is completely impossible to accomplish, which makes his roots impossible for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the jury's unexpected makeup near the movie is nice, but this movie is just terrible.
