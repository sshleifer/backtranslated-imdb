As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard about an RPG. Did you seriously believe they were gay? You are retarded? If you went to save your best friend and someone decides from the heart's goodness to help you, then you are in a serious duty towards that man. Lavitz was a good person and every time they helped each other, he made them closer as friends. They were not homosexual lovers, like your stutter. And to tell you that the game is set in a time of medieval time. Then the women were just preparing meals while the men were fighting. Do you really know your history? Do you know how much it took women to be accepted in the army nowadays? This game contains a lot of realism, even if too late, slowly, to catch it, and you really need to spit out solid evidence instead of ignorant hypotheses based on your misinterpretation of the story.
