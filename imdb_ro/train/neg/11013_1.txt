They're in bad movies, but NICI does not work for that. Despite what the monsters said above, it's not funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but this is so boring that the director / writer should be forbidden to direct EVER anything other than local access to the EVER cable again! To love movies and comedy is to despise this movie. I may never see how unpleasant and boring this work was. If you like this movie you are the soul as sober there Nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare the underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or earlier John Waters. The film starts by defining satire and I advise anyone to show my satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it is FUNNY you can say or do NEVER, but if it is NOT funny you are not satirical, you are not nervous, you are just pathetic and this movie is not simply funny. ZERO!
