My previous comments encouraged me to check this when it appeared on TCM, but it was a severe disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great but he does not have enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them blocked. The film revolves around the character of Lee Tracy's character, which is physically and verbally abusive. Reactions of the "public" are badly thought out and unbelievable, making "shananigans" seem controversy by a bad writer. And he is delaying the credulity that the character Lupe Velez might descend for him. "Single nests" mentioned in another review must depend on the observer, because we have not even noticed that an attempt was made.
