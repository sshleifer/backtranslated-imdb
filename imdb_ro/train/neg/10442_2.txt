All the blogs aside, this movie was terrible god. I expected the movie to be more a farce than anything else. Instead, filmmakers have tried to make a serious thriller / horror film and missed it completely. There were only a few good parts and some good lines by Samuel Jackson. Besides, there was a lot of gore and some little animated snakes. All jokes on the Internet were more miles than the real movie. Now that the movie has come out, we hope this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of immediate rubbish. If you are looking for something that is fun and fun, then go to Snakes on a blog.
