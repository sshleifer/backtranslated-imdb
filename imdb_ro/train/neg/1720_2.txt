A handful of nonprofessional actors are being terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal motion-stop animation, but oh, how do you want this margin, when for the rest of the movie the animation will be replaced by production assistants moving around an inner tube with teeth. There is no time for terror when this film is hijacked midway by these boatmakers, who are no longer the lead characters; but once again you have to admit that trying to try to be fun is better than to go after the sheriff. Only at the end one of them is eaten and the other is left sitting on a rock crying with tears of loneliness - it's not so fun!
