After I thought about it, I thought about myself, there are too few well-known writers and directors or many producers. In any case, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that is not fun, but rather makes you brush your teeth and pass. It makes you cry "this is wrong" to the movie. Immersion is zero. Until now, most of you are probably accustomed to the terrible mistakes / weirdness of movies that hackers computers, etc. in them. This movie is so in all its aspects. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is Emily's little girl, brilliant by Eliza Bennett. I hope she gets big and does that ... at least worth something. Do a favor. Do not look at this. There is not even a proper action. Total time loss.
