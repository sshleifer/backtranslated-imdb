In fact, the adaptation of Marc Blitzstein's "Threepenny" was not so "beaten", as is generally believed. (I have a special interest for "Threepenny", my father was part of the first complete production in the US, U de Illlinois Theater Guild did it around the end of the Second World War.HJitler was so close success in suppressing the play they had to rebuild the scenario and the score from records in two different languages ​​German language and other similar sources.) Adaptation of Blitzstein - not a "translation" - which had Lotte Lenya's full approval - was much closer to the original than was generally believed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know is the MGM record (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, "big girl" and I can not see the hands on the hips and the shoulders thrown back on that line - Bea was a big babe in the 1950s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was strongly censored by Mike Curb, the head of MGM Records - that is, 17 (I think it was) "God" was cut just "damn". (At one point, MGM also offered a set of 2 LPs in the * game *, no doubt it is very censored.)
