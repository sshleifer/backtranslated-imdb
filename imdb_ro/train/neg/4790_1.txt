I kidnapped this movie. Original phantasm had such amazing ambience and mystery. Like the horror films of the '70s, it looked like a creepy and unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, at the end of the 80's, pumped the action, but maintained this pleasant attention at its disposal. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is terrible. She sadly explains all the strange happenings in previous films, which diminish rather than extend their power. It destroys shaking the images from the first fantasy as a cheap rebranding of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie, which seem to be more like household pests than death threats orbs. Hundreds of hanging from the ceiling, like Christmas balls hanging in the draft. Nobody ... the master, the DP, the publisher, the director ... have they noticed or felt it would seem so scary? Even worse, Phantasm III presents a joke, an unfortunate joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first movie. Original phantasm used humor to ease his everlasting focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to establish countless cheap jokes about reggie: more about the "flying balls" of the ha ha ha, oh, I know the balls. Perhaps the crew took a shot of these jokes, but they are ours.
