What the Bleep we know is a deceptive and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparently experts (none of which are called), who revolt and pontificate in a completely unknowing manner. Their interviews are cut into aggressively small and scattered segments through banal cgi and lying miniatures. The film discusses themes in the fields of science, philosophy, theology, and politics, and keeps them together without any accuracy, and then somewhat draws some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us the purpose of our existence and any other difficult question of answering the question that movie makers would like to point to with their finger. These are errors and logical non-sequiturs. How did we start from quantum mechanics and come to this spirituality and pseudo-scientific mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two are equal to four, so I can move objects with my mind." There is nothing original in this movie and almost nothing to be exact. Any discriminating spectator will be upset by cumbersome editing, intrusive and useless effects and lack of substance. Educated visitors will be frustrated by the tears of violence against science and any subject this film touches.
