Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon on the top of the silent screen comedians list. It's simply not enough there. Perhaps he was about to develop his style, but he sabotaged by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any case, all his tricks recall the greatest fun, but he lacks Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's extraordinary ingenuity. He also undermines his own person by dressing and walking as Chaplin's traumatic character. His marks are children's innocence, the shyness of approach, and the tendency not to react to calamities by perplexing searching, striking his eyes or touching his lips with the tip of his marker. The comedy in Langdon's films results from the fate that throws various obstacles in the path they are trying to overcome in enormous or naive ways or with minimal physicality, such as throwing stones in a nearby tornado to drive it out, supporting a building which collapses a boulder two or four times by lifting one foot so that it rolls under it. In this story, the son of a shoemaker who joins a walking race to publish a shoe of a rival company, manages to win with luck. There is nothing here that has not been done much better by the Big Three.
