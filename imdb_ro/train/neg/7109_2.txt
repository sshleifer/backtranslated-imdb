I understand now. The title refers to the immediate post-reaction of each participant after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too hard to be terrifying, lacking a good dialogue, even any fear for this issue makes Screaming Skull more like a Snoring Dull. However, the mansion and property, set in black and white, set a dark tone for the film, but that means. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money! Remember the coffin warranty at first? This may be the funniest thing I've ever seen on the screen. Sadly, the audience was likely to hope that director Alex Nichol was forced into a coffin, nailed and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny placed in this horribly unfortunate situation never attracts any sympathy you feel for a woman whose anxiety is accused of a haunted, cranial reception. Also, her husband, John, falls like a condescending speaker, but this does not work and he ends up proving how hard it is by shooting a helpless madman around! Ah, Mickey, in the days before he could get a restraining order against real estate administrators like him. This type of approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue. Still, despite his strange character, Mickey is probably the only good thing going for this film, offering an easy sense of entertainment and can not get enough of a guy who says "It was Mary!" and scouring the pots in a greenhouse.
