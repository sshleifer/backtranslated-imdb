Finally, I thought someone would do justice to the classic of H.G. Wells, not another version established in the wrong location or era, but one firmly based on the book. Well, definitely follows the book quite closely, and that's the only plus to this misery. This is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages long. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the nerves to come here and say "if you can do something better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I never used a video camera or I has ever been or drama school in my life. I paid good money to get this shit from UK in the US, do not make the same mistake as me.
