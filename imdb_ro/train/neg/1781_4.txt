Written by Stephen King, this treatment is not as solid as most of his film stories. A mother and a son are moving into a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are sleepy, feline creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus signs of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is remarkable as my mother. Others who appear are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King came as guardian of the cemetery.
