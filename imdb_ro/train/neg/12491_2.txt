Hm. While a nice movie to shoot plot holes, highlighted the atrocious action, the first (best) special effects (all this has caused me to see this movie three times in the last six years), The cut lines are among the worst seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen on the scene of the crime scene. Generally, I do not like the movie very much, because only the first 30 minutes are nice, the rest is a confusing dialogue mishmash and images that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I do not think of).
