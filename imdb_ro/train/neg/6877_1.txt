I sat down to see a documentary about Puerto Rico and came to see one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I can not see 50% living in poverty. When I see the people who fight, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no spanglish ... whether you say Spanish or not ... and from what I have heard ... is not it. Pedro Albizo Campos is not MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence that is 1%. For the rest he is locomotive like Osama Bin Laden. Pupils seeking independence are a bunch of fools. If you want to show all of your independent Puerto Rico dreamers, check out Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all of South America and Central and Mexico. His wonders were made for them. This documentary does not refer to Puerto Rico, this documentary was about Nuyoricani and about their struggles. For the person who complains that Africa was not enough for the show ... it was supposed to be Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do a short time just for you. In conclusion ... to all those ignorant white men who think we need green cards to come to the US and want to know how the prime minister works, this is not a good documentary about culture Puertorican. Tell the children to pay attention to the Geography and History class. *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc". it was about Nuyoricani. She has promoted her as if we all feel. It should have been called ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunche ... I can not speak spanish." PLEASE USE PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ANY OTHER PERSONS ASSOCIATED WITH PR THIS NUCLEAR HISTORICAL WORK. God forbids to play this on the island.
