I presented this show (I watched only seven episodes) four stars, because most of her jokes / configurations seem to fail. Some are not funny, but some are funny - to a 12-year-old boy. He reminds me of that New York painter who throws paint on a cloth, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what he has, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different. However, what she "has" is often not enough, as if it were lacking in the kind of pursuit a good comedian has to succeed. The whole enterprise is like a potato that has been done.
