Like most festivals, Hamiltons makes for an exciting watch a movie that contains all the ideas and execution. Though impressive for its clearly low budget, the film fades into its end and becomes terribly long-lasting during drawing and the obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of killer criminals who are trying to survive after the parents have died. They kidnap people, bleed from them, and feed something stuck in their basements. There are humorous, humorous shows from Mckellhar and Firgens, and the rest are just that. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing about this. But, for the first half of the year, there is a strange mixture of humor and darkness, which is a surprising achievement. The next half is not so successful that it takes in oblivion the movie with unrealistic overturns in a ridiculously queer finale that turns the whole movie into a total carp. It is a shame, although there is no doubt that a talent has been involved in this production and, although profoundly erroneous, remains original and creative. too bad that when it comes to delivery, it fails completely at each level. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
