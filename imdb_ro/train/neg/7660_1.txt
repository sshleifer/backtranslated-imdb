0 * Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. Based on the video game director, Uwe Boll tries to recreate the game in a naughty bite of action, unfortunately does not succeed. Instead, it makes one of the worst movies ever made! Even if he gets a minor celebrity such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film does not have the foundation to make a movie good, such as a story and a basic relativity of what's happening in the dark and in light. The film returns around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make monsters. Even if they looked great and the feed was good, a little lame. Frankly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final evaluation 0/10.
