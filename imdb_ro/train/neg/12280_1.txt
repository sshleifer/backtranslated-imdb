I saw one of Denver's stage shows and I was never less impressed. The word "vagina" says everything. Part of the body. Nothing is shocking here. I could tell my doctor: "My left arm hurt a little after the tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with an equal or more social commentary. It could be "Tricep Monologues" for all the fun or radical comments I've heard. The monologues were boring, but they were broadcast with drama, the subjects were outdated, and I was alternately bored and upset. Once I think I laughed, but it seems it was not when it should have. Of course, this is not really a blow. Oh, and spoilers: it was a LESBIAN! - Oh, wait, maybe not, to think about it. And misplaced fondling! And a mother Crack! That covers it.
