Recognized Japanese director Takashi Miike does not seem to be making the move with this hot thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about a bad old kid (and an abuser) who is part of a new urban legend: if the cell phone sounds strange - and see the message "A Missed Call" - you will only resume the message to hear your own final words before your death. The most successful part of the film is the tremulous satire of Reality Reality television cameras that invade future victims, but deaths that are not so elaborate (including a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and despicable. The frequent photographs of dead bodies are actually quite discreet, and this general politeness may be the reason why the movie is ultimately so steady. Hollywood jumped predictably in 2008, but the US version it was not better. NO STARS from ****
