After a first 25-minute promoter that makes you feel warm inside, you're pretty sure this will be a great romantic comedy. Then, the movie turns bad. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling may be there, but, as others have said, the plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to look at. <br /> <br /> The film is getting faster, and you get the impression that you're either fast in it, or that the producers decided to fit in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes. Realism is not an end in itself, but as a spectator, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, it happens to be. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie has some beautiful interiors and, despite the bad scenario, I think actors' performances are mostly good. If I could only write the first 25 minutes, I would have given an eight. As it is now, it becomes a four. ... And that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you are a sucker for romantic comedies, you will probably have a great time anyway. If not, I would recommend you watch something else.
