The dream of an art house. Overrated, overworked, overstretched; a pretentious melancholy that not only deserves the best picture since 1951 on its own merits, has been ruined by competition from the start. Locate in the sun, the detective story, the path called Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the invisible man; you call it, if it went out in '51, it's better than this crackling art. The closing ballet is a stutter for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong film. Few actors in their time were less capable (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. Worst of "51" (I saw 201 movies) and among the 5 best Oscar Best Picture winners.
