Besides all the technical mistakes .... What do you say about a flight attendant woman who can kill, alone, 4 of the 7 terrorists (including ex-sailors), of which 2 without using a weapon. Then she lands the perfect plan. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, frightened, but very well composed companion. : D What happens to the responsible leader of the assault / rescue team, having a complete plan (according to the logic of the scripture) about sleep planning - gasping everyone and having someone in his team fly the plane. Only he currently decides to change plans and instead to lead an attack on terrorists, weapons burning, without knowing where the terrorists are or how many, and who do not assure an advantage position, so that his whole team becomes slightly deleted completely. Yes, that uses the old noggin. Only later, decide to use your gas anyway. And it proves to be useless for all intense purposes. The bad thing about this movie was, though, I could not stop to look and wonder, what next? : D I can not imagine that the excellent scriptwriters who think of themselves are not correct. LOL! : D
