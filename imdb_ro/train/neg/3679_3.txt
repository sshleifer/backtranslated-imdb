This is a Japanese movie, but there are quite a lot of English languages ​​here. It's a beautiful movie with beautiful pictures that portray the picturesque beauty of Hawaii. However, this was the only ransom quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to look at a young woman for 90% of the movie because her husband "image" is much older than he announced? Granted, it could be a bummer ...... but get over it! Only in the last 10 minutes he faces one face in front and gets rich with him. Until then, for most viewers, there was little - too late. I've been asleep before then.
