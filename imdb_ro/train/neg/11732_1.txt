IMDb regulations stipulate that you must state whether your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies what causes it, a story about the lost youth who does not know where it's going. > <br /> I saw this at the tribeca film festival. this movie was not just bad, it was very bad. The act is inconsistent, the characters are the most clich√© offers with a little depth, and Farnsworth's role was especially bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the accent of patronizing the uninspired land line to 'outside' charts, dialogue and repetitive scenarios ... blew the big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a kind of "cowboy of pharmacies," updated and updated with a touch of "natural killers," but he is not where he is so sensitive to characters like the former, and not as a shocker (except for one-step gore) as a ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything, someone really needed to A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (There are some things out there to build and clearly <br />) <br /> with a worthy subject ... if it's ham-handed in his attempt.) B) edit the movie. if it was cut to a core, it could be acceptable. <br /> <br /> I would go less than 1 if I could ... maybe maybe zero kelvin.
