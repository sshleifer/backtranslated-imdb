If you study Welles and want to see how far he has fallen after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse to make the protagonist a self-admission dummy to explain how it could fall into such a half-bite scheme fails to explain the court's absurd theaters and the ridiculous upheavals of plot that will appear in the latter. I did not get the big rating of this movie in db like me; all I can guess is that there are many old fans at Welles and Hayworth there.
