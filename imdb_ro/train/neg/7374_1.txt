This is undoubtedly the worst film ever made by Steven Seagal. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the rating, it's too good. This abomination was not even worthy of a rating of 0/10, if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - The worst scenes of action ever, and there are not many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything including himself, including battles, talking (a lot of doubling) and so on. Like always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and can not care less about this movie. Something that is very obvious all the time by taking all the other DTV movies that Seagal has done, multiplying them with each other, multiplying them by a thousand billions, and all the evil you get then, actually describe 1% of this absolute crapfest.
