What a casting wasted. This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. Usually Roger Ebert does not disappoint me, but I feel cheated after seeing this movie. The only emotion is to see Elizabeth banks in her bra. This is a bad statement about this movie. She held so much promise, but it was as if a transvestite had dried out. This is a self-absorbed buzz. I can not express my deep bitterness when I was in this movie, and I hope I can forestall the same disappointment.
