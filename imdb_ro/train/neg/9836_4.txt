John Scott (John Wayne) and Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are friends heading for the rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fairly fair competitor, but he finds that if he is not willing to accept twenty-five cents a dollar in cash awarded by a crooked promoter, he will have to raise his gun earnings. Quite coincidentally, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they would like the rest of the rodeo to take; they shoot the promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make her look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a gag running in the movie where they are about to go to it with their fists over various trivialities. Every time Chandler takes a wild shot, Wayne's foot kicks him up and beats him horribly. If you are very careful, there is a Lipton Tea ad in a scene where Scott's love interest is Anne (Mary Kornman) appears. Later in the movie, friends are once again framed in a scene robbery. With a heart change and seeing the error of his ways, the evil guy Jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him. While broken, Jim tells the story of his doctor and sister, Anne. In an incredible scene, Anne heads straight in the middle of a fight between the good and the bad guy to face the sheriff. "Desert Trail" is one of the blandest John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Productions during this period. Clearly absent are George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both being usually seen in these oats. If you are still a John Wayne fan, you will have to see it once, but it will probably be enough.
