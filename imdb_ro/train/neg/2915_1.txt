It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only five HK policemen, they do not use the gun there, and that makes me feel like a movie by Jacky Chan. All the time they used the gun to turn the attention to the suspect. When I finally use my gun is when I kill each other, what funny movie. In the movie, it's like all the good boys died for no reason. The story line of the movie is also crap, the story jumps here and there and people bored. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is just a kind of OK movie, I think American zombie movie is bloody than it
