I'm sorry about my colleagues in the neighborhood of Nevada, but that's bad. Brian must have had too much botox because he had very few facial expressions in the whole movie. it looked as if it had a tied plate behind it. She was rigid along the film. I watched Alice and Brian and I was surprised to see the extensive biology of work. I would have guessed they were spring students. Ed Asner and Peter Jason took the film frankly with the banter and ease with each line. Ed has not lost his charisma. I wish I met him while he was here. I like snow scenes, shop scenes and church because I was there. I make Nevada City home and look forward to the premiere. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.
