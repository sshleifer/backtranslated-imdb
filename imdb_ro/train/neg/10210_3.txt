It's hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once made the Majesty (1976) majesty and funnier, and now seems to be doing just "through the numbers" of Hollywood thrillers. This is a very easy material from John Grisham, with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a forensic and independent detective, specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo. It's not good when two unbalanced college sickens (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild hunt - planting very intelligent and misleading forensic evidence at the crime scene. Quite right, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create sparkle, we have to survive even more boring, melodramatic flashbacks, illustrating an important event in Cass history. Then, of course, there are frequent photographs of a rock cottage where there is absolutely no doubt that the end of the OTT will be established. Oooh ... the atmosphere. Watch any CIS episode in exchange. It's at the point and much more interesting.
