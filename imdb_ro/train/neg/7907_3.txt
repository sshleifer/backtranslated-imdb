A great performance by Alix Elias highlights a lot of mistakes, otherwise mistaken and confusing. I've seen this movie, perhaps 12 times, and with every run, I find less and less pleasure. Why am I so amazed? Has that ever been explained? Is it a reflection of our own, disorderly life? If so, why not make it more obvious? Why not just turn a mere touch of subtlety that affects this movie and make this connection explicit? Another part of this movie that bothers me no end - motorcycles. The jacket that a small monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest the traveler "on the street." Sunglasses say "cute guy." Still, I'm ready for the Easy Rider to meet Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What is it? Choose the Gremlins series, if you are a fan of the crafty, cracked, reptilian puppets, it will give you the treatment you deserve.
