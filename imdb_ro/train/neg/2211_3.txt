Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - this sums up this movie in one word. What the hell was this "thing", since it might kill me to use the word "movie"?!!!! I hope the director, the writer and the producer did not want to do this, because he certainly did not! A scientist turning his son into a hammer shark and shark killing a bunch of people that scientists have invited to the island! I love this movie so much that when I watch, I laughed in all serious parts, because they were so horn and unprofessional ... and they could not make the shark look more unrealistic, even though this "thing" had a much larger budget than most budget-low movies. All I have to say is watch this movie waiting to laugh at all the bad acts and the stupid dialogue, because if you expect a good movie, I'll be very disappointed.
