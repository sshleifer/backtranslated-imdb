Steven Soderbergh's second half of Che Guevara's revolutionary bio deals with his latest export campaign for the Revolution in Bolivia. To preserve Che Soderbergh's holy visibility, the fools with convenient jumps, the mass executions he presided over after the Cuban revolution, and the madness of his adventure in Congo ("This is the history of a failure," he writes in the preface of his Journal in Congo) to fully focus on Che's attempt to raise support to rise against the Bolivian government. It will prove to be a disaster and Guevara's final act. What suffered the first chapter follows here because Soderbergh slows his film in a crawl to study the contemplative Guevara's beatiful face again played as James Dean in the East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in winning the converts and soon finds himself and his hungry companions being swallowed in the heart of the darkness of the Bolivian jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, the wrath of God, Soderbergh, fails to use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to increase the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned about keeping Ke's head above his head than exploring the panic situation that is on the dead. There is a Herzogian moment in which Che stands on a fierce horse, striking and screaming to make him move, but Soderbergh's general script is still flat, negligent and uninteresting. In both films, Soderbergh shows that he is clearly a Che group and that's why his focus remains short-sighted and narrow. He spends too much time building Che's monument and little to develop his relationships with the main players in his saga, especially with Fidel Castro. Doing things worse, he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never captures the fire. One might think that he was sufficiently animated by Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that table change is much better presented with a sweeping style.
