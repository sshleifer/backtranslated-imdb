When I saw the jewel of Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in college / crocodile niches of exploitation / monster genre. I look forward to a hoarse producer who will follow more successes in these delicate candy of the camp. If only Ed Wood could bring a subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scriptures. With Ed writing the scriptures and a monkey room that creates special crocodile effects on a computer, all we would need would be a rustic chestnut meal Russ Meyer and Ren Hoek's pectoral implants. While Tobe Hooper's crocodile opposite referred to his own films, Blood Surf chose to find a bunch of aged themes in the gallery of other films. See if you can watch Nerd's Revenge sets to find allure / homage / rip-offs at Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones Last Crusade, Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also try to find the fade ready for the TV if the publisher has given up the stock understanding. I was disappointed that he failed to try his tenor with a sotto voice with a soliloquy on greening ... or crowning appreciation, but quasi-captain Ahab of the story does not make his tournament of force. Perhaps, in the coming years, we will see a croc hit after a shot in a golden sunset. Or hope that a monkey will wash a crocky on the toilet of an international cat-space station and enjoy the exploitable waltz of the monkey / cat / crocodile blood spitting. the lack of a whammy bar in surf music irritated me.
