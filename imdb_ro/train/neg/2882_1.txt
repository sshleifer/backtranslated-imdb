This movie is the largest stack of steam in you know, Being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas, I actually know that 90% of the movie was Bogus. Besides the names of some of the victims, nothing else was right. The film seems to have been done with Dad's cam, had filming that I think came from another movie, along with pictures from a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for fun, but because of bad behavior, poorly prepared or non-existent settings, and a very boring and short end. It was a struggle to pursue it to the end. We recommend that you do not waste money on this movie or you will be sorry. crunching
