I like Jane Austin's novels. I like books and movies from Pride, Prejudice, Sensitivity and Sensitivity and are halfway through Mansfield Park. But I could not bear Emma. I gave up the book after two chapters, and by the end of the movie I was not bored less than Emma. It does not seem to change at all. Maybe it worked Paltrows (which is excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy in comparison with Pride and Prejudice by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I gave it 2 in principle because Knightly is bloody and although, because Ewan McGregor is a rather unclear show, I liked singing.
