This is just typical Bruce Willis, action film schtick. Look at some popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. None are realistic. Fights are not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritt's character speak to Willis from DECK OF THE CARRIER? What's up with that? He can not do that inside the ship? Of course, Bruce W. gets a wound of the machete. There are a bunch of average explosions. If this movie exactly represents the SEALS marina, then do not stay stuck in Africa, expecting them to come to save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack in the village bothers me the most. "The front seats are under ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the slaughter that's going on in town. So what does he do? She crawls in the city on her stomach. Yes. How many died while they were around them? Well ... a number of cadres were necessary, I guess. And if that African guy was so important, why did not he enter the helicopter with the elders and the kids? Can he say "Spirit?" Eventually, the movie was very dark. Not just in the plot, but so much at night it was difficult to find out what was going on. Rent it.
