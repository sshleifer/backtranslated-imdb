Due to a boring, non-dimensional script by Neil Simon and a blurry direction from Robert Moore, the second chapter becomes a showcase for Marsha Mason, who received the third of the four Oscar-winning nodes for the Second Chapter, the same performance he gave in Cinnderella Liberty 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only when laughing (81) only this time does not have a child moving around . The second chapter is Moore's third and final feature film, which first directed The Neil Simon, The Detective Cheap (78) and Murder By Death (76). Caan is miscast, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is too analytical and there is almost no detail. The first half is a less exciting love story, which meets cute, between a Caan hammer and a Mason cutter, and the second half of silence makes you replicate in the first half of the century. NYC locations as well as Joe Bologna and a painful thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they offer some welcome distractions. And the last and the least, there is a terrible melody played during the credits.
