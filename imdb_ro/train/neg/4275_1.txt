I do not understand why so many peoples have praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. Now I've seen all season 1 episodes, and seeing season 2 episode 1. I just can not take that show 1) Where is the correct induction in the criminal investigation? In Season 1 there was a scene where Agent Cooper threw stones in a bottle. Can you guess why he did this? He just wants to identify the killer by doing this "joke", while mentioning the supernatural capacity of the Tibetan dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. For example, season 2 began with a "funny" scene that a dumb old man serves Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper sits on the floor. (He's already got his arms in his belly.) This old man does nothing but say stupid comments. That's all. This scene is very dull and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like Hell). I'd read more comic books than see this show more.
