Kidding !!!! Let's have fun with the fact that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just an entry into the "quirk Monday's club" of actors. Indeed, unless it is a satiety of tongue in the cheek, David Mamet - a confused dialogue, diffused alternately in machine speed or in monotone (think of Ben Stein), or a dry comedy; this movie must be on the run for a round tomato prize - or worse. As if Posey was not enough, we have nothing to do with it, we have a heavier and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There's more wood in this movie than a tooth factory. Adding to this already bizarre casting, there are some other roles, all populated by forgotten actors who look or sound like escapees from America's next model, Don Pardo or even the child who pronounces the word "was" like "beans," which attract us attention to the fact that there is not so little about this movie, we analyze its focus to guess if it is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed in the heart in places that should be serious and I took seriously sections that should be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans' music for Mamet's "House of Gaming". If taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll; if taken seriously, only a piece of self-conscious drek.
