I came to NEW PORT SOUTH waiting for a surrogate film about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide that said a sociopathic indictment against the system gave me that but this is a very boring movie if it happens a little, so you think you are cautioned The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to hit back what he feels to be an authoritarian regime. The major issue is that the character is subscribed, and the actor who plays it, Blake Shields, is not capable of embellishing any script deficiency. You have the feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never meets like another dissatisfied adolescent, and it is impossible to believe that any disciple might rally. The subtext of overthrowing a manipulative authoritarian regime, just to replace it with another manipulative regime, is too obvious, meaning "NEW PORT SOUTH" is a totally unbelievable drama that does not deserve to get out of your way of seeing
