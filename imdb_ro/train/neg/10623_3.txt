"Three Bold Daughters" is a sweet, rosy color, divorce, remarriage, and single parent. Obviously, social problems and economic hardships have no place in the perfect life of a single parent who feels exhausted, has a cruise, and then gets married and marries a band conductor. Even when "just a movie" excuses the scenario of addressing real-life problems, "Daughters" suffers from too many incoherent songs, children whose personalities are not based on true children and the leader of Hose Iturbi. Is not it strange that any real person would play in a movie in which their real self is supposed to marry? <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was released in the '90s. Only love for the old style of romance and comedy in Hollywood could make the "daughters" a tolerable film.
