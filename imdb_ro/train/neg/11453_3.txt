This movie is one of the most serious comedy films I've ever seen. I hate these deviations from Napoleon Dynamite. Just to face people humor humor has already been mastered. Do something new for one time. All these new comedies are just horrible. And coming out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not yet ready for a lead role. I hope he can come back from this dreadful movie. And Will Arnetts' character is simply bad. Hey Will, you read the script. The plot is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if it's weird. (this is the movie) Frank Kimble's father is dead and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans this huge leap to raise money for Frank. Only for Rod to be able to beat Frank in a fight and prove his man. Yeah, that's the movie, you tell me, u would spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of nonsense! 3/10 just horrible <br /> <br /> -adam
