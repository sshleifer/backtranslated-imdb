I can not believe this movie was made so recently in 1984. It has some ridiculous actions, not to mention one of the most stupid plots ever. Who would ever ask the Texas sun, Joe Don Baker, to escort an Italian he illegally detained in Mexico in Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you nothing about it - in fact, it is a generic title for a wannabe / cop, as I can think. glad I just saw this on MST3K with Mike and the robots as a shield. They note the similarity of female lead with Elaine in Seinfeld ("None of these are increased) and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This movie is probably no worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation is certainly ahead of him: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I'd like to be illiterate, so I should not have read this . "
