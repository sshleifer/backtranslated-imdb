I've been thinking about Harvey Keitel, a fresh-hearted young man from Sex Pistols John Lydon, then Ennio Morricone's music bonus. I was expecting a thriller of the early age school police that was done in America. Istead, I have a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that let me say: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions, not enough action. The result: a classic worship was washed in the toilet. Keitel and Lydon are working well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring these guys together with a better script. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. Overall, not a waste of time, but not a "must see" unless you are a Keitel hardcore fan.
