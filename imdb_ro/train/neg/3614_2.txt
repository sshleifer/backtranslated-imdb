A schizophrenic escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York, and soon teachers began to go to St. Louis University. Trinity. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the red herring mess. Despite a running time of 78 minutes, this cheap slasher draws and continues until the blade ends in which the suspected person is the starting killer is revealed as being. Director Richard Haines barely absorbs a sweat, with a lame-n-slash scene, but he shows that the audience of the 80's was probably a wish. For all of our amateur anthropologists, this movie was filmed at New Yawk in the early 1980s, so you can check the entire culture, beliefs and practices of people living in that distant place. The film has no credit to bring out the "Final Girl". Rarely see this. Also, it's always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Do not trust clergy in my beloved movie industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest and he is caught. The moral ground angle is still working.
