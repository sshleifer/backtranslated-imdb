I am a great fan of the Italian films of the seventies and I will not hesitate to mention the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I entered this film with some hope. However, it soon becomes evident that this is a largely useless film that will not go anywhere. Clearly no one would go into this by waiting for much more, but the fact that this is useless becomes more annoying when you think it is rather boring and none of the characters is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a "dishonest"; in this case, one who steals, calls and smuggles. This is basically all the plot this movie has. The film has a true style of seventy and the idea that everything is very worried is getting better. It seems that sometimes directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson are trying to get over a certain point, though this does not happen very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and this is the case here too; she is definitely the best thing about the movie and the sequence in which she gets stuck in an empty car is the best part of the movie. On the whole, The Rogue will probably appeal to those who love the style of the seventies, but unfortunately has nothing else to offer.
