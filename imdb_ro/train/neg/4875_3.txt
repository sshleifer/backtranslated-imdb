My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when she came to theaters in 1998 and we happily bought the tickets, the popcorn and the siphon and we headed for the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it's over, the audience did not applaud strongly, I remember hearing a few people say they do not like it at all, I did not like it, I thought it was bad enough and it's not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical about this, but besides him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at this side, and I reminded myself that the other people in the theater almost laughed. And what I really thought was bad was the conversation of the animals, because the talking animals exist only in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally mutt! I said that, besides Eddie Murphy's hysterical controversy, he brings, this movie is not worth watching, it's pretty bad. I saw Eddie Murphy in several movies, and I thought it was funny for those who just said it was the only fun part of this movie, and I did not see Eddie Murphy in the really " great, "Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie that I would really recommend to see, because, besides Eddie Murphy, you probably do not like that, especially because of the animals talking in it! <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.
