I have to change my mind because I'm watching this movie until it's really painful. An incapable painter becomes a successful man fully capable? This movie was full of absurdities, of which, if I had remembered it all, I would give the film. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a routine to have agreed to make this film. The acting was deplorable, and the story was even worse. As a reasonable and rational person, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this film. It was an ineptitude from every main character, there were a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. An absurd act after another, with dialogue, does not make a movie, it's just a wreck of the train.
