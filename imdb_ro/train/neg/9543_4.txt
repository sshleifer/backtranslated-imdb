Let's admit ... if you rented a sequel to the STDVD of a forgotten 80-piece jewelry and you waited for it to be better than the ones mentioned above, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Such films do not need spoilers because you already know them. The "plot" for this film is as follows: Nerd meets with the girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes the girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; the nerd and the girl end up being persecuted by governments in the other state; nerd and girl meet an old dying old who dies at the key point of "film"; nerd and girl are captured; the Top Secret Government computer becomes mad; nerd is committed to computer secret top secret government; nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer in the first movie "Wargames"; nerd saves the day; Nothing is put. <br /> <br /> The end. Scenario, scenario, effects, score and cinema are what you would expect at B-grades. Some familiar faces are here, and if you're not a fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid that. Granted, the movie will not make you crazy enough to eat your own fingers, seeing it, so if you like cheap STDVD sequences, then you are at home. Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was too involved in a "masterpiece," that he could not even make a five-second cousin in this. But can you blame him?
