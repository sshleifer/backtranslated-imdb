I'd rather have 20 more radical channels than to go through this movie again. The annoying prince, Myles Berkowitz, lost nearly two hours of my life with this cynical pseudo-cold play. The only fun thing about this disorder is Mr. Samaha's indefinable story about breasts and ass. Berkowitz takes a wonderful concept and thickens it in the dust. It is tangled and badly done, in an apparent effort to make it look nervous or funny. There is none. Rarely I feel that a movie was a waste of film (or tape), but it qualifies for this distinction. If once you suggest to watch this movie, run.
