The worst film on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a sex-free sex porn. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and it could not have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. The film must have recorded a record budget, which is sure it was almost exclusively scattered on the cover of the film. This movie has now become a joke in progress with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other garbage films. I would like to mention that no other film starts to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to a friend and myself to watch this movie and I am surprised that I still consider myself a friend after the torment I have put. Do not see this movie!
