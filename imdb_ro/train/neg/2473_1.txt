if my grandfather had made movies, he would probably make a figure much better than that ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are all right. Especially, my mother is a beautiful actress and the baby turns out to be a beautiful one, especially on scenes that are supposed to be scary. But the director knows the meaning of Plot Point, Triller, and Good Script. the script has no evolving atmosphere to become suspense. If you like to be watched by trees, you can probably enjoy it, otherwise you just stay home and sleep. oh ... Actually it was funny: the movie has been since 2001, but we did not realize that the picture is so bad (just like the mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80).
