Gwoemul (Host) - Because of the pollution in the Han River, a mutant beast is on the ramp. The youngest member of the Park family is kidnapped by the beast and it is up to the rest of the family to find her before she becomes the final table of the beast. First of all, I love monster movies: Moving Bears, big-sized aligators, packets of drab Komodo dragons, the whole lot. The features of the creature are my favorite horror movie type. So, I really wanted to like my host, but it was not. <br /> <br /> There were three major problems with this: <br /> <br /> The first one can be seen with a quick glance at IMDb's page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many goddamn genres. It was too serious to be a comedy, but it was still too easy to have a true message (though it seems to try to make a statement, anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-governmental). The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confused mish-mash with all the other styles. Secondly, after the initial monster attack, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family is wandering around to look for one, while the governments of Korea and America apparently do nothing. And that is, they just wander, sometimes hitting each other, probably for a little comedy relief. This lack of action attracted my attention, and obviously did the same for the director, because the whole plot of the plot goes unresolved (a plague of mystery invented by bad Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). And, finally, the film is crowded with politics. It pains Americans as bad and bad, but it does not give us American characters with more depth than a cartoon bastard. The opening scene has the most obvious foolishness to the Korean American moment. With a Korean morgue assistant, who asks his boss, the foreman, not to spill chemicals into the Han River. However, the American lawyer does not deal with the maniac because he orders the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, it is a lazy film and there is no excuse for it. Plus, the monster is good, a mixture of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some motion effects are pretty cool, and the original monster of the park is very fun. There are also some beautiful photos in the movie. Some of these strangely remind me of the way Firefly has been filmed (chambers of shaking, fires, etc.). There is also a beautiful scene at the end of the year, in which the hero and a little boy he saved are in the family food store family. It's night night and snow is falling, the street lamp is to give a cool light, but the power stand has a warm light coming from it. In general, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a decent movement of creatures and, in turn, I have a pseudo-politics, a comedy of horror. Looking at the comments about IMDb, I can not believe that if it were an American production, it would have been planned. Just because it's a foreign movie does not mean it's good. In recent years, there have been some extraordinary movies in Korea (The Trilogy of Revenge and, for example, the Brotherhood), but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once, I'm in favor of a remake. Tighten your targeting, improve your scripts and it could be a nice movie. As it is, it does not deserve a few hours from someone's time.
