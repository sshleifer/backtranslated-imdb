This film virtually destroys the talents of each actor in what might be best called "potboiler". Despite the fact that "Top Gun" has been opened, everything is descended from there, with lots of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke on popcorn. There are so many dead story lines in this movie that I guess at one time it was made by assembling a series of thrown television. Quinn's physician-Mexican role is ridiculous, and his "associates" were immediately snapped from a Quinn-Martin police show in 1970. Costner's character is wooden and does not give us any reason to believe that he actually fell in love with Mendez's wife. We are not even convinced that I thought the wife suffered from the company and that I would jump the first hot body that came along. Surely a "B" movie at best and a huge loss of time for all involved.
