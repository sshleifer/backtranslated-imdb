Not only has the script been made with the ease in which the two psychologists can kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat, but it was a terrible blow to Misery. However, the main reason I gave this film such a low rating was that it absolutely disgusted me. There is someone slightly shocked by what filmmakers are producing and who have always had a love for horror but this film has gone too far simply in terms of violence and torture just to get points in the shock factor. I think most people, when they see only the first ten minutes of "hide and seek", will get to the remote.
