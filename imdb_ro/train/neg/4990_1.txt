I can enjoy a nice guilty blow, but that's just bad. And it's not bad in a way that you can enjoy seeing MST3K to have fun with it. It's just bad that you can not find anything to enjoy it no matter how hard you try. I really regret to lose 2 hours of precious life on this stupidity. You can tell him that nobody was asked to act and that everyone knew that this movie would only bury their career. It seems that Walking Tall has earned enough income that someone has decided that they could make an investment. If it's not the worst movie I've seen, it's so bad that the worst movies in my memory have been deleted.
