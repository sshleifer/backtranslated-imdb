Nell Shipman attempted a plot to reach a final trail in "Back to God's Land" from the previous year, and she failed in misfortune. This time, she does better, though it seems useless. "Something New" hardly has a plot out of search. There is a brief premise that creates the hero (Shipman's co-author and friend) having to save a girl (played by Shipman), then it is nothing more than an exciting and implausible pursuit there. Of course, she behaves like an hour's ad for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is congruently ridiculous. He does not seem to have learned much from D.W. Griffith or his parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which he imitates. A point of interest is that Shipman writes and goes into the film as a writer of the film's story, which has as protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although she does nothing else intelligent or humorous with her, even if she tries to . Again, others have pioneered the writer's jokes in the intertitle, such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "The Face of a Girl" (both 1917). At least, Shipman has the impression that he does not take seriously or the film seriously - and I "new", despite his allegations, is hackneyed.
