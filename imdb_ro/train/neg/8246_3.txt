Dad's little girls, Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West, get some extraordinary news at the local post office, not knowing they're being watched by the breaker Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from the young Robert Harron), which requires his father to leave; so when young women come back, can they be? home alone. As a vulnerable nightclub pair, "Grand Ball of the Black and Tans" is in full swing; and a closed skin drinker presents an additional danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> <br /> Inslee has one of the best roles of his Biographer, filming "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced Extracters at the "Negru and Tans" Ball. "Lawrence and the West Biographical Girls" are suggestive of later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and, they are overly affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, since the story of a redeemed thief by saving his potential victims from greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dad (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
