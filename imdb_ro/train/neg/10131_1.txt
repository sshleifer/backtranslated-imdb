Well, I can put the question once and for all aside: "What's the worst movie ever done ... ever?" It's "Flight of Fury," with Steven Seagal. Of course there are a lot of bad movies, but that takes the cake by being so serious. It is a Romanian film that speaks only to what extent Romania has to go to Bollywood. He also talks about how utterly lacking in intellect and talent has become Steven Seagal. This movie is so bad that you feel literally raped after watching it and you have to sit in the corner of the shower and weep, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. It was released only on the video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the workers who had to do the DVDs had to wear protective equipment and receive regular counseling.
