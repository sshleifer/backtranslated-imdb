And that's all it is. This is slow. Actors have skills, they do not seem motivated to make the effort. The plot is not so large and is still constrained by the slowdown mentioned above. The accents, when they exist, are British. Many of these people should be Danish. OK, OK, the accents are not so important. But the tongue is. I do not think they used words like "yes" and "OK" on Beowulf's day. And the cold gun that his king gave him? Has he recharged that thing? Has she ever seen her? Or was Beowulf just an evil end? His goal was at least equal to the computer graphics used to generate the monsters. They were rather stopped. Poor special effects. Bright spot? Only one I can think of. Marina Sirtis has resisted over the years.
