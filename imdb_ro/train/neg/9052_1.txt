I respect that this is a very popular show. However, compared to Robert Altman's classic, ingenious, hilarious, fun and revolutionary film 1970, this performance was probably intended to be less than mediocre ... even if it had worked for 11 years, what does not necessarily mean something. This show was a part of my early childhood (it was resumed every night and guess whose parents followed and laughed), but it is one of the memories they do not lack. And now that I've seen the movie, I can give you a lot of right criticism. On its own, there is almost no "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they are just similar in name. For example, since is Alan Alda something like Donald Sutherland? His style of humor is totally different, as well as his characterization and perspectives. The new characters are not so great; they only serve to make you lose those you replace. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, which (even if interpreted by the same actor) is just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yes. With a laughing track (no matter if used in surgical scenes or not), it happens to be creepy because of what's happening in other regions. And because it lasted almost four times more than the current Korean war, it is necessary for spectators to make this bizarre temporal rupture that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I never liked this show and I will never do it.
