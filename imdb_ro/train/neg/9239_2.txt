Heavenly Days make a serious comedy: you are desperate to teach a civic lesson and will not stop until we pass the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly make a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have an apology with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get familiar with the handsome annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on a train that reads a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace! A year later, he was considered a communist bummer, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add some really horrible musical moments, a lot of hooey pavilion and a boring submarine about newspaper reporters and you have a movie that should have Philip Wylie ready to create Vipers Generation 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically unfun, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the Devil has all the best songs.
