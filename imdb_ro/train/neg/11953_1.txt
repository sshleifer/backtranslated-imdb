Do you know those movies that caught you in the cinema? You are stuck there in the best place in the house, in the center of your row in your own special sweet spot that you have changed three times before you have only the right place - and after 13 hours you are trapped, discomfort and itching , thinking "When the movie F *** is the movie ever finished?" (You know the feeling - think about AI and the village). Well, visitor Q offers a strange version of that feeling. I stayed there for the first 30 minutes, asking me when it was supposed to start! It is endless! So "Arty" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've ever watched. Looks like he's doing dozen movies, and if they're all pretentious like that, I guess it'll be the last one. I am not against the pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is there among the top 10 directors for me, but Visitor Q is pretentious, cheap and ugly pretentious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you probably have worked so far, I hated it.
