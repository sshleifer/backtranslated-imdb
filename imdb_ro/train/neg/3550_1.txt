I'm leading a group to stop exploiting the comedian, and just spent the last two months listening to the horror stories from comedies who tried to hear about "Last Comic Mode." If they do not have a good agent then they do not even have the chance to make a hearing so that more than 80% of returning comedies are rejected before they can show they have the talent! If I did it at an audition, she was told she was "pre-determined" if she had a second chance. So what TV viewers are NOT the best comic strip in the US. If comics do this, then most do not receive IMDb credits. I know this because I made the credits for all six Seasons of Last Comic Standing and I do not pay because I work for the producers. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked "The Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why manufacturers do not give IMDb credits and I was banned from the Facebook page! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have a personal stake in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see anyone exploited and that's why I helped the comedians. Comedies are being exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a THREE network, so those responsible for themselves are ashamed to allow this exploitation to happen. comedian who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
