For example, there was only one blow in the secret life of dentists in the dentist who could have expressed the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph scattered it. The room is in the hall, looking through the doors of the two dental offices, Dana and Dave being alone in their respective rooms. You have the idea of ​​their desolation and isolation, but not much more. Illumination, colors, body language, facial expressions could have been greatly improved. If I had guided, I would have spent all day, if necessary, to get that right shot. This is the beauty and power of the movie: it can be expressed so much, of whole lives, in a matter of seconds. The photo of the child who is climbing the puddle could have been improved. The child should have been more fascinated with puddles, he should have crashed his legs, he should have taken his head down to watch the puddle with all his attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not give birth. He plays an unusual, real person, but instead of conveying his inner disorder in voice, gesture, body movement, the film is based on the storytelling and dialogue with his imaginar macho alter-ego played by Denis Leary.
