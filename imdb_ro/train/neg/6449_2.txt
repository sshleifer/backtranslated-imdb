Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty characters of character whose characters are all impossible to accomplish and an iguana lizard that follows them and you have an idea of ​​the madness here. On the positive side, the film does not get out of monsters. There are no photos or images during the night when you have to imagine what it looks like; he is right there folks. Unfortunately, design and construction are not inspired. A bit of mystery could have helped. Remember, I've seen much worse, but if you put him on a walk, for a long shot, your monster would look better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is a twist that ends with the alleged dead brother who has absolutely no meaning. That was not a surprise, given the brilliant writing of the script. In terms of acting; well, let's say it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect to see many of these children in future cinemas. Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nobody: 1 out of 5; Intelligence: Negligible
