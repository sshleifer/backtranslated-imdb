This was a disappointing horror movie about a young girl and her nightmares. For a horror film or "thriller" and hype, it's too shy. There are only a few tense moments here, not everywhere, as close to what it would have been for a film of this kind. Even those "tense" scenes were not too many. Music has made them more dramatic than they actually were. There are a lot of symbols here, so the elitist critics label it the horror film of a man of thought. Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion that I've made a losing money at the video rental store. Summary: A yawner that offers inappropriate lead and generally poor. Very overrated and certainly not what is announced.
