This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be vicious and shocking; but the FURNISHING of the masses is not a blade, but some of the rigid legged zombies that cross the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is reduced by government-run newspapers and television stations. Some courageous but stupid souls at Channel 5 TV News feel that the audience is given false hope and no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An eager reporter (Rachel Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risks life and memory displaying a live show to show the doom at hand. Do yourself a favor and do not look. This is obviously a very low budget and it happens with the sense of a bad high school game. The action is atrocious, and the hungry zombies of the meat are almost comic. Also featured are: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FOOD SUPPLEMENT must be left to starve.
