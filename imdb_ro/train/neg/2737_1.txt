There is no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to spoil. No plot, nothing; most of the clips show at least trying to bind the clips in a plot of a certain stretch, but this did not even do that. Videos, three lines leading to the next endless sequence of boring clips ... Okay, maybe they were short during production, but it would have been better to skip this whole episode. What a waste of time. I'm not sure how this was actually done. Scrubs is usually much better off under the tropes, but in a way this has caught .... Thanks to the skies were back on the form by the next episode.
