I really do not want to write this review. I am a Christian, so I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It seemed wonderful to me - a Christian movie with pretty famous stars and a plot that seemed interesting (not that I buy the Bible Code itself - you can say everything you want, but I believe everything in the Bible). So I'm sitting on the edge of the chair enjoying the preview, when the movie lights up and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible writing and the actors while I was in the theater (I would have been broken into pieces by the people who applauded on rather clumsy scenes, but essentially uplifting and blinking outright and Predictable Tension Scenes, I'm sure). Once the final credits began to roll, I could still reflect. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some unexpected, unexpected breaks, some effects that were really special (we do not count the visions, these are badly made) and some interesting technical works - fade, the guy For work. Unfortunately, I have the impression that if I read the apocalypse of a monkey and put a monkey in front of a writing machine for an hour, I could have gotten a better scenario. And music was beyond the noise (even for a Bond fan who likes raw music in action scenes and intrigue). I would like to be like everyone else in the theater - like those who have been crying and breathing because of incredible - but there is someone who can be quiet by a writer who throws a few words on a Bible Shield and a Christian Stamp. I need a good plot and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and this simply did not have one. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When will we see a clever Christian fiction? It has to be somewhere ...
