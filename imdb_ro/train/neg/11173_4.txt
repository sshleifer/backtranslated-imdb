If it was not for bad dialogues and scenarios. I mean the direction was really related to the subject. The actors were doing well to bring their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that really was missing was a solid scenario to keep all the pieces together. I would very much suggest not to look at it. Unless you are an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and I will watch all that plays. Even if the result is quite poor lately. This is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad film for this actor who once knew how to choose the roles.
