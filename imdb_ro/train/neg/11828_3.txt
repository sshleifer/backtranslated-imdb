A few months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this film. The poster insisted that if I had a "Flushed Away" chance, I would like it. Based partly on this argument, I accepted to see the movie. "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least from Aardman), but he does not have the strength to shoot him together. His best asset is the rat / boat driver Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the main character of the film instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his time on screen. One of the things that bother me most about "FA" is repeating jokes that are not funny to start with. When Roddy is trapped, the movie makes sure he's hit five times at once. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, who then electrocuted Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gouts involving pain is at a low point. I will not waste time to eat Katzenberg's kleptomaniatic tendencies towards Pixar (A similar movie is a coincidence, five is a rupture) but I will say I'm disappointed by Aardman. They can do (and have done) much better. Try harder next time, guys.
