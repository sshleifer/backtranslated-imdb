This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I have seen in a very long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I was going to try one after the other: a bad mistake. The film should show how Sam's son killed real life in a neighborhood in the summer of 1977; what really made was the center around the most boring characters that I doubt someone cared about their drug problems, marriage issues, and so on. Scenes describing crimes are just like that and nothing more; a shooting and then return to Saturday Fever! Which is even more ridiculous is Spike Lee's choice to be featured as a reporter in the movie: Spike, believe me, you're not Hitchcock, stand out of the movies, it's even worse. The foolish scene had to be the singing in a terrible voice, which was described in a scene in front of which she should have been shot ??? Spike, what were you thinking about when you made this movie? I do not think at all. People who think they will see a crime scene, take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser. You better look at Jerry Springer in this case! Film waste, I gave it 1 out of 10: terrible dick.
