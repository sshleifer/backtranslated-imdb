This is the biggest piece of carp ever. It seems that they spent more time, effort and money making the DVD cover than they did in the real movie. I really thought the DVD was off with someone porn until I recognized one of the actors on the cover. This movie looks like someone did it with a hundred dollars and a video camera and spent half of that on the rats. The picture is really clear, but with the very unfortunate illumination, cinema, if you can call it this, the production, the action, if this is actually what the scenario does, if one has one, makes this movie look worse than porno porno. At least the old porn has a point. It seems that some PETA members have come together and have decided to make a truly disturbing and useless PSA on the rights and feelings of animals. That's not worth the money or the time. It has nothing to do with the BTK serial killer, other than the name of the killer and some of the victims. The people who made this film should be glad they are not yet free, or could have come after them just because they stabbed this movie so badly.
