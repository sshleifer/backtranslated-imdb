Now, I like SF cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably frightened. Characters are generic and stereotyped (READ must make an African-American man wear tiger-type clothing and speak with a jamiac accent?) Why do all the Asian characters vibrate yellow and shine? Mother must have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) To the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, rude and sometimes disturbing. There are similarities, even the left, to Astro Boy. Let me explain (dub the name for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay. Short resemblance to "My Life as a Teenager Robot," "Star Wars," "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and co. I'm out. Not to mention racial stereotypes / abundant sex. Do not even let me down. I will say they are hidden and dirty. But, seriously. Do not even try to follow this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
