A patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his custodians and then a university professor after he goes to the local college. The next semester, the replacement of the late teacher and a new group of students have to face a new batch of crimes. The dialogue is so clich√© that it is hard to believe that I could predict the lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap movies that were thrown together in the middle of the 80s slash era. Despite the heroine killing, this is just a substandard junk. Horror acts, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horror! "Splatter University" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, though I suggest you watching your head cleaner tape, which would be more fun. Jump over it and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. R Rated for Powerful Graphic Violence, Profanity, Short Nudity and Sexual Situations.
