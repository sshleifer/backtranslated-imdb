Andrewjlau, we could not agree. My girlfriend is following this at this moment and I find this horrible movie. Quote by my Chinese girlfriend, laughing, "They do everything for a man!" <br /> <br /> I think these women have no intensity, no sense of the struggle between tragedy and identity, and these people do not deserve to fight for it. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins, men look worse than admiration. The Japanese people have much more intensity than the Chinese, and geisha is a Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese have something similar, but the faces do not fit the main ones. However, the dialogue is so insensitive, so American. If a European would do it with European orientals, it would have done a much better job. I have to add: it seems that most of the people who liked the film are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All were presented to you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are wonderful, but I can not say they are good actors in this movie. Yes, the cinema is great, but I really do not see how it can be seen that these characters are complex and deep people. I'm going to Japan to see the real things. I'm sure it would be amazing to see.
