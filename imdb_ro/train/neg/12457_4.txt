It seems that Salvatores could not decide what to do with this movie: part of it is a very poor thriller (and I say very, very poor), part of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried out in psychological thrillers, but in this case the film can not keep things together because of poor, superficial scriptures, bad acts, and a cinema too dark and too dull. I would say that Salvatores has done the best in other genres and other regions where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. Overall, a B movie is hardly worth the money ... Vote: 4/10
