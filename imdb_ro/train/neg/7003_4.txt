(alias: TRINITY IS YET MY NAME) It seems that this sequel has been made to capitalize on the success of the European box office at The Call of Trinity, but this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy wanted to capitalize on it in America as well. It's a shame they did not get too far, since Hill / Spencer's photos were just marginal here in the US, and the movie mostly boring and drawn does not help anyone. Trinity and Bambino swear to their dead father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful winners and take care of each other. Later, they get involved with arms dealers who throw weapons from a monastery and who think they are a pair of federal agents. Everything is happening, despite some funny scenes, especially if Trinity and Bambino are in a French restaurant and do not know how to behave. And the shark scenes were humorous. The music release song by Gene Roman sounds like a movie piece Bobby Goldsboro in the early 1970s, while the musical songs sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. I'm not sure if I'd like to buy his sound CD, but others could. The film might have been half an hour hit by it and would not drag it for so long. It looks like a lot of landscapes are chewed here. Actually, I lost interest in 2 / 3rds. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant buzz in the soundtrack and a poor print that seems to have been sent to that big heap of debris in the sky. A big step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
