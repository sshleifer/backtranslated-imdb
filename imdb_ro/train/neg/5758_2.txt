You might say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves the statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this movie have nothing to face. They play the role of cardboard bites that are predictable and uninteresting. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but I will stop if someone who reads wants to see this movie. I had to quickly make the parts where Jack showed us how to be an unpleasant nourishment. I would say that 70% of this film revolves around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I'd rather not spend my time looking at Jack to drink loudly with an open mouth. Personally, I could have done without references and jokes for footwear that made the first half of the movie. Apart from my personal dementia, the movie did not deserve to be the right time. There were countless scenes and photos that felt like they were moving. When something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. It is best not to look at this.
