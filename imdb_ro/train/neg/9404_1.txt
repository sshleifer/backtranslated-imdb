This absolute garbage relies so tightly on Friday the 13th series, which is basically a carbon copy, it accepts because it is an Australian film with people who can not act. Once a boy was accidentally burnt while shooting a video at Lake Eildon. Now, a few years later, the boy is growing up and taking revenge on somebody who comes to the lake to shoot a music video. It is missed by the clich√© and a waste of time and money, you can only see it out of curiosity or if you are an aspiring actor who is trying to learn how to (can not) act. Lead the role of Alan Dale used to play in the Neighbors TV series, but arrived in The X Files - how did this happen?
