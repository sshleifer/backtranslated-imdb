He watched 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): The Mystery of Comedy Crime Corny with very few laughs. The film seems to be based on an earlier Italian film, according to credits, but was re-written by two American writers of fairly popular romantic comedy. But this by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not reduce her compared to other efforts. The story relates to a couple of Americans traveling on a lost dog and Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who hope to make a fortune in money after seeing an ad in the dachsund return newspaper. After trying to get back, I see a hand coming out of a garage door at the lady's residence, which I think is attached to the rest of the woman's body that should give her the money. They are frightened and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth, they behave like scene fugitives who expect to be framed. The other characters in the movie are met in a train before that and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling station that does a lot of things to be shot in the story. Other cast members include actors such as John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. Once the police learn about death, they begin to question the main characters and, of course, they have to work through their wicked lies to find out what really happened. None of the aforementioned characters can bring this movie out of the mood, despite some funny moments most of the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a terrible movie, it just is not that good. There are a lot of ordinary movies out there and this is another for the pile. Try it, maybe you'll like it, you probably will not.
