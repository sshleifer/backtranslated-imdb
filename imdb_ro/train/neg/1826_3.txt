I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers, the only giggle that came out of my movie was when I realized I was actually watching. In a word, it is unpleasant. Unfunny. I totally believe that trivia is rumored that Jack does not apologize for making this garbage. I can not believe that Barry Levinson did not just throw this scenario when he read the front page. Besides, I can not believe I watched more than ten minutes of it. I gave her 3 out of 10 * because I like to see Christopher Walken making awful movies for salary. also the horse "corky" by simply living as a character in this movie is actually quite ridiculous.
