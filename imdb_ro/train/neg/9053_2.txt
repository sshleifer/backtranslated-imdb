I just found the TV show "Mash" tortured, preaching, oh so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and the greatest sin of all, and that is it? that is (it was) incredibly boring. You have Alan Alda as the leading star, "(the star)," who is so in love with himself and his intelligence that it made me feel uncomfortable even trying to stay in an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I will gladly admit to having presented a certain style of style. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both singly and composing together, are like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which we also found boring, also without her fault, was not a miracle to look at, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie, was tired of looking and playing the show. Seeing a show a year, he showed me that. Jamie Farr was just a "comedy" of the leaves, and it is not even worth mentioning here. The reason why I did not give a rating (one) that anyone reading now would have been surprised that rating of any kind is not only a subjective, but a relative call. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is so bad. In other words, Mash had a certain quality of production (according to television standards) of that era and today and therefore deserves two. Rob Ritter
