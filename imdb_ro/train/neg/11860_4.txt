If you have not figured out what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She stayed too long on the shelf and wants to burst. She has a teenage daughter who only points out that she does not receive any younger child. As she checks her daughter, she discovers a world she never dared ... cabaret, where she can dance on her belly in sequins, while men throw money. The film is very misogyny. It's the portrayal of men is bitchy. Which is odd enough for Lilia to juggle for her, not for money, but for the hell. When she manages to awaken her, she makes her feel like a woman again. He does not want to connect with them, but he's dependent on attention. The other dancers are mostly elderly women who look like men in love and realize their time in the limelight is short-lived. Not quite briefly say. She finds romance, no matter how short, you have guessed .... There have been no surprises here. Although the end is good, you realize that it could not have ended otherwise. Maybe this movie just does not target my demographics
