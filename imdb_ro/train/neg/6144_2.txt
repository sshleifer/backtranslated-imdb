Ironically, though he can do "splitting," Thomas is a complete rigid actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is moved in my memory as one of the most naked and less incompetent films I've ever seen. As such, I really like more. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason why this becomes more than a star is that Thomas is a wonderful form and it's fun to see his small and muscular body performing various physical gymnastics facts on the strange scattered rocks and poles about the country of Eastern Europe (including the infamous "head of a bloody head" in the middle of a village market that Thomas uses to plant his feet on the faces of mad villagers) . But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emulate and any illusion that he could have a film career is shattered right away. <br /> <br /> At least he had the excuse that he was not really an actor. All others in the movie - actors, directors, editors, room guys, etc. are at least as bad or even worse and most are professionals. So Kurt does not get as bad as you thought. <br /> <br /> I hope Kurt took the money and ran away. If someone ever asked him to play again in a martial arts movie, I bet that Thomas hits the front man.
