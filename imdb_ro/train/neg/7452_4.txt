For me, the movie seemed to fall over. The main problem for me was casting Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if this will increase from ploying or simply to his behavior, but I doubt that Glover might ever present a convincing bastard. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performance. Besides the fact that the movie is being run by the story of serial killers. Nothing very innovative.
