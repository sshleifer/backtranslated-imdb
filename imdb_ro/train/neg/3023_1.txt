It's rare to meet a movie so horrible, annoying and irritating. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot, when it's not a confusing and pointless editing, is ridiculous. Why did the Domino become such a wretch? Because her golden fish died when he was a child, and this "traumatic" event left him excited and hated everybody. When the dialogue is not clich√© or banal, it is filled with ridiculous lines like: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and all the others." At one time bounty hunters have a guy tied behind their bus, which has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confused telephone call, instead of breaking his sleeve and reading the number, he threw his arm with a rifle. In other news, bounty hunters take a bomb at a mafia meeting and threaten to put the bomb away unless the mafia let them go! Clearly not going to the meeting would have been too easy. Keira Knightley is not convincing and terribly mischievous. Mickey Rourke manages to save some credibility from this mess. I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance being one, but all I could think was, while suffering this disturbance, that it must have been made by a complete idiot.
