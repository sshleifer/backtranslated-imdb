I wonder if there is any sense in this movie. It's a big joke. Okay .. It's fun. You got to see the stupidest parcel played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which audience group this movie is actually oriented towards. Prieta (a professional) plays a surrogate mother for a happy Salman / Rani couple who wants a baby but can not. I wonder what if this drama would be a real take-off of a real couple's life. Rani appears happy with another beautiful lady in her house who was brought to make a baby for her and Salman. She cares about Priety and tries to push her husband, Salman, to Preity, to have a love story. When the audience is stolen from Salman's nakhras. Although it is a good past, this film is unbearable. Absurd.
