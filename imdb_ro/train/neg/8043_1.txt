Normally, I have no problem removing myself from a bad movie, but that was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually stood by the whole thing almost praying that it will have a good movie minute to justify an hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Situated at a beach house where a group of college friends celebrates a holiday, this film suffers from many problems that are not worth seeing. First, there are field holes. Second, very few from the C list (I do not even dare call them B), the actors can act in reality, so any scenarios that have the potential fail at all. Thirdly, the film rate is very disturbing and difficult to track most of the time, which makes the suspense construction very difficult, resulting in very few surprises for the audience. Fourthly and most importantly, the end is partly anticlimatic, due to the way it ends (establishing / who is the killer) and partly because the dialogue is just atrocious. For the movie, it's the only movie I'll ever say is the worst movie I've ever had and I've seen a lot. So, as a bad joke, you would have been happier not to hear, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret that you will cry, you do not really do as you run in the opposite direction.
