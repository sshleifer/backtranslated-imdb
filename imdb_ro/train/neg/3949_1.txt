We received a Bogeyman DVD and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was associated with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": make an "assassin" of "u" and "me". I read before seeing that BII contains a lot of original images and played the actress Love. While watching "Boogeyman's Turn", I decided to stay around the original movie to see the notorious toothbrush scene. Before you know that, the movie is over. Peel off. I think I thought this was BII because it has a title similar to one of BII's alternative titles. Well, at least that was just an extra feature, was not it? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the mistakes of the movie. Many, many mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli What does he think? He really thinks the same film will sell in different forms. There is nothing original to hold the third part. It is, in essence, a retrospective of the original through the eyes of a psychic who gives us a boring boring game while everything is happening. This is the movie. Oh, and a stereo scene of death, but you can read this from someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final Note: There is not a series of movies to be viewed backwards.
