The fact that none of these women have any names almost makes you suspect that the actress was talking about her own real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I must admit that I want to see once again more romantic views about the first sexual encounters, as in Strike (1998), when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances began to wonder about her supposed first, and Tweety asked: Was it nice? "Some might think that re-enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think it would do even worse. You do not have to be serious porn to attract my attention, but somehow I waited longer.
