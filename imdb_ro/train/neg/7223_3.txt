My first attempt to track this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the TV script I could not handle. It went about like this: Reporter 1: Hmm, there is a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. * Inconvenient silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... A few days later I looked up to the end and it was not as horrible as I imagined, but there are serious issues with that. Almost half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be extended to explain the background story or something. What do the detective, the eugenics and the monsters that are being eliminated by Horus right now? More fun was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gods "who have lived for eons, and from all the games in multivers we happen to play the monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken seems coherent, compared to this. The other half is terrible. What did our protagonist do to freeze? Why was there not a big event when he was released at the end? Those boring followers, remember? What happened to ordinary people? What's the deal with the guy? How did a blue girl appear? What's her eyes? Still, and so on. From a visual point of view, it is good, more or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods, looking like rotweiller heads.
