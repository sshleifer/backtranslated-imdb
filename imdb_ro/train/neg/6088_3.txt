Why do I watch movies like this? - Besides the fact that I have a wrong, strange masochistic belief that one day I will find a real jewel among all these dross, I can not think of one good reason. This movie was slag from start to finish - but semi-hilly slag. Where else, but in an evil Italian film called, you may find incorrect exchanges of overwhelming English like this between an honest military guy and the sinister head of a secret X file as an organization dedicated to concealing the "Truth": <br /> The man in Black: Silence is the best for us until we are able to prove that UFOs have no serious reasons. <br /> <br /> The military type: In any case, it seems to me abusive interference. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Black people: <br /> <br /> I resume the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half a dozen times and still can not make those lines mean something sensible. "We could be quite difficult for those who are contracting our interests." It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlight of this boring plunger of a movie for me was the total distance of the photographer's character at first. Saddled with the worst EVER haircuts in the history of everything, the man just wandering around looks like a stunned fish in a wicked wound up kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglass by some strangers. Aliens are the most effective unseen as a shot POV camera - with a fish eye lens - somewhat scary for the first time, but always used and quickly, lost its power (incidentally, if it is a viewpoint, it means that aliens always leave the rooms back for some reason). The film was established in "England". This meant Spanish designers of Italian sets put some British pads on some English cars and put a Jack Union on our hero's press book ... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like the UK at all. <br /> <br /> The favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not notice that the characters they were fooling (there is such a word?) They did not walk on the gravel, but they were now on the lawn, so that their feet continued to make a strong crisis! noise. Besides, another total loss of 90 minutes of my life. I hope to prove that those UFOs have no serious reasons soon ...
