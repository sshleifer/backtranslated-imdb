I based this on my remarks about an episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll look again. The act was completely wooden, the plot was completely predictable, the ending being totally unrealistic - I mean who would believe a $ 30 million trial for the death of a drug-addicted cancer patient? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad the writing was! I realize that the drama offered this season is quite poor, but it certainly can find better writers. Perhaps it outsources writing in India or China! I bet we will not see this next season again!
