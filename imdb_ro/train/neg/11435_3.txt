I'd like to know more about this movie when I rent it. I would put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong belief as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the film was invented, undeveloped, or otherwise simply boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people who thought they were a couple ... I do not care how big a part of the story line, which still felt a little, thick. And Charlie, for a zoologist, certainly does not seem very endowed with the signals of the other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (apart from her determination and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been much more interesting, with a lesser depth. Highlights - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who found them sometimes annoying), the deck cab and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such big dancers, I would have liked to see more about that, like bits that we were shown that they were really better than most of the rest of the film). It could have been better.
