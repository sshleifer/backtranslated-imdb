It starts very well, intro and build for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. The character is in the same matrix as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without claiming the shooting or innovation story that made Pie more a commercial success. Let's be honest - Heder's act was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did everything they could, but they did not have any plot or substantial scene to get their teeth into the movie. The film unfolds with no rhythm or a clear logical story that justifies its length. The end is about as predictable as to come - so predictable, I checked the spoiler box for this line. My advice: avoid at all costs if you really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch and even then you will feel that the producers have just deceived you for one and a half hours of your life.
