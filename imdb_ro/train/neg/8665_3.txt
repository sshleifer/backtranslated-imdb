This is a horror film created by Roger Corman. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. A first-time engineer crook kills one of his own, then becomes the taste of man and becomes a rapidly growing terror after escape. None of the characters have any depth, but they are not the focal point. I just get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best scenes "kill" in a small budget movie. My favorite scene is a moronic character trying to use three dog tied for bait and gets croc food himself. Nothing left on the dig, but on the feet of the upper ankle. With no real roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and a professional crooning stray Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed by Joanna Pacula, attractive, being respected by Dr. P. DINOCROC who redeems as a piece of pickle.
