I came to look at the tenants with my close friends who rented the film based on the look of Snoop Dogg (their passionate fetish) on the cover. Obviously, I did not expect too much. I thought the movie would include a typical range of imagery and imagery related to Snoop Dogg, often seen in rap cliche clips. However, my generalization was largely wrong. Unfortunately, this did not make the movie better. Most would describe the film as a dark, dramatic drama, while describing it as a dark, serious shot. The film tells the story of two fighter writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own masterpieces. Their opposite opposing life styles form an unexpected but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the film as a wild rollercoaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - which reminds of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder. And although the movie is a drama, the act - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and the company was more comic than anything else. I would not recommend this movie to those who are carefully affected because it has much dialogue and much more dialogue afterwards. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are largely blocked with more dialogue. The end, however, jumped with a sudden surprise. It was a little twisted, somewhat unexpected, and a perfect way to conclude a movie that was about to end. As I watched the ending credits, I could not imagine the director thinking, "God, how dare I finish this snoozer." By the way, the director carefully set the plants and subtleties that led to the climax-all of which were more visible than Waldo in a crowded stony street that wore nothing but black sweaters.
