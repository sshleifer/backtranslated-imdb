I would love to record this movie, but Van Damme does exactly the same old old garbage in time. Poo knickers fight scenes as usual. The only thing that the loser left behind was that the Russians normally end up being killed in the end. This film is a complete puppy make it of the highest nature, please, please, please Van Damme get some lesson lessons, you need them. Anyone who likes Van Damme has trouble, It seems that is the only way Van Damme ever has an acting, when he collaborates with the movie that produces the film and makes the screen for the film. AVOID VAM DAMME AND ULTIMATE NASTY WIG BACK. I give this film two out of ten, because the sandman was better. To add an insult to the injury, we lost a sum on this manure
