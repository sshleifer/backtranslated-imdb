Who wrote this? A guy named John Cohen. I think it was the first scenario he ever worked on. Someone should have told him that you have to write a dialogue that would seem something someone could say. And who directed this? Scott Maresal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell away from the tree. Someone would have wanted to say that you can actually shoot a scene in a New York taxi, and that will look real and you will not have to fake a blue screen for no reason. She would have wanted to tell her she should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully she learned this lesson now. And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can not act. Hell, it makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn and yet she has the role of playing in this movie. Wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why he took his share. That's why I can think. So, should I be surprised that it's bad? Not. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think it would be a lot of people if they'd seen so much like me. I mean, you're expecting a movie where you play Jessica Simpson to be bad, but that ... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this movie is just as bad as the movie is good. It's Anti-Annie Hall. I'm so glad I did not pay to see it, I stopped for ten minutes while I could not go on. No doubt I would have left the theater earlier. Actually I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw the theater actually stood and looked at everything. The film starts from bad laughter, and then gets to the point of being so bad that it becomes some kind of Chinese torture of water. And then, around when the first act ends, you realize that it will get worse and then you have to go or kill yourself. In conclusion, this movie falls into the category of being so bad, it should be used instead of the embarkation of the Guant√°namo Bay. Although some prefer watering.
