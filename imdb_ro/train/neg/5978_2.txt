This third Pok√©mon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repeated to entertain older children. The film's message - to deal with the loss - is subjugated by the return of the young man's father during filming. The Rocket team offers some fun, but they are not part of the little plot, so they do not appear too often.
