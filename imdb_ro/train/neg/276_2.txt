Characters are clickable and predictable, with everyone being either snow-bearing or pure. The actress is too busy for it to be bad in a fun, up-and-coming fashion. It's twice disappointing if you're a fan of Bette Davis, because her character is not a typical Bette-Davis character; she just becomes frighteningly frowned. Overall, neither did my wife find the movie interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
