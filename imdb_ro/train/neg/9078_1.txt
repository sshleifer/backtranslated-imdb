Would not it be great if another teenager's film does not end all these nonsense, I have no more sex than you are teenage movies? In a perfect world, yes. However, this is even worse. It is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating to the distributor. All jokes are, in principle, students that expose things people are probably not interested in seeing, yet it's "funny." Devon Sawa, who was actually good at the Final Destination, is simply boring in this movie. It makes you wonder if it's bad. Grade: F
