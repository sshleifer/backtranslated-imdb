How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not understand. Trick or Treat managed to do it. This sucks and likes it. Trick or Treat is one of the movies I have to warn about people. It is an enmity that causes shedding, just begging to be seen, so you can feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redemption factors. For a film about heavy metals, it certainly does not seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it is. This film manages to make metal hard to show blades and this was in 1986, probably one of the most powerful heavy metal classes. This is quite a feat, however negative. Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry with yourself because you have followed him. This simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this movie without a brain or bullets.
