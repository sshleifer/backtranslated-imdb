The only reason I saw Shakedown was that he had Erika Eleniak in it. She is sexy as always, but she plays second life at the man Wolf Larson. It is a shame because it has more action capabilities than it allows to show here. The film consists largely of endless shooting that quickly becomes monotonous - especially when you see the bad guys who were gunned with machine guns who constantly lost Larson and armed him only with a revolver (which NEVER it's draining from bullets) quite easy. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there is also an unclear motion and a poor CGI explosion. As a psychotic "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo punch he has to do is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman, or Larson (supposed to have any) completers might want to give a look, for others they just deserve a rental. (* 1/2)
