Even for a tired movie model, such as the "nature vs. man" cycle, which predominated so much in the 1970s, ants are far from being effective (though fun for unintentional reasons). It's so absurd. It seems that these ants who are cursed near an inn have consumed for decades toxic waste and have now adapted themselves by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of such bites are fatal. Watching the actors of a certain notoriety falling amazingly in the middle of a small black feather is painfully funny in a way not so good but very bad. So many scenes seem ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a garbage dump while attacking, Suzanne Sommers shouting in horror while lying in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper , Bernie Casey falsifying a leg of the game continues and continues. The danger presented ranges from ants that crawl from a drainage channel to black ant lines all over the walls. The film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair with this horror. I hope he found good use for money, because it is obvious that it was the only reason a woman with a pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although it is a bad film, it can be tracked - once for me, and it has many of those seventy negative qualities of the film - terrible novice actors who feel comfortable for television and fearful creatures of nature who take revenge on humans. This time man has to push his hand into a bunch of ants to be affected. Very terrible.
