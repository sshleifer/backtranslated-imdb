Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a tiny part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community who realizes that his town is a criminal bite. It's not just some mushrooms, it's a carnivorous killer, bigger than normal, moved by toxic waste (but it's just as fast as a normal slug, which is not so frightening but I'm moving) . No one will believe it at first, but they will. Oh yes, they want. Okay, the killer bullets are just above psychotic laziness and even under Johnathon Winters, like Mork's baby in the humiliating factor. So the absurdity of everything is quite obvious from going go. The movement is fun to some extent and is of the "so bad that it is good". I appreciate that they said they were Slugs: the film unlike Slugs: Children's Games or Slugs: Another White Meat. You probably do not deserve to follow it more than once and forget it for a moment, except that you played a rather trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is best known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K deserved) and "Peices" (which is probably the most funny bad movie ever made) Candy Eye: Kari Rose presents T & A <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extract: Just a Draw Trailer for This Movie
