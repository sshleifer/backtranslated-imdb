First, if you are a fan of the comic, well, you will be very disappointed I'm sure! Low-budget movie! Largo should be Serbian in comic, now suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! the chicken producers gave a smell and courage to the comic (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The building of the New York building becomes a common small-yacht in H.K. Largo, who looks good, becomes a guy who has not been polished by Tzigan / Turc. Freddy's "scarface" chiller pilot becomes a fat type, form, sad, medium. Simon, Largo's friend, does not exist at all! He gave a little pepper! Largo does not throw the knives at all, but just snake ... The whole story is confusing and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the ability or the technology to adapt the comic, please respect a Romanian story drawn in Paris. Very bad movie, good thing I leased, I did not rely on me to follow the sequel (If there is!).
