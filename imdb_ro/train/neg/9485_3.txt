Because others have gone to the difficulty of summarizing the plot, I would like to mention some points about this film. There can be spoilers; I'm not interested enough to remove them. - Considering the low budget of the film, the design of the creature was pretty good. It's actually nice to see a video-directed horror film that does not match horrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of the digital film is quite granular in places and is most visible in the well-lit white rooms of the asylum. - The lively lighting design makes the parts of this film do not say anything about variations in time. I understand that the director would have tried to simulate dementia, but in order for this time stream to be effective, it must be established. As it is, it is simply amateur. <br /> <br /> - Overturning has been numerous, but consistently predictable. I had no doubt in my mind about the identity of the crooked worshipers, nor the fact that a kind of lame-evil-trumps-a good development will come to an end. strange, but the characters in this movie do not manage to use any common sense. First of all, the regulatory committees would be entirely a mental health center that unilaterally declared that all patient and employee deaths are induced by cardiac arrest. Why would a psychiatrist head be able to perform autopsies? Why was it not a plotting point made out of these impressive qualifications or its introduction to strange choice of religion? What is the background? What should make us care about someone in this? And equally important, who should go through the introduction to that place, see everything that was so scary wrong with him, and then conclude that it was still a great place to follow your residence ? This film did not really respect the characters to give the intelligence the advantage of doubt. Bottom Line: See The Wicker Man instead.
