Some humorous fun, some that collapse, decent action, some pretty atrocious. This movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteed to amuse boys 12 years more than any other niche. The child's actors in the film are just unhappy. When you make a family comedy, that's not a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a funny and dare to say it, a human performance amid this mediocrity.
