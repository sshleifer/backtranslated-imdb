While "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" is usually quoted as one of the worst films ever made, this 1959 Mexican film is so bad that SCCM makes "It's a wonderful life." You have to ask what the people who made the film think; they probably meant it as an allegory of the third world about capitalist greed and visible consumption. Not. . . They were just not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of Little Red Riding Hood, in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has the indisputable clues of pedophilia. (Maybe this was the inspiration for "Freeway.") Back to Santa Claus: Instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas is in a satellite in geosynchronous orbit of the earth (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves, his toys are produced by children chosen from all over the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to just check which babies are naughty and beautiful. The result is like a sweat shop in Orwellian cosmic space. It's enough to get back from Christmas forever. This film and other films of discarded Mexican children were named in English and widely distributed in the US in the early 1960s; no wonder the sixties have become such a turbulent period in American history. Children who were forced to bear these "family" movies as children would be too eager to turn into revolutionaries.
