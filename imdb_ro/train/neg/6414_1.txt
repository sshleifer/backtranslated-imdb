This is the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It just made sense. It was not at all scary (unless you're scary as loud noises and screaming), Sarah-Michelle Gellar has to stop with these terrible movies. I think all the others in the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits were over. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, so it happens: <br /> <br /> 1. The return 2. The cab fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason for which we did Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. Just like cabin fever, it made no sense, but the return was on that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever
