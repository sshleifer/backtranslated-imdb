I wanted to put the fist on the TV. Seeing it was torture. I hated him. Never look at this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. Normally, I like it, but not in this. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating film in the world. The comedian he envies is unpleasant. The only fun part is the black teeth rocker who got all the girls. It was so irritating I wanted to put the fist on the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE THAN YOU DO NOT WANT NECESSARY. If you really like Adam Sandler a little, do not buy it. It will make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of the danger of buying. It's a waste of $ 1.99 I paid for him.
