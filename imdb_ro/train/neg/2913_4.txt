it is, of course, very nice to see improvements in the Turkish cinema industry, however, I would have expected something more creative than Togan Gokbakar. starting from the script, which I think was not a written book, as some can think. especially the issue of dialogues that put the audience in a position that would not have been smart enough to understand the situations that most often make the film unbearable. also has an obvious ending; you can easily guess the killer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously ill patients to behave like ordinary people, such as professionals right away! have ever looked for the possibility that patients on heavy medications behave as professionals and use all the medical terms that even ordinary people can not use also on the stage where staff seek the most dangerous patient without had no weapon to protect himself, was another strange point in the movie. and that the scene was so suitable for "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" title! these are not the only weak parts of the film. there have also been a lot of preciousness in the film. the image of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal, too, Togan's appearance is, of course, the most serious mistake he could have made in his first film! the excitement about the greatness of the film and about the interviews the actor gave only to people to be curious and to force them to see it. Gender is a total disappointment. I would be surprised if Sahan would not have been so famous, Togan would be able to film this movie with this big budget amount? I hope Togan realizes he is not in fashion to play as a director, as he said in an interview. Hitchcock did it wisely and the night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware that he is not yet Hitchcock and Shyamalan !!!! hoping to be more attentive and creative next time in this great industry!
