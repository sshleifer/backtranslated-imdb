Three stories are narrated in this film, which seemed to have been shot without knowing it was a combined film. Manufacturers refer to the three veneers by connecting them all to shrink Martin Kove, although you never see part of Kove's leadership. The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of all the sun (she makes Adrian Monk look courageous) having an evening of sweet paranoia at home alone. You will literally shout at Vivian because you did some ridiculous things. She spends most of her time in the night showing her stunning features. But her movie is the worst, if not the weirdest. <br /> <br /> The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton while portraying his roommate in Hell. His college colleague allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it whenever he can. The last vignette was funny because a man is afraid that death will take him at any moment, just like his boyfriend who suffocates to death on an olive tree. Not very interesting, because the movie as a whole seems to be cut together with very little thought involved. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
