Action in the movie is very well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it becomes interesting it slows down to a major stop. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, did a great job, so did the other actors, as I mentioned, but the man ... this is one of the most serious movies ever seen. Now, perhaps in a short film, this movie would be good but not that one, avoid it. This film has so much stuff that it makes a Twinkie Cake Jealous. <br /> <br /> I never went to the movies, but I was watching home with my family, I left. Yeah, it was boring. It looks like my comment does not have enough lines for posting, so here's more stuffing. I think I was inspired by the movie that I just watched.
