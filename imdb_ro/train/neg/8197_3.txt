I just saw this movie and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he is even more annoying, and this movie is more than a remake of the classic "Santa Claus of the Movie," but with the exception of the camp or bad play Sheena Easton at the end. . The story is your run of the black sheep in the family, who returns to meet his family for holidays, but with the North Pole as a setting. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family who returns home after a series of backs that includes his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo role), taking him to him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Claus Claus (Paul Giamatti) and the high jinks accompany a bit of brotherly rivalry and a bit of anarchy that threatens Christmas all the time. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think you'll be right because it's predictable for the hill. As for acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same losing love he always plays, but this time he becomes more annoying than sympathetic, Miranda Richardson plays Ms. Claus, but the role is more than a note, Elizabeth Banks playing Santa's assistant, but she's not much of a character other than a neurotic joke, and Kevin Spacey basically ends up with the same person she's starring in "Glengarry Glen Ross," but less anal. The only two actors who came out of this film with their intact dignity are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and heats up to his role as Santa Claus, but looks somewhat embarrassed to be in the movie, and you can not blame him or her Rachel Weisz, who manages to do much more with a very small role than most of the main actors with them, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserve much better than what he has given this scenario. <br /> To put it briefly, a major disappointment.
