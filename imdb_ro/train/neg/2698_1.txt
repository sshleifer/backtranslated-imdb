This film shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays white and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same educational system that has made him what he is and has not succeeded. The character of Ice Cube is the symbol of a black instigator who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely reached the relationship between white and black characters trying to get to each other. When Omar Epps says, "I have to be with my people," that racist remark spoke. And John, you do not even think for a moment that Thomas Jefferson's picture on the tower ladder has not caught my attention. Good touch!
