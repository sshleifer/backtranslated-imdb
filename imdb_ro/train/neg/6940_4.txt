When you have two arrays of artists who oppose each other, you can least expect the wonderful camaraderie, and so it happens in this movie where we have a 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan story, a 34-year-old taboo. Wait! In fact, that's all in the name of the plot, so instead of "cheeky," the content that is "Kum" in this Adman was the first effort of R. Balki of Writer R. <br /> <br /> Trust two top actors to bring the house down with their wise cracks and bitter moments sweet when love happened in this unconventional pair and that's all you find in the first slow but refreshing half. London, captured in the rainy season, are captivating. By the end of the first half, romance ended and the mission was accomplished. There is not much to say. Therefore, in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of the father of the girl as far as he goes for a Satyagrah is indeed a patience test. There is a climax as strange as to how he demonstrates. The result, the second half is dry, flat, without energy. There is a subplot with a baby girl who died of cancer without having a big impact. However, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and performance.
