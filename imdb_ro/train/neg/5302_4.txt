Dewaana, as a movie, goes through the usual cliches. The man and the woman fall in love and marry, the husband is supposed to be killed by a family friend who wants his family's fortune, women and surprising remembrance, husband no. 1 reappears. The film reminds Chandni of Yash Chopra and countless other people. Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan offer good performances. Amrish Puri, like a bastard, goes through movements and is nothing more than a standard character of bollywood. Nadeem Shravan's music is superb, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary movie that moves through.
