I stayed on almost one episode of this series and I could not take longer. It felt like I had seen dozens of episodes and then hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I heard that joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone falling like a friend, a Happy Days episode had almost the same story, ect. None of the actors is interesting here! Some were good on other performances (not here) and others are new to a profession that they should never have introduced. Avoid this stinker!
