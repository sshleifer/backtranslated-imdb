SWING! is an important film because it is one of the other films produced and made by black in the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unsecure, but it is in a pretty good shape. It's also a great chance to see many of the most talented black performers of the period just after the glory of the old cotton club - a moment forgotten today. Unfortunately, while the movie is historically important and has some wonderful shows, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicians of the time - including a first donna that will destroy the spectacle and the unknown surprise that does not appear from where to save the day. However, writing is just terrible of God and a bit tired sometimes - and it projects images of Black America that some might find a bit of dement. This is because before you really start the plot, you are treated to a crazy person who lives because of his heavy wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (which, by the way, totally overlaps this role) have a fight that looks like a WWE Smackdown scene! And, the lady wants to cut the other ladies with a straight lawn car - really a nasty scene! Later in the movie, when the first woman behaves abominably, her husband strikes her in front and everyone cheers him! It seems that the movie sometimes wants to appeal to the smallest common denominator in the PLUS audience that I can not do even well - with some of the worst actions I have seen in a very long time. > <br /> However, if you can look at bad production in almost any way (with traced characters, bad action and poor direction and writing), it might be worth a look so you can see the excellent song and dance - and to capture a miracle of forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's really bad!
