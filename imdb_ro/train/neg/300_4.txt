Robert Taylor has definitely proved to be a remarkable actor in his role as a buffalo hunter in this Western West. It was one of the few moments when Taylor would play a hard movie. However, this image was far from great, shortly thereafter, Taylor ran on television with the successful series The Detectives. Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned into a formidable performance as a partner of Taylor. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a bigot here and his hat for the Indians really looks. Another very good performance here was veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an old man who drank old, who also joined the buffalo hunters. In his early scenes, Nolan really made an excellent take off of Walter Huston in his role as Oscar winner in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan would join Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> Writing in the film is at best rigid. By the end of the movie, the elements of nature have made Taylor. How about the elements of writing here?
