While Leon is cute on the SNL, it's just one minute. Like most SNLs in movies, it can not fill up for 90 minutes. It has some nice moments (the ones you saw in the trailer), but the actors are mostly wasted. Tim Meadows does all the best, but the plot does not have many high points. Will Farrell has a bit of a hand. Farrell may be the funniest man in life ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
