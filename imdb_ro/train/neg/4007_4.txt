I hope that who trained these losers on their accents was fired. The only high points are some of the side characters, 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed outside of the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put this in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay sex with vampires gay, gay sex with vampires straight, sex to score vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire sex, non-vampire sex, sex because we fear of vampires, sex because we are upset by vampires, sex because I just became a vampire, etc. Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it were a bit subtle, being padded in the story. Maybe a story AVEA and then a shooter some sex in it. But they do not even bother to do that ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy toothbrush bitch. Whether it sucks or her character sucks, I can not figure out what. Another part of the story I find extremely unlikely is the reason for Bill, the 150-year-old vampire who seems to have things together, would be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly flies from the handle to him for things she can not control. He leaves for two days and she already decides that he "does not return" and suddenly has feelings for the dog-man? Save me. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People close to her are dying everywhere and have the smoothest smile on her face because she just gave her a book to a guy because she can not read her mind? As the main character of the story, I would have hoped the show would do more to make her understand and someone to invest your interest, not someone you secretly hope to be killed or put in a coma. I can not find anything about the character I like, and even the fact that she can read her mind is impressively uninspired and not interesting. I will not miss the time to watch Season 2 come in June.
