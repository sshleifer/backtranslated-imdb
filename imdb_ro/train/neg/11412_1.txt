This movie is so bad, you can not imagine. The act is terrible, even worse than in third grade soaps. It is a shame that this film has been the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. Interactions between soldiers made no sense. The story could have been taken out of a bravado story, the dialogues were as woody as the Treebeard, and the plot holes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it does not need much to satisfy the public. The actors were beautiful, for example, the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung up (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. He's a real bad man! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13 years. But the media created an atmosphere where you were not allowed to reject the movie because they manipulated the dynamics of the group of friends, saying implicitly that you are a nerd if you do not go along with the other 'sheep' and say. just as it was when I was in the army / that's what I'm gonna do when I'm going to the army ... every crude action that's about drugs and cool. And you do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I offended a lieutenant). It is not necessary for each movie to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget about the problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But this type of movie influences adolescents a lot, showing them a cold lifestyle that is, in fact, just bad and turns them into ignorant and egocentric idiots. But since now that my opinion is not very popular, I will be quiet now and I recommend you avoid this terrible blow at any cost and to save your wits! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
