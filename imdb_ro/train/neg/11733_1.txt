I'm shocked that there were some people who liked this movie ... I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it in scenes that were not supposed to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in public but honestly, the plot to this movie required a MAJOR REVIEW .. it did not even make sense, a second character questions that is exactly that I'm snorting .. next scene are hopeless addicts and realize how to do it? The end also took only the cake ... I will not spoil the magnificent conclusion ... but quite mixed even with the rest of the horrible plot / scenario ... see this movie for comedy if you have to ..
