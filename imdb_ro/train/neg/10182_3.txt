All right, just by reading the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least we did. It started well but became so boring after the first half hour. Spoiler Tells a story about a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any length to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's boyfriend is on the way. She always wins the contests, pushing her mother further to "eliminate" her. After talking to a "hitman," Mother decides that the little girl has to be a little lost. So the actions are taken, but it is finally caught. The cast is horrible and the movie takes too long without anything happening. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
