I have to be a guy in America who did not like this movie. I think this was not my style or something, I do not see what is so fascinating about it, that was just fun, not to mention one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> It's a guy who has not come from anything, and he's becoming a drug dealer. Pretty simple to describe a whole movie and that's exactly my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafia / drug trade / criminal groups does not automatically make a great movie, do not forget the good story.
