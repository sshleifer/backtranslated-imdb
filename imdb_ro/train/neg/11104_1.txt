I'm not one of those people who go online only after seeing a movie and I've decided to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. However, for the first time, I saw a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it just ended. I love bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most horrible horror films were good. However, there is no good thing about this movie. If someone reading my review loses their money to see it, they can figure out what the plot might be, but I advise that a nickel would deserve more than just watch this movie. I am bad. The actor is bad. The two causes are attractive, but that's all. I'm not the kind of ruining a movie for anyone, but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask my opinion on this movie before losing a penny on it. I will say anything. I like bad movies, I like horror and I like new inventive movies. I really love pornographic horror stories like the Hostel (which some reviewers claimed to have been so, but obviously thought this was caused by Roger Bart and Hostel 2). But this may be the Fifth, the worst and the worst EVER movie. And before ignoring this review, it comes from someone who not only stood in the entire premiere of the House of the Dead, but actually bought a copy of it.
