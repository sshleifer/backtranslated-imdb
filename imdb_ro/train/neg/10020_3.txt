Vijay Krishna "Tashan" of Acharya is an oversized, stylized product. Of course it's one of the most elegant movies, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject that. Why? The film's script is as amateur as a 2-year-old. Script is king, without a good script, not even the greatest director of time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars that appear in it. But nothing on earth can save you if the scriptures are gentle. Your thumb down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could it have such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving sage. Kareena Kapoor has never been so hot. Looks stunning and lets you get up. Saif Ali Khan does not get his debt here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. "Tashan" is a boring movie. The failure of box-office movies should keep you away.
