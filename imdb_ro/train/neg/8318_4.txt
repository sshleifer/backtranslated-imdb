I have already seen fantastic stories, but the premise of this is so incredible that it comes very close to being ridiculous. A rich and young guy suffers a heart transplant one day after marriage, and he is somewhat witnessing to his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens in the future is a mixture of dialogue between ... say ... souls? ... maybe the real life in which the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. There is no shadow of suspense or emotion, but only a combination of an evil and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. It does not mean that the film is totally lacking in quality - in fact, director Joby Harold has for the first time done a decent job directed by a good team of actors, including Hayden Christensen in his first major role after taking out Anakin Skywalker, the fabulous Jessica Alba and super-talented Lena Olin. Everyone would have deserved a better story.
