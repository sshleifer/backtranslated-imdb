This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful, but it ends here. It seemed that an unimportant Set It Off met the West. The plot had no meaning. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop their personalities. There have been unnecessary things that happened and they did not refer to the plot or helped the story. There were also empty moments where the plot could have been explored, but it was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense, as well as the direction. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just watching for candy, then this is the movie for you.
