A pretty madman, who has a total black cast, who tries to figure out who killed the philanthropist trumpet who was about to go to Hollywood to make Big. Was that his wife? His girlfriend? His girlfriend? Her father? His butler? The newspaper type? Who knows? And who cares? The result is just a little overwhelming, and the actors here do not really bring me into a mood to take care of one way or the other. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is fine, but it's a bit of it, and most of it is pretty, "Let's get it done." He is not worthy of your time. There are better black and black movies there.
