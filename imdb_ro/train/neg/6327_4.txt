I thought this movie would be much better than it was. He seems to be a spy on the genre spy, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie got short. The land is just ridiculous. The KGB and Soviet Union in Russia have set up an espionage school to teach their spies how to behave like the Americans, but the city they organized for training is a little dated, so they take two Americans to refresh things up. I do not know, but it just seems there. It's really strange when, with nobody in this Russian city, they speak with Russian accent. Someone died in the casting service. Also, for a comedy, this is painfully dry. There are one, two funny top points and there is nothing to play and dance. The movie, eventually, will probably make you sleep. And, like a blunt blow in the face, this movie is so pro-American that it hurts me. The film continues to say again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is a kind of scandal campaign that was made against the Japanese in the Second World War. There are movies like this, which makes everyone believe the US is full of itself. It becomes a 4 out of 10, and I'm good. She should really have won one, but the dance script was funny but again it was dragged to long to be very funny.
