This movie must be the biggest stack of steam that I've ever seen. What can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is nothing to save this "movie" and I NEVER even say about making a sequel. If you are thinking about pursuing this, then you should know that the story is that two people are trashing to save the earth. Movies like "Black Men" were torn apart and resumed to make this "Comedy," but they all failed. Avoid this movie (save yourself).
