When it comes to horror films, I'm more than willing to suspend my unbelief, ignore the sub-par production values, and overlook the plot holes in the interests of good hope. This movie simply has no hope to offer. He can not even enjoy the camp. The bad dialogue, the bad action, the bad direction, the killings were predictable and insufficient, the music was annoying, the work in the room was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt very bad for the actors who obviously tried, but who had to deal with a terrible and controversial dialogue and a clear lack of direction. I doubt they have rehearsals. It's embarrassing to look, and it's so boring than to do the end of the "surprise" with the extraordinary resistance. It's quite easy one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Normally I do not write reviews, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss "Doing" -features. The writer / director seems to have the impression that making a murderer a woman was a bold, bold move. (He saw it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it were a "Citizen Kane". It's like listening to a group of third grade students to take you behind the scenes from their Christmas contest. They think they created something of substance. Is it sad indeed? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for true atrocities such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So, "American Nightmare" is not the biggest movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the fifties below.
