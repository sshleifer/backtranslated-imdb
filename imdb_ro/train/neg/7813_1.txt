In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of the Hollywood ego, beaten only by the new kong movie. Superman is the super hero of the original and deserves to be treated with respect even if he wears cards. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen since the beginning of the movie. I just want to put a piece of kryptonite on my neck. She simply looks wearing the costume. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she should be a strong reporter, but in this film she looks more like a school. The plan was poor and predictable (WOW, he is actually the supermans son, who would have ever believed ....) and the action was horrible. This movie has a good thing for him, and he's called Kevin Spacey. Lex Luthor's image was brilliant, but he even failed to save this film. What required this movie was "Lois and Clark" (with the exception of Kevin Spacey, of course) and a different story. I looked at this movie after I saw the "hills have eyes" and I was pushed to find out that there are worse movies then.
