When I watch a movie, I'm aware that it's just a "movie," but still I like to allow myself as much as possible under these circumstances. I think that makes us cry, scream, laugh, or react emotionally as members of the audience, though, deep down, we know it's just a movie. What I do not want is the movie to remind me that it's just a movie, so I can not get into the aforementioned involvement regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this film chose to frequently use multiple camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I think this is terribly fun and even irritating. It might run a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen reading "Warning: This is just a movie. Do not let yourself become too interested or cared for." If I want "image in the picture", I will activate it from my remote, but never during a movie I want to enjoy.
