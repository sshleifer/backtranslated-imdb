This is a pretty dirty piece of stuff on WW II codes that are broken, stolen, etc. The actor is about what I expected from this cast of MGM actors "B." A great deal of attention. Jean Rogers, who did such a wonderful job playing the cute Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon series, is just terrible in this film. Her character is extremely annoying. Not absolutely never leave with her. We must believe that during a world war, what would obviously be a secret secret secret unit, would allow her to come in and out of any office she chose, though she does not have an official post. From this point of view, I'm sorry I've ever watched this movie. It has forever changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers. Talent, she is extremely light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is the regular self, which means he is just right. <br /> <br />
