I would have liked this movie a little more would not have been for Jason (Herb) Evers constantly harping on the experiment. Many early commentators of the Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overloading. However, as more and more critics have watched the movie, they have seen that they were intended. Obviously, Jason Evers is not Toshiro Mifune, and his story is exactly that. Most actors of this classic B were pretty good actors, minus Evers and showgirls. If you were watching this movie, you would have noticed that Evers cried almost every line, that is, until he smokes and blows the smoke with ice from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were for the course of a B movie, like that. In retrospect, there is not much to emphasize in my mind as fantastic good or bad for this film.
