Writers and producers of this little trip have dropped depths of depravity. The writer's block was so bad either that they suffocated so many ideas that they were forced to include a disgusting scene in which a young woman is unleashed on the back of a van and then throws the excrements to the car behind this sums up what this film deserves). They were already treated with one of the other women who urinated over one of her friends on the gun, as well as numerous graphic shedding episodes; once it would have been enough ... I got the message! This really takes the toilet's humor to another level! If the script and the acting were better, I would have forgotten that I was looking at a movie shot entirely on a low-budget video. This was a fairly original story, with an intelligent direction (the only one) in the sense that we only managed to take the view from within the wagon; making her feel more real. I've never seen it in other locations, like the store or the field where more women have disappeared, and this could have added a lot of tension. The script was terrible. Lines such as "I do not feel too good ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was followed by a psychopath; subjected to rape through a screwdriver and shot at, seems to be a little thin. The act was diabolical (apart from the maniac). All the top 5 actresses in this field have learned to act by taking a mailing course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad I had to watch the entire movie with the subtitles. The Director seemed to have a mild job in it. It seems that the only direction she should have been: "Scream girls". And how about screaming ...... If you are following this please be sure you have some paracetamol ready!
