It is not mentioned whether Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for the "House by the Door" in her 1970 novel with the same title, or someone else did. This Lifetime movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a shot when the film showed a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when critical moments precede commercials, which, of course, can not be found in this version, I've watched. The star of the movie is Lara Flynn Boyle, who has a new look that casts this viewer a curve due to the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Mrs. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character in the center of the mystery. This was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the room. This is also true of the rest of the Canadian actors who deserve better. The film has a feeling of cross between "Desperate Cabinets" and "Stepford Wives" and other more familiar features, combined with a low dose of fear. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as decoration.
