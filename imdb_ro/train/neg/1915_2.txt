It's a fairly good distribution, but the film is never near the original grace of the Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for a caper entertainment movie should visit the original. William Macy can be one of our greatest live actors, but he has nothing to use here. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm sorry for him trying to fill his shoes. He might try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured, but it does not bring anything into the story, the additional bits it adds to the story feel completely useless and the things they take are missed. Even starting the way they do seem strangely free and take away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and brilliant charm, and Luis Guzman has that strange feature, but the story of the love of the film seems strange and full. It's too bad that no one figured out how to make this movie as it was done for the first time, but again it's bad to live in a culture where we feel we have to remake stunning things instead of just learning to enjoy originals.
