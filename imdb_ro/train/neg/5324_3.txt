Vovochka is your daily film against hooligans. Vovochka, the main character, is marked early as a bad influence on neighboring children. With the words of the wisdom of two adults he encounters on the road, he finds the change of wrong ways, but worthy of doing. Personally, I found the actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however, changing the tone of the film would allow the most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good, but bad things happen further. This fight makes the film different from other films of the same genre, that is, the little flavor I wanted to say. Generally, I did not really care about this movie, though it was probably intended for a smaller audience.
