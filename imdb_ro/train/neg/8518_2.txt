I am amazed how many comments about this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is something, it's upside down in a great way. The actor calls the landscape enthusiastically and the plots have holes that you could drive a truck through. That's not what I call real. He is so serious about his desire to be "relevant" to show just how far away from reality is Rob Thomas and his staff. <br /> <br /> Overall, I realized that it is best a snooze-fest and, at worst, more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell shows she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the top style of the show.
