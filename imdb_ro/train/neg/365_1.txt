Wrong statue, bad dialogue, bad action, idiot targeting, annoying soundtrack that has run over the outdated scenario, and a bad copy of VHS can not be redeemed by drinking alcoholic beverages. Believe me, because we stuck this turkey to the end. It was so badly pathetic all over that I had to think it was a fourth spring spring paradise for Hitler. The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only spark of interest, and that was just because she could sing better than the original. If you want to look at something similar, but a thousand times better, then look over the Valley of the Dolls.
