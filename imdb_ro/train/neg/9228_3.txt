CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a David Mamet fan. The film follows a young director who makes a film inspired by Barbarella. After that, the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not realy. The Dragonfly movie, made in CQ, has the problem of not ending. This is very similar to CQ, which also does not end (in my opinion). I was lucky enough to capture this movie at the SxSW film festival. I have had quite big expectations, just watching Y You Mama Tambien and some other great movies. We also look forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not easy to get into the movie. If you're not in fifteen-year movies or in slow movies that do not go there, skip it. CQ feels like a student movie. If you want a recent Indie film Sci-fi chi Donnie Darko, it will not make you sleep.
