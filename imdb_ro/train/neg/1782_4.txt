A charming boy and his mother head in the middle of a city, cats and death are coming soon. That's the summary. I admit I'm a little scared of cats after seeing this movie. But with all the seriousness, despite the many things that are not right with this movie and believe me there is a lot to do, it's a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here, with only the basic instincts on which they are based. Fear, greed, pride of pride or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this apparent failure actually serves the story of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that Stephen King is a scenario (not that I have anything specific about Mr. King) are very well supported by some interesting things about FX, makeup and music quite right. The absolute stone of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, the mother of the other. The King manages to make a simple story about an outsider or people who are slightly different (well - in this case) trying to match and overthrow him in a field above the horror jewel collection that must be in the collection any horror fan.
