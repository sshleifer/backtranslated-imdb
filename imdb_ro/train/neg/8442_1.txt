Guernsey (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands, 2005). Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a thirty-year-old woman who finds her husband (Fedja van Huet) cheating, but you do not dare to confront him. It avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents, and her sister, so we have a leading character in a feature film that does not do much. We barely know anything about its background or motivation. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in public have to suffer as well? I almost gave up the cinema after seeing this miserable mess. These were very painful and painful for 90 minutes. Normally, I try to avoid energy consumption on the bad movie. I'll beat and throw with punches, but in this case it's a good warning. How did Nanouk Leopold on this land finance (mostly public funds) for this Turk? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It could be offset by an ingenious engineer with cinematic ideas or a distribution with just a little more attraction. No way, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from the point of view of the woman." The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a woman's perspective on life. In order to make things worse, there is no interesting photo to be found in the whole movie. I can not think of a cast that could have said that, but Johanna ter Steege is a small light in the dark, if possible, with this lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to lead Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll shoot you for three minutes, just express sadness." A perfect treatment for insomnia. Get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteeing too much sleep. Camera Obscura --- 1/10
