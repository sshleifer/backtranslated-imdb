"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related to the pre-sequel are on "Demons" and "Demons 2 are great hip classic hip 1980s." (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor and stupid writers who have bored William Shakespeare's ghost or demonic egg on the Spider Web site or what Huhuhuhuhu does the girl dream) I'm very sorry I bought the special box called "Demons" on the three different films called "The Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "The Dark Demons" did not shut off and the subtitles cost $ 14.99 from the store Best Buy in City of Downey Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are bad quality writers who make the bad movie "Halloween III" do not have the monster Michael Myer but the people were wearing Halloween I am very confused I really like "Demons" and " Demons 2 are better boring. "Dmuni III:" Ogre "is not part of" Demons "and" Demons 2 "are the same demons. Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
