Most students find themselves lost to bubbles by the academy, cut off from the communities they study and live in. Their conversations are with their colleagues and faculty. Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community on the basis of limited contact with a small number of members. The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed representing large groups of the population. As is usually the most screaming people get the most attention from the media. In addition to the misrepresentation of the community in which the film was established, the documentary was well done. My only argument is that the feelings and disorder described in the film have been attributed to the whole community, rather than the few people who have expressed them. It is, of course, important to examine a controversy like this and to make people aware of the differences that exist between the political points of view, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of several radicals.
