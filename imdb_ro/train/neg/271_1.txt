I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid science fiction fan. I've read countless sci-fi novels and I've had many SF movies and TV shows. I really would not even think of this real science fiction. Every episode I saw was like a lamehole, housed the version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that might be interesting or exciting. There is practically a bunch of people who are around ARMY fatigues, talking about something boring, which sometimes pass through the stargate and reach a planet that looks exactly like the Earth, with people that look and sound the same as humans! It seemed an extremely low budget. Characters are all forgotten dimensional cuts, and the many humorous attempts collapse. She reminded me when you saw an ad with a famous athlete in her, trying to be fun, but it is not. It's just sad. The movie was terrible. There are so many things you can do with a portal through space, yet every place that the army people do is HELP! This does not show imagination! In fact, I thought the TV series Alien Nation a few years ago (based on Alien Nation) was much better. This show actually had good story lines and decent characters. I was not crazy about the "Alien Nation," but compared to this overstated shit, it was great! Also, unlike the new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the blade movie too closely! They should have at least updated the special effect of "toilet flushing" every time someone goes through the Stargate.
