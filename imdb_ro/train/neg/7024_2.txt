I borrowed this movie because not only because the gay theme, but the thought of playing the role really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised to have been shot in San Francisco since I live near the SF. And, of course, it was nice to see pictures in the Castro neighborhood (although the castro for me is eating more homosexual men than women). But otherwise I can not recommend this movie. Characters are not really developed for me and when they started to get to "role play", I was already bored of my mind. And the role scenes I've seen were a little embarrassing to watch. The action leaves something to be desired. Needless to say I did not finish the movie. I'll jump on it.
