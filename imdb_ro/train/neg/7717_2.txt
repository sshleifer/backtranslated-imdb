When I heard the plot for this movie, I just had to see it, I mean whole cities that were wiped out by killer tombs! Unfortunately, the title is as fun as it happens. You lead Detective Dick Mason, a special team of soldiers and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never has the SCUBA and Lt. Finble that he never imagines without his parachute) Attack of The Killer Tomatoes is a parody of B films, especially Japanese horror in the 1950s. The film starts with a standard-size tomato discovered by a woman washing herself in the kitchen before finding us in the middle of a crime scene as the tomato assumed killed this lady, and let me tell you she has no saner as the movie progresses! To be fair, there are some funny moments, for example, whenever the Japanese researcher Dr Nokitofa talks that his voice is doubled in an American accent, or when the expert disguised Sam Smith infiltrates the hey of tomatoes, can somebody give him ketchup CPC? . Likewise, this movie was probably much more fun in 1978, so bad its good concept. Unfortunately, spoof movies such as the "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series have been launched and have made this comedy much better since then. The act is atrocious; there is zero editing continuity and it feels really slow and lacks energy. For a parody movie to work, you need a lot of things that happen at the same time, a gag after it's over. Song in the movie seems useless, and commercials for the furniture store that shone on the screen are even bizarre, even for this movie. In the end, however, you can see why this movie is a cult; I do not see many indifferent people. Unfortunately, it would be terrible how I would summarize this.
