Usually, I'm a bit of a fan of the fifteenth and early nineties movie featuring now beens ... but this movie is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to stay through. Boys dressed as girls were killed - but never so pathetic. Corey Haim's performance was as ugly as Nicole Eggert was not much better. This has no redemption qualities, even if you are a # 1 fan of an actor / actress in this piece of garbage - stay away!
