That's what I found myself saying from time to time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this apology for a movie. First of all, the effects of the computer are absolutely mind! These computer witches really deserve a bed on the back. The rest of the film, though ... None of the characters act in a realistic manner, especially in Act 3 of the third story (I promised not to give up this, but trust me, it is not worth keeping a secret!). A lot of laughs in the movie come unintentionally, as when trying to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please give your viewers more credit than that! Some sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? Nobody can catch you! These issues have been dealt with much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man of 1933. There is a scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and never mentioned later. If more attention had been paid, Kevin's crazy scientist might have felt less. <br /> <br /> The movie would actually be more successful than a porn, because the premise could actually be done in a unique and exciting way. But this piece of work ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! 3/10
