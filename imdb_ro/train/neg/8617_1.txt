After watching 10 minutes of this movie, I was amazed, after I saw 30 minutes, my toes twisted - I just could not believe it: The movie is really terrible. In fact, it's so terrible that I had to look at everything to be convincing (!). During this time, I came to realize that he reminded me of a lot of so-called Danish comedies of the 1960s and 1970s. The model is as follows: Take a very popular comedian, make a script that puts this comedian in as many grotesque situations, add a bunch of jokes (especially single) and spice him up with some beautiful girls - a movie that, and you have a success! I would not know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died in silence (with some great comedians), there seems to be a market for this type of film in the US.
