This is one of her films that has a wonderful video tape, but she has Camra cabra work and unknown actors talking with the bad dialogue. It's so dark when crimes happen it's hard to see, plus the movie is hard to understand. this is Vanessa Sanchez from WCW (Tygres in WCW before being folded) and she is a good actress. I like the movie with a special budget that has errors because it's fun to watch but Severed unfourtunatly is not one of them. This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and cut heads but this is not a blockbuster, but if you need something new to follow then closed the rent.
