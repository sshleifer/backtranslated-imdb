It's not the distribution. A better group of actors you have not found. It's not the place. The director is in love with New York City and by the end of the movie we are all! Woody Allen could not improve what Bogdonovici did here. If you want to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the right place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. Actors fall in love at first glance, words are useless. In the Hollywood director's actual experience, this happens when they go to work on stage. It's reality for him and his colleagues, but it's a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is empty and shallow and without messages.
