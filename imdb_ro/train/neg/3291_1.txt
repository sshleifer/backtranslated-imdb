First let me say that I'm not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looks like the Law and the Order. The worst thing was casting Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey like Roscoe, If they ever saw the show, Roscoe was not a strong cop. He was more of a Barney Fife than his role in this film. The movie is loaded with common errors, the machines are torn and continue as if nothing happened. The worst example is when the general gets together with Billy Prickett, and the general meets on a dirty hill, obviously slowing down to a close stop but continuing to win the race.
