Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after the Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "Jaws rip off", but it is obvious he tried to take advantage of Jaws' success. First of all, Orca, in my opinion, was a bad film, not terrible, but certainly not good, on average at best. The land is actually a male killer whale (orca) after seeing his partner and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I could not stand seeing this movie again. The direction of this film is weak and, compared to the jaws, it seems that the director, producers and writers have been almost without talent. Regarding acting, it was very average and credible, yet the real characters are not at least sympathetic. The effects turned out to be good for his time, and the recording of the killer whale looked pretty good. Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended to more sensitive people. Music is overstretched and very loud, drowning sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales do not mate with a single partner as described in Orca). In general, this movie was bad / poor in my opinion, for the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge among animals and humans, so I will not start this movie and understand why some might like it. / 10 (but for its concept, possibly, 5/10)
