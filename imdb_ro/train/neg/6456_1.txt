Well, what can we say about this disaster? I watched it because it was broadcast by cable. I'm sorry I lost my time, but I did not even waste money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the cheapest that you can get! Please, you have to be very generous not to get angry with the CHEAP Halloween costume. Well, there are also horrible action screens, f / x and dialogues. Confronting the creature is unbelievable, you can not get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from direct to filming. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON FICTURES movies look like "Halloween." <br /> <br /> Avoid this at any price, please. The only "positive" thing about this trash is sexy women.
