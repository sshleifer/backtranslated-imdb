The film launched in early 2000 with MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense The film seems to match the 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 Anyway, classic rocks in the film: Paresh Rawal I do not understand to laugh at his role of crying Reason: He goes looking for his mother in the village the worst is when he realizes Anil's secret that he keeps the secret in his stomach becoming great and makes me feel pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! like a kid I laughed at that moment but here? The whole movie is a joke can not explain We have Anil in a double role (an older and younger) and Rekha singing older wife and young Raveena I also rejected Harish while Shakti plays Aruna's son Iran, who also struggles with the weakest wig. The direction is outdated Music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil tries hard to look too old in the young and too young role in the higher role but still a good effort Rekha is right, Raveena too good Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant's okay in a cameo
