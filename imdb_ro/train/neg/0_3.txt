The story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. It starts with an opening scene that is a terrible example of absurd comedy. An official orchestra audience is transformed into a crazy crowd, violent by the crazy songs of her singers. Unfortunately, the time is absurd, without generalized narrative, which ultimately makes it too far. Even those of the time should be stopped. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third student. At a technical level, it is better than one could think of with a good cinema of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
