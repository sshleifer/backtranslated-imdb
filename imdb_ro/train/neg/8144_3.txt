I just saw this at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check this out. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. Besides being badly written, it was boring. I will not give up actors because there is not much to do with this bad scenario. The first bite was clich√©, without being ironic, over the top seriousness without being funny. The film would have been better if Hunt Hoe went horribly. Instead, he took it seriously and this resulted in a boring film. I can not recommend this movie. It was too long and yet very weak.
