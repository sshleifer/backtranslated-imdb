Obviously, a lot of talented crew members behind the scenes have worked on this film, so you do not even look at the credits at the end of the year, you'll just stick against them. No one seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two passed after 10 minutes and were lucky. "Monsters" were the unprepared worms in Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected the creatures of the Alien space creatures. The creators of the film obviously did not want to shadow fifteen cinemas, so they hired actors who failed to memorize their lines or, in some cases, learned to pronounce words before they started filming. Some scenes are incredibly inept to convey exactly what is supposed to happen, if anything. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this film is presented and you do not come out, you will laugh at the scary or suspense moments of the movie. The implausibility of several scenes will amaze you, and Stephen Dorff's regular scandal in "The Queen of the Words of Curse" conveys the feeling of the one who pays to see it. If you have to see this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it's in the shopping cart at the video store. If there is a justice in the cinema industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent you.
