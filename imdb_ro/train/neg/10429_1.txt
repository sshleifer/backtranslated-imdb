The first half was OK, but the last half was really disappointed. It's funny that the producers even admitted that they had no clue about the closure and even showed it. What is really sad is that I have to write ten minimal comment lines to post it. I really did not want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks because the show does not deserve this effort. When the galaxy Battlestar came out for the first time, I was very excited about the prospect of a better remake that it did not happen that the first limit of the season was space porn. Eventually they cleaned it a little and actually had a pretty fair drama, so I started looking again. But to end the kara series being an angel of the god cyclone, so did Baltar and six was bad enough.
