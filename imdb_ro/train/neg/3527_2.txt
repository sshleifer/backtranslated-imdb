it had to see this because it looked like a great scary premise - the prisoners found a magic book, a mistake! claustrophobic terrorism, etc., but it does not seem to be a story to go along with the great idea. rather than physical anxiety / horror, relies on the effects of open fire and body scares of the OTT - who are not scared at all if you are over 12 years old. The logic at the end of the year is ridiculous, the characters being killed for something other than the number of cadres. good character waste - which was the best thing about this movie. The obviously low budget that does not spoil it, the movie does not work at all and I think I'm going to say that - it needs a remake from Hollywood. you simply lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as other French films that go out in recent years as crimson riffs that have been at least noticeable / entertaining, malefique is not prudent to the end to be honest. and I bet you can guess the end before you watch the movie. really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
