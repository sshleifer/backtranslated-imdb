Although the production and direction of Jerry Jameson are clear improvements, "Airport 77" is not much better than "1975 Airport": the commercial dump of manure (this time literally) a decent distribution. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a full-fledged aircraft that is hijacked by art thieves and collapses into the sea (all advertising claimed to be close to the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention in this film). When the rescue ships come to pick up the plane from the water, we see that all their cranes descend (rather blindly) into the ocean, and it's hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes that attack the plan, the passengers and the script with water). NBC used to broadcast what appeared to be "cutting the director," with at least an hour of extra material - especially flashbacks - injected into the process with the subtlety of an "Gilligan's Island" episode. The most exciting moment is the collapse of the plane, and some players have a little fun: Lee Grant is an unpleasant drink, Brenda Vaccaro a worthless stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are getting old. Nevertheless, personality conflicts and bitter military details end up enduring patience. ** from ****
