The only reason I just looked at it was that I found it in my local library (and I would beat them ruthlessly because they scattered public money) and, despite the crowd of boobs and asses, it did not last too much to realize that the fast forward button was my friend. The terrible direction, the pedestrian work of the rooms, the evil-almost-passing sporadic action, the chintzy effects and one of the worst scenarios I had the discontent of bringing you to life (as it was, terribly paralyzed and mutilated) a long time. The best laughter comes from the "Performing ..." feature, in which the poor digs involved in this HDV misery try to justify their blade efforts as if they were working on something special instead of something that will not be complete forgotten next week. Wait! Except that someone somehow lured Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, from all the people, make a small part, along with Kane "Friday 13" Hodder! How did this happen, I will never know, and, honestly, I do not care. Follow your own risk and do not say that you have not been warned. That's the movie to his pretentious, worst. There are only 2 people from me because I have some beautiful naked women and even then only now.
