Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. A top production. Buildings and CGI vehicles well detailed. Evil: The horrible motion of actors with all CGI actors combines the fifth element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors are even worse than video games a few years ago. Logical erosion. A huge pyramid appears and no one searches it, no one even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why Horus was even expelled, and was there no reason why he must do something as ordinary as Jill impregnated? Ugly: <br /> <> Scenario great. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. Dialogue was almost laughing at some points. Unnecessary random characters and events. Dull characters. Jill should be this mystery, but it seems to have been just a mystery for the writer. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to look. It has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is no character in the whole movie that has any purpose, no purpose (besides Horus's obvious), any motivation. They are weak and poorly conceived. There are no stakes - the key to writing on the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but, great thing, he's a bad guy. It can not be deciphered whether Horus or Jill is the main character. This is the problem: dedicating half a movie to each character means that the writer never fully explores a single character, never brings a result. There are cardboard cutters who walk and talk and do nothing but explore the fine pieces. Direction of rhythm for the first time. Slowly, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes useless. Generally: <br /> <br /> It's not worth a watch. Story about the story, the development of sub-par characters, CGI corny does not save pleasant production.
