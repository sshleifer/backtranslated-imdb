I just finished a marathon of this series and became agonizing to look at it as it progressed. From the fictionalization of historical elements to O'Herlihy's dreadful accent in subsequent episodes, the show drops further. If you want a low-quality, generous puff of WW2, I could recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, degenerate into a step in a theater excavation, with increasingly bad lines and sensitivity. <br /> <The old B & W movie is by far the best of any form of entertainment with Colditz's name attached to it, and is not really what you can hope for.
