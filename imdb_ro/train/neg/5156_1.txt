"Laughter is a state of mind," says the label, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's commentary. What could have thought about creating "toys"? When she watched the shame, she saw a fantasy fantastic and funny? If so, then they work on a different plan from me. This is a cross-picture, one in which the production design represents 90% of the things (and even the colors of the cartoons are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul, who are detoured as factory heirs when their father dies. Nothing is fun (satirical or flickering). It's uniformly cute, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
