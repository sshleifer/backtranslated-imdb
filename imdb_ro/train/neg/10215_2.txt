A horrible, and worse, boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most unimaginable stereotypes, and is based on a central concept that is neither original nor in vaguely innovative terms. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is wasted in what he probably hopes to be his Jim Truy's Truman Show response and replaces his usual routine (often very funny if you do Talledega Nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. Emma Thompson is just slightly irritating (some reviews I've read here talking about an Oscar nomination is ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passive job with a very weak script, which allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a law student who gave up Harvard to become a baker because she liked to make people happy. Please. That she has come to fall for Ferrell's "character" is absolutely ridiculous. Marc Forster's attempts to jam in film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired material he needs to work with. > <br /> I had a choice either to watch The Prestige for the third time, or to see that. I wish I had chosen The Prestige.
