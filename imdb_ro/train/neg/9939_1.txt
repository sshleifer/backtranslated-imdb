The film-school intelligence can lower everything he wants about the important (imagined) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: The Intellectual Hall. This film is creative in bankruptcy, and some mistakes are inflamed without any self-indulgence as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because it would have been great. It captures the birth of this timeless song, and instead chooses to cover the music with a guy who reads from a real magician detective or nonsense. <br /> <br /> Then there are endless photographs of what the librarians look like 60 words of painting on people's cars. Then there is the seemingly unfortunate interview, where the actress was brilliantly trained to answer only yes or no to all the deep and intellectual questions. There is a guy in a purple suit who reads a lot of nonsense in a book that goes for, oh, just about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a bacon. Does it almost sound intriguing? Well, it is not. But for misty school movie mice who do not take care of the lost chances of having full access to the Stones, bringing Sympathy for the Devil into the world, and you'd rather hear the English Reading guy while watching the nudy mag, this movie is a true winner! Exactly ... maybe Godard just kicks.
