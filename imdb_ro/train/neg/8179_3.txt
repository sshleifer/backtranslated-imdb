"A trio of treasure hunters seek West Indies for a hidden fortune." Gold leads to an increase in tension as men approach the location of treasure. that the greed and hatred lead to murder, "according to the synopsis of the DVD sleeve." Manfish "is the name of their boat, not a monster, and the skeleton that gives Captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) a Muslim half of the treasure map is very good. The first partner Lon Chaney Jr. (as Swede) is playing stupidly and sexy Tessa Prendergast (as Alita) keeps the rum (not very good, obviously) Serious issues of editing and continuity increase the image that could otherwise have counted. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
