Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was hair. Regardless, this time is not a god's receptacle (see the previous episode), but is a very famous lady with magical powers that allows him to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the most in love with her is a few deck-full books trying to kill Ambassador Medusan (who is weird in a small cage - this is a weird way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldyr is not wrapped very well. What happens next is kinda stupid and until the episode was the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Observing that all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty stupid, and Spock's act when he became mad was quite camouflaged. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show before, choose a different episode.
