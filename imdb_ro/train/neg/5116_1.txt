I hired this movie today thinking that it could be a good football movie because I'm a big fan of football. Well, I was wrong. This movie is too religious and preaches and is indeed unrealistic. This movie says quite a bit that if your Christian can easily get everything you want in life to become a great football player! Do not become a great football player by becoming a Christian and asking God, doing it through hard work and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you everything ... puh-lease. It's not true at all, spirit. I laughed several times because of this fever. The only part that was fun was when they were dumb (Shultz not the cartoonist, guy who flew over the Atlantic, etc etc), but really this movie was not that great. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
