The second in the Vacation series is easily the least pleasant because Clark Griswold wins a family trip to Europe. The beautiful, under the humor of the belt that worked so well for the first time is virtually non-existent here. This mistake lies with director Hackerling, who obviously is not as good as a director like Harold Ramis and a very uninspired script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around. Chevy Chase injects a certain form of life into the process, but it just is not enough and Eric Idle's very funny is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not being met to their full potential and left the viewer mostly aggravated. All the images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universal are not fun at all (such as the way English are polite SOOO). Apart from a few scenarios, there is no laughter in sight and the end turns into one in the complete slapstick. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me), the movie can be watched, but no more than that.
