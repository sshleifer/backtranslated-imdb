Robert Altman, pressed to the west of Edmund Naughton's "McCabe" book, was overlooked at the time of his release, but in recent years he has received a sterling criticism. Aside from a full-city-boom scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the image looks (intentionally) confident and unattractive. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a sixteenth-century entrepreneur who setstles up in the grass-roaring community and helps organize the first brothel; once profits begin to come, Beatty is naturally threatened by the hardness of cities that want to participate in the action. Altman creates a solemn and cute atmosphere for the film, which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this tiny little town is limited - most of the story being made up of vignettes - and Altman's rhythm is deliberately slow. It's not hard to make a statement (just the opposite, in fact), and the lost actors look at each other without much thought. It is a self-defeat image, yet, in a strange way by Altman, it bears defeat with pride. ** from ****
