This is one of two fantastic post-apocalyptic films that Albert Pyun did in 1993 - and he's the bad one. Apparently, all of his energy went into "Nemesis", which was a non-stop action movie and had a much more expensive look. The "Knights" is crazy and cheesy, a sci-fi from the bottom up, which too often resembles a video game (new opponents are always on fire and must be eliminated as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this movie in the trash is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but no doubt a brutally effective combat machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, given his age at that time (58), I hope his doubts were well paid. (* 1/2)
