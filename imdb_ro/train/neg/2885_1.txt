I can not really say what I think about this movie, against the rules, I've watched many movies and that's got to be the worst, the budget is extremely low, I suppose all the money went to the slaughterhouse's house because I could do a job better with an 8 mm camera and a monkey team. It was so bad that I just registered to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, the place to rent the film was not enough. But this is my 2-cent value, I suggest you borrow it from a poor salty man who rented it and looked at her alone. Because sure I would not lose the money again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you did not go to the rental place when they will not refund your money .. =)
