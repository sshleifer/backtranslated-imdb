this movie was a wonderful fantastic movie, all scary as a hell. and I mean that I was scared so much like pulse and IT and the sign etc., but with a great movie comes a stupid thing that ends well? RIGHT! this movie that ended was pathetic. I mean, a ghost has come back to a chicken house and she thinks I've now done that it means I can call her and that's the right time for she thinks she is. right? wrong. my ass! I do not care if the ghost is Satan, it just does not happen. her a yes movie, but most bad movies or praised movies like this are meant to make sense, but it did not. just showed us what I said, and people do not believe anything about it. can anybody tell me why you have not all observed that pitiful part. the movie for me has ended in the hospital, and that's it. check the number 3 with much more
