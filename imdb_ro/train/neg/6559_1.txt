My girlfriend chose that; as an American born and raised African I found the plot of this film and the total premise without credibility. To believe that class and race distortions would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unknown in the southern antebellum. Total absurd !!! I wonder how they had a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who is a well-known man) to participate in this carp
