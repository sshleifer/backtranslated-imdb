He saw a trailer for this movie on another video and decided to rent when it came out. Well, I was disappointed! The story is extremely dull, the act (except for Christopher Walken) is bad, and I'm not interested in characters except that I really want to see Nora's husband. The role of Christopher Walken is such a throw, what the hell!
