as an inspirational director, this movie was interesting to look with criticism in mind. Shot with low-end digital camera, probably with 35 mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good acting decent, sound effects are not too above the top. I would have given a 7 for an indie movie, but the story is not so interesting. It's more on the drama side, characters' evolutions than a horror hit. It is not for those who want to scare scared frightened, or to sit down with popcorn to enjoy. Honest this movie would be good if I was still in the '50s. This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just that.
