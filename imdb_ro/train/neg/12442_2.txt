The invasion of star creatures would certainly be in the "so bad" category if the movie was not so racist or sexist. That it is so simple, it is simply bad. It has the same kind of stereotypical sexism that you have seen in the Queen of the cosmic space and the genre of racist stereotypes (in this case native Americans) that you would normally find in the thirty-forty years of b-Western . From the point of view of the fact that it is not funny, the same gag cave is repeated over ten times during this short film. Ray makes a good impression about Jimmy Cagney (but can not make it work for Cagney's two impressions in turn, nor does he handle Peter Lorre when he tries it). There is, in fact, production values ​​to talk about, as "star creators" make Ro-Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 of the cosmic space seem like creations of Industrial Light and Magic. /> This movie was certainly an avant-garde of what it was supposed to call early independent cinematography ... not sufficiently artistic for those theaters and not good enough for nothing but the last feature of a night-time trip. /> <br />
