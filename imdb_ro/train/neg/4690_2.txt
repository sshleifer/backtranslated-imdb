This British movie is really terrible and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it, though he feels close to sleep. The idea of ​​a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it seems that this train ends parked for most of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is being evacuated, so there is no danger to anyone. In fact, this movie could be used in a movie class to show how NOT to make a suspense movie. True suspense is generated by the fact that it allows the public to know the things the characters do not encounter, an apparently unknown fact to the director. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we are led to believe there is only one. After the first bomb is defused, it seems that there is no longer a reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. We're not even sure when the bombs will disappear, so we do not even have a classical ticking sequence of checked bombs. For 10 minutes or more, he's watching Glenn Ford's French wife thinking of leaving him and then wondering where he is. It's such an annoying character that we do not care if he gets along with him, so when he does, there's nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are pretty lacking in personality, and none have any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it's been a long time since it's boring and boring. Do not waste time.
