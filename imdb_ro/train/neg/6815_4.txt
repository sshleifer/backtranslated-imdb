The eighth Jean Rollin film I have watched is also the weirdest; the intriguing story (as it is) seems to be too weak to even support her 84-minute d√©cor, but to some extent she gets involved in mourning as she goes on! A vampire who was a woman (dressed in shimmering fashion, as the title promised) is held in captivity in a distant castle and only appears to "celebrate" the blood of the void victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) insecure if all this would lead him, the writer-director finally has the bad man? in fact, the bastard's father with the naked face? ridiculously revealed as a mutant (!!) of the future! The luminous rhythm and the dream atmosphere (the cults wear clothes and animal masks to hide their characteristics from the sheltered little girl) are, of course, typical of both the filmmaker (up to the climax of the seashore at the peak) and the style "Euro-Cult", as well as the brilliant beauties on the display. Personally, the most delightful thing about the whole eye-catching, but intellectually attractive business was the pursuit of the familiar actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in Luis Bunuel's last six films) overwhelming once in a while!
