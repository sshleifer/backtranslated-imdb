My husband and I were intrigued by the show - a strong South lady with a disordered personal life resolves crimes for the LAPD. The first season we had to watch on TV for us. Unfortunately the stories of her personal life in the second season have become so boring and worthy of the strong character that I have stopped. My husband and I were disturbed by the episode in which she tried to hide her mother from being shaken. But the destruction of the business was the episode in which she hides the possible task from her lover, but her boss tells her. Why would those things be a strong, middle-aged woman? The answer is he would not do it. Besides, my husband and I choose the bad guy with almost perfect precision. It's almost always a white man or woman introduced into the cameo at the crime scene or in an idealized family. Can not scriptwriters do anything original from time to time? As mentioned, we are no longer spectators. We prefer performances that do not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
