I felt like I once again followed Fast and Furious, but with different actors and a slightly different plot. I'll say the cars in the movie are really cool. So if you like fast cars, you'll probably find this movie easy to enjoy. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her in the Days of Our Life. She is a very good singer, but too bad they gave such terrible songs to sing in this movie. I want to say songs about cars; not exactly what you would do here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little bit, but in real life I do not think any joe will meet a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin who can run a racing car, repair a car , and be a lead singer. It's just really stupid. Another side note, anyone wishing to bet 25 million in a car race, is crazy. But it was pretty cold at the end when Natasha stopped just before the finish line and screwed up Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> VERDICT FINAL: This movie is for weird cars. So if you like fast cars, I would recommend this.
