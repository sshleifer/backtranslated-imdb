Really, very bad. How to make this movie bad? I was waiting for a redeeming pay point, interesting room work, or at least a free nudity, but I did not get anything. I just saw Cabin Fever and thought it was a train wreck (except for nudity and pancakes), but it resembles a genius compared to this danger. The best script doctor in the world could not have saved this rotten pile of poo striding. The only thing that happens for this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid just $ 5 for him and soon he gets into a landfill.
