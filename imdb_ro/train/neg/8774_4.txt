The story: The 4 hour film covers the events of Kargil near the LOC in 1999, when Pakistani infiltrations crossed the LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and Indian Retreats. To learn more about the story, I would suggest readers read Kargil news articles. Comment: If someone is looking for a story story in this movie, then we can be sure it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many and many bullets and blood. The movie room where I saw this movie was full of whistles and cheers when the film shows Indian dare. The audience seemed similar to the audience as in a match against India vs Pak cricket. Watch the film as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and the characterization of real-life war heroes (4 honored PVC heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so that we can see this day. The film made a brilliant representation of the army, which fought with all the odds in unfavorable weather conditions. The negatives of the film are too wide and the songs are extremely dull.
