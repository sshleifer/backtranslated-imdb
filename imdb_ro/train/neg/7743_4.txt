Ford (Martin Landau is one of his customers), Hartnett runs a free-time yoga school, the two are being investigated by Internal Affairs, Ford mistakes Lena Olin's ex-girlfriend (IA) and she is a who has a radio show, the man who killed the club is a former dirty policeman who shot Hartnett's father years ago. binding tracking machines and some humorous lamean attempts, and that's about the essence of this Turk.
