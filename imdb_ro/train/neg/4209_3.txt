"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What is that supposed to mean ?! This plot could not be worse than a boy who feared everything, becoming very brave at the end of the movie because he entered a library. The only purpose of this celluloid scourge was to encourage American children to read when a cheaper and more effective way to do this could have been a series of ads! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin (as a child), Christopher Lloyd (who is so predictable that he is the Page Master librarian), could save this useless film from the boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart (even) Leonard Nimoy or Hollywood Voice Holder Frank Welker as cartoon characters never save him. I can only describe it as a period of 1990, equivalent to the adaptation of the Baby Babe in 1978, because gentle animation makes the movie get worse without improving the boring plot!
