I saw this bomb when it hit the theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because that stupidity seemed to have made me crazy. I look back and understand that it was not funny in the whole movie. Do not leave anything intentional. It's incredibly funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a giant demon carnivore ... however, her little dress is perfectly intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times bigger than she was when she put it on. Or the kind of film in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and falls only unconsciously and returns to consciousness without any medical care. And do not let me start on the ridiculous fate of "bastards" whom they have decided to create "conflict." Uh huh. For the person who complains about Disney only for the children concerned - The sloppy parts of this film seem to remove this claim. Do we really need Daryl Hannah who accuses Jeff Bridges of having video tapes? Make yourself if you are Disney and have no idea to make the movie appeal to the crowd above 8 without writing a clever script! I'm very convinced that Disney pays the ratings board, so movies can escape crime and get family ratings. What loss of DVD format.
