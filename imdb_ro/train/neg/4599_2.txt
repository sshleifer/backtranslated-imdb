The Proverb "Never judge a book on her cover" was invented as a warning for those who fail to look under the surface. <br /> <br /> As we saw artworks at, "King of the Anthurium" I immediately thought HORROR! The arcane images displayed proudly on the cover and back talked about a dark, synoptic vision promised a story of crime, betrayal and revenge. Instead, what we found under that surface was less interesting than what you can find under the medium stone. "King of the Ants" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for him in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is a person you do not care about, I have never felt any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is not at all moved, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) that turns into uninspired performance as the worst through the extremely ridiculous dialogue he is forced to recite. Throw Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (especially for the homeless) and little and no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober norm in Cheers, but MEAN! br /> Now there are some interesting hallucinatory sequences in this movie (the source of the images on the cover), but this movie is never further in the world. She prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, a bad dialogue, and an unlikely event after an unlikely event. Oh Horror!
