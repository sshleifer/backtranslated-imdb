I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy may be affected, but I was disappointed with the lack of the DVD menu screen. I will say that my first reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. While I was fun to watch, I feel she did not respond to my expectations that we have found so far in her other films. In fact, I was just as excited to see Arkin in a humorous show. The other two actors were not very familiar, so they can not compare their performance, however they were quite enjoyable as well. Act is the only hot quality of this movie in my opinion. The story line, while some might say slightly convincing, did not have the direction. I think the main problem comes from the scenario and not the direction of this film. If you enjoy to a sufficient extent any of these actors, then I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
