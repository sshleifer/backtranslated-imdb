Just badly good old. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not stupid like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood movies, this is probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen. To give this film a golden Turkish is an insult to the turkeys. To name this bad movie is offensive even for bad people. If this is the future of American cinema and art, we better start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cocks perform the show after. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult with a single braincell. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you are suicidal.
