Can anyone make good movies for CGI next to Pixar? I mean, the animation seemed to go beyond the 2006 standards and even the 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their budget on Hugh Jackman. Regardless of their reasoning, the story even sucks. Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat that is shattered on a toilet. Yeah, I know, it sounds stereotyped. But then the sewers imitated the ways of London - to some extent. Throw into a promise of jewelery (????) and a toy frog (?) And you will get a pathetic attempt to entertain. I'd like to say something that's fun. Maybe the link in the movie? Or maybe the happy-after-rat relationship. But nothing did. He had the talent, but he exploded. D-
