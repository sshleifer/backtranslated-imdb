This film refers to a group of extraterrestrial homosexual black men exterminating females on Earth to create a gay universe. I watched him with the intention of seeing how bad he was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie made 50 years ago. The action, if any, is very bad. Sets and annoyances are so ridiculously false, making any college film go to the mega budget. And the special effects are simply simple, really jaw dropping, as others have commented, but the jaw dropping shame. You have to be very intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness to appreciate this movie. If I were from Denmark, I would have been embarrassed and humiliated by the fact that my compatriots produced such an awful bad film.
