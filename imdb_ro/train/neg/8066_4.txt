Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night in a full moon full of convictions, I lead and stand on a slippery and twisting mountain road. They do not look properly that they were caring in another car and one or more of them were killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Very bad and fair in the horror movie without gore and nudity. It is obviously influenced by the Carnival of Souls. Cinematography is decent, unfortunately there is zero suspicion.4 out of 10 - just another garbage instantly forbidden for boys.
