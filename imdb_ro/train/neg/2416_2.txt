2 stars, and I am generous. (Minor Spoilers) Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie set in the Oakland gangland. As happens in the plot, a scientist wishes to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a car. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what zombies? All the "zombies" do is snarled (which does not even sound remotely frightening) and dripping fake red blood from their mouths! They are not scary eyes, no fallen flesh, just a bunch of people who are pitiful and running like idiots. The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so it's not like the whole "hood" is affected by the zombie or anything else, it's just a few, and it's content in the shortest time. it's so bad he's hilarious. Nobody can act in this movie (except for the band members) and it seems that a bunch of friends have gathered, decided to throw their family and made a movie in a weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: Since doctors wore trainings? Jump over this, please!
