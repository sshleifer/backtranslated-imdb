Okay, how's that for the original? That means, the rich old man leaves his adult children, all ungrateful and two frightening minions, provided he spends his week in his old house. What will happen that night will only surprise those who have never seen a movie or television show ever. After a series of murders in which the victims show that bleeding the ketchup in the restaurant, we have a painfully obvious overturn. The cast is led by some respected actors who must have been desperate for their salaries. There are also some secondary actors who were rising at that time, but who have been forgotten now. As a result, the film generates all the dramas and mystery of a "Matlock" episode. I'll give credit if it's due - the closing scene is smart and fun, if you're still awake.
