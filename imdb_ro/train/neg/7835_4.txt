Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I am starving for a good TV and applaud TNT for offering these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority that I think when it comes to Stephen King cinema. As brilliant as the King's writing, the irony is that it simply does not translate well on screen, big or small. With a few exceptions (very few), King's experience can not be shot with the same impact that stories have when they read. Many people do not agree with this, but I'm sure that in their hearts, they have to admit that the best story of the filmed king is just a pale memory of the one I read. The reason is simple. The average story of the king takes place in the thoughts of the characters in the story. He gives us a look at their inner thoughts, their emotions and their points of view sometimes fractured or unreal. In short, the king takes the reader's places where you can not put a Panavision room. As an audience that follows the movie king, we have less than half of the information the reader has access to. There is not too far a stretch to say that One becomes a character in a story of the king I read, while One is limited to the little voyeurism of the same character when filmed. As long as the King writes, Hollywood will try to pull everything that comes out of his word processor without considering whether or not he should. They do not blame the producers to try, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to eliminate Stephen King's evasive adaptation. The task is close to turning lead into gold or some Zen mastery. Well, better luck next time.
