After I was pleasantly surprised by Miss Congeniality's Sandra Bullock show, I decided to offer a shot at Murder By Numbers. While she is decent in role-playing roles, Mrs. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) leaves much to be desired. Her character is, at the same time, omniscient, confused and inappropriately sexual (Sandra's past sub-plot meets as a futile stuff that does little to develop her already superficial character). The two adolescent boys have provided decent performances, although forensic expertise and the fascinating attitude of the Meschan is contrary to silly errors that shout "I did it!" Chris Penn, as an absolutely obvious suspect, is scattered here, just like Ben Chaplin's partner / love. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** Mediocre, watched on a week-long TV plot that never made a full purchase of the motives of the crime and, as mentioned, silly errors (shedding a rare food on the scene of crime, the school driver, the two boys that happen together in the public, the interest of the good love to provoke friction, etc.) causes the vision to go from being intrigued to boredom and disappointment by killers. The ending was strictly "By Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using the accumulated tactic to show the near-climatic scene at the beginning of the movie and then to fill the audience the way we came at that moment, the final scenes did not surprise anyone and did not have any of the so-called intelligence the alleged movie to conclude . A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost any way. * of ****.
