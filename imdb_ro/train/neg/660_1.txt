Good pain I can not even begin to describe how poor this movie is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect to start too much. Let's face it, a shot of PG-13 is preconditioned for lack of swelling ... so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. But it was the level of incompetence and the clichus shown in all the other aspects of this film is what really conquered me. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless that you are rooted for the evil guy. Here's the appearance of the books ... NEVER CHANGE - therefore, violation of the cardinal rule of writing the base screen - character development. If you think that by the end of this movie, the poor little girl will come back and finally kick her ass back and think again. <br /> <br /> Above all, we have probably handed out the least intriguing (and certainly the most frightening) killer ever to pardon the genre. I'm not kidding when I say Dora Explorer is worse than a movie. Finally, because all the potential for tension or freeness is eliminated by those who are incessantly (and apparently thirteen), what could be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? <br /> <br /> Closets, that's what. <br /> <br /> A lot of cabinets: large cabinets, small cabinets, mirror cabinets, cabinets for Narnia, so many miserable cabinets do not want to dress for another year. In fact, this movie should have been called "CLOSET", and had a big hairdresser image in the DVD case. On the back, he could have had a photograph of the public who had fallen asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent that: "What has lost our time!"
