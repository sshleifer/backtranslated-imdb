I notice that the previous reviewer (which still seems to be in school) gave this film a very good review, and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer did not see the much higher BBC adaptation of this classic novel in 1989 . The big issue I had with this release (1999) was the release of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented little boy who shot her after appearing in the mini-TV series "The Chorus". I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long, based on his excellent acting in the "Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in the "Choir" grew up in a tall and gangling young man until "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony fails to convince Tom. It's too far from the imagination to think that Tom (as interpreted by Anthony) will make friends with Hatty much younger. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty are much closer to their age, and the development of their friendship is much more credible. For a 1999 film, even the special effects fail to convince and there is no visible improvement on the 1989 TV effects. The casting and interpretation of this version are inferior to previous adaptation, and everything in the movie was a glossy version of a true classic . As a final remark, I would like to point out that the BBC version of the BBC version of 1989 brings much more than £ 20.00 a second, while a new DVD of this version can be bought under £ 5.00, I have to say more?
