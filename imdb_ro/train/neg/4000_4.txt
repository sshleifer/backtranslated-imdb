I liked "American Film," so I hired Chris Smith's first film, which I also considered documentary. In the first minute, I saw it was not, but I let go. What a deadly movie. Being true-to-life is hard to see if you just look at boredom, esp. tedious that we are already familiar with. I'm sorry, but it will come as a reference for Anyone that 1) a lot of job sucks and 2) most of them are crappy, the minimum wage jobs in the service sector ??? I knew that before I saw the movie. However, he did not offer an examination of this, because as the movie struggles to feel "real" (handheld camera, music, etc.), what happens does not play as it is in the " the real world. " <br /> <br /> An employer would be so cheerful to Randy when he took his check after Randy gave up after three days when the guy said he expected him to stay for 6 months? Or a day after he left his job (and deceived the car he was working on), everyone would be so easy on him? A big problem is "our hero" (?), Randy. This guy's a loser. Not because he stuck in these jobs or has a flat or looks like one. It's a drug. He does not pay attention or really do not really try these jobs. She has zero personality. If I had to hire someone, he would not have gone through the interview. I look forward to what Chris Smith does, but boys, beat "this is an important film". "American Job" does not work.
