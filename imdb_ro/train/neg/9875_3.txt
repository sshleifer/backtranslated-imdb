Brilliant technology. But what good does it if the content is empty and crazy. I left after more than 30 minutes of watching, being bored and irritated. <br /> <br /> The theater administration has turned my money back, but the remaining time and worsening have remained. I was and I did not thank stars whose name was the main attraction. <br /> <br /> George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you were well paid. He may have liked that. So I apologize for my limited mind. Many people seemed to like them too. Look at the comments. Well ... I want to know - what is remotely redeemed in a story about Mr. Fox, husband, father, citizen, ... anything.
