We just visited the Russian TV channel of our channel that showed this movie. Well ... 99% of the active audience in Russia is disappointed. We wanted to see more real facts about our space achievements in this movie. But the authors had something else in mind ...: (We are a great and beautiful country with intelligent people living here.) We are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements, on the one hand, in this field and science, on the one hand I would like to ask the authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? Where is Hell, our MIR station? I am sure the LUNOHOD events took place much earlier on Armstrong's "walk on the moon" and the scientific mistakes - not I have too much time and space here!
