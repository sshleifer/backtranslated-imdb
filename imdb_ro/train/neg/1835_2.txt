Start with the script. I've seen cartoons deeper than "Envy". Whenever the characters continue to repeat what you've seen before and was not funny for the first time, a movie is in a deep problem, certainly "Envy". A film based on a joke would have better go somewhere with him. Here we have a movie that goes absolutely nowhere. In particular, Christopher Walken would like to forget this bomb, because its character is so weak. Ben Stiller was in some unfortunate comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex," which come to mind immediately. Be sure Envy is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, only total nonsense. "Envy" deserves a low note because, as the subject is, it moves. - MERK
