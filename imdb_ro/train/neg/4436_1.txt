I gave this movie a 1 (Great) rating. The only reason why he should get even 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines no matter what terrible material is thrown his way.Mira Sorvino is so from her element here as a spectator, simply can not overcome the fact that it is even in such a piece. Stupid, bad story and horrible production. Do not miss your video rental video $.
