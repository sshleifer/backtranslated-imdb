I wanted to like this movie, it's a SAW, bla blah blah ripoff but I like those movies. If you did this well it had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good movie ... unfortunately these ingredients have gone! The act was terrible, and this was first encountered when the captives are introduced together with their captor one by one (the disconnected caps), the remarks and a gasket are just terrible, yes, I know, writing bad ... but that's it was more of a bad writing, coupled with a bad action. Two of the captives were in a relationship with each other and they did not even recognize it until much more in the movie ..... Sorry, I was wondering why I was bothering to review this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I'm going to end up with PLOT, HOLES PLOT and a lot of holes! DISAPPOINTING!
