The reason I intended to give this film a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and certainly appreciate the Indian cinema. All I've ever seen is a few older films by S.Ray. Navigating through IMDb I've come across this and after seeing a 8.7 rating, I've come to the conclusion that it must be the one that will open the unknown doors and bring artistic pleasure. Oh, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this 8.7 rating is that most of the 970 voted people are Indians and their only business outside of Bolliwood's production was Adam Sandler's films. With this assessment, this film would rank 9th on IMDb. The best 250 movies above Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I am not really willing to review and criticize, because there is nothing to remind me of this painful experience. My only hope is that there are a lot of Hindus who, like me, find this movie as it is - badly stupid, with a lot of kitsch and cheesy music.
