I imagine that young people involved in the "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a strange beast on a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play "The Cradle Will Rock"); has scared people to believe that aliens invade ("World War"); and directed and starred in the greatest film of all time ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles was the one who played in a stage of a ritual stage about a satanic cult. There is nothing creative about this movie. A lot of nudity, but background music always proves to be very distracting. Even though the movie was not particularly predictable, it still does not deserve to see it. How low was Welches. Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, he has told the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about Warner Bros. cartoons in the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man Who Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not the one. Just avoid it. Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
