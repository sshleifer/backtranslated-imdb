The book on which this film is based has changed my life seriously. But saying that this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. Act, direction, cinema and story were horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I told him countless people about the book, but now he will tell everyone that he should not see the movie! I did not expect the plot to follow the book, but left too many key parts of the book. The film tried, but failed, to send a strong and inspired message and only distorted the core theme of prophecy. While I was dealing with the position that did not read the book, I saw the Celestine prophecy as a bunch of rage B.S. I'm very disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out.
