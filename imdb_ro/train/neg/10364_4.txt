The book is so good that at least the opening of this film made for television will move you, but then, as it deviates more and more from the book, pulling all religion and love and math and putting cotton candy, it becomes boring. However, from the comments I have heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it even takes the child to read a Wrinkle in Time, it will be served for its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Environment a clone of Mary Poppins' uncle Albert (I like to laugh). Nothing is so messed up that the characters on the screen laugh laughing at things that are totally inappropriate.
