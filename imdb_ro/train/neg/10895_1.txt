I've seen many bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a terrible movie about what it is. But this really has a rage at new extremes. It is unclear, the plot for what never really goes anywhere and takes time on it. There are no shocks, no horror, no suspense, just a bunch of boys rubbing for an hour and a half and then a quick finish. A strike on the terrible horror genre, avoiding at all costs. <br /> <br />
