Oh, God, you must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve years old (do not ask how) we were young, but I was not stupid. Anyone can see that this is a bad, ugly, brutal, inappropriate and very stupid film. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performance at a school, and I've seen more crocodiles convicted at the zoo where they just sit in the water, ignoring the kids touching the glass. The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people try a new sport on the water, sailing in shark-filled waters. Soon it becomes obvious that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning what, it helps a middle-aged grizzly who wants to kill the animal to avenge his family's food. I think we have seen every crocodile movie made in the last fifteen years, of which the best is Lake Placid, and the worst is its sequel. The blood surge should be the second worst crocodile movie I think, with Primeval and the wild crocodile behind him. The Australian saltwater crododils are one of the most dangerous creatures there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths each year. Movies like Blood Surf, however, destroy not only the fierce image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. Unless you want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
