This could be unbelievable, but this film has amounted to $ 878,138 in Russia! It is featured in almost all cinemas and is still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors have looked at this "film", which has almost no screening around the world. It's kind of an enigma! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was just released on DVD almost everywhere, had important projections in Russia and earned more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films have had a lot of promotion, as if they were banners across the city, TV commercials, and more. Speaking about the movie, I'd say it's boring and absolutely boring. It could be better, indeed. Even if she's Jessica Simpson.
