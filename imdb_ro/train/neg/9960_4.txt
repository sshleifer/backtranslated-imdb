MY BROTHER TOM Appearance: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an episode of sexual abuse in the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica ( Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) he meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has his own secrets, no less worrying and much more dangerous ... a tough drama triggered by brave performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two related spirits sink into a mutual love of nature after having they were traumatized by their experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship is unleashed as a harsh reality that begins to penetrate, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital format, the film seems to be tattered in places (too many awkward shots and hand movements) and it takes a while to find its feet, but the dramatic pleasure is quietly enjoyable.
