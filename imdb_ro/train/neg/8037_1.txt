OK, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid film of weakness. We took your stereotypical teenagers to a house we're going in. We have an FBI agent who has seen too much of Dirty Harry. - So what's the secret ... punk? We have about 4 different shots and a scene that makes no sense. "Hey man, I'm repairing sprinklers" ((which guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there is a preacher tied on a couch watching movies at home, he is killed. <br /> <br /> Follow the killer in the middle of nowhere without any cop. she suddenly is in a church, wearing a bridal dress. I swear it's the stupidest slasher movie I've ever seen.
