You want to watch Dead Gentlemen Productions' The Gamers. This is not the movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. All the good comments here seem to be written by fake third parties (disguised). The people who made this film seem to try to synthesize the false interest. This film is not a good mockumentary. Comparisons with Spinal Tap or Christopher Guest are insulting. The movie is so bad that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject that finds it funny. Being able to laugh at you is an important quality, but if you are the ones who are praised in this way, you will have to hate yourself to enjoy it. The film is not offensive because of its great satire of taboo subjects, but because of its constant pathetic banality.
