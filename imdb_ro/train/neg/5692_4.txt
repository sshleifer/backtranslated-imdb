Disappointment of the action movie with an interesting concern: a young mafia who should be a killer (Chandler) has to prove to his boss that he is a good man for work, so he goes to California to take some lessons with a well-known killer (Beluschi ). The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee), which is completely strange for all. But is it an easy target? The film continues and relies on this main idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even strange twist at the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I gave 4 (four).
