This is the worst documentary ever to come out of Canada !!!! I'm glad to see the guys did not make another movie. All they want to do is make a movie and do not have to be the one they wrote. They continue to change the script to fit the person they are doing. We could not get out of the theater pretty quickly when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Never watch this movie.
