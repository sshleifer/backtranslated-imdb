I had no other expectations than to have fun for 90 minutes and that's exactly what I was. Of course it is the plague, of course some dialogues were not perfect, of course the "special effects" were a bit hokey. That's why I really liked the movie. It's a perfect fit for this classic 70-Horror genre. Talent has to start somewhere, what happens to actors and crew and what better material to improve your skills than that. I'm looking for another movie from these producers and directors.
