I'll be blonde to the point. This movie is not good at all. The part of the bestial film in the film hated my act, script, story, direction, and almost all editing. Amanda Peet has shown she can act because it was a peak point for The Whole Nine Yards. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten-foot pillar. However, my childhood has found this movie very funny. If you can forget how subtle the quality of production is and if you find fun funny jokes, then you should be fine. And for those of you who can not get out of your pedestal, that's your choice. My inner child did not die and I laughed a little. Even then, only 3 out of ten, because as a movie, indeed, it moves.
