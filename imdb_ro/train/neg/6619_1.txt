This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in cinema! I could not wait to finish. To make things worse, you get a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone shot, only the bodies that collapse on the ground, even if Babban was killed was cut! Too many scenes have been cut to bring younger viewers because they think the producers knew they would flop disastrously! The actor of Amitabhs was great, but that "Bastian" and the other idiot playing Devgan's partner can not even act. Devgan was wasted! I could not watch this again and I advise everyone else who reads this to do exactly the same You were warned !!
