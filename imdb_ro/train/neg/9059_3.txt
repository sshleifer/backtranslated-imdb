I will be simply vague about my potential observations. There are plenty of plotting elements preserved in this film that are essentially pre-blown. This film derives from some ideas from a classic Southern, "A Kill A Mockingbird". I suppose maybe TKOM took his ideas from a certain source ... in any case, after you look at it, you will say, "Oh yes, that's a ripoff." The fun thing about these McMovies is once you have identified a plot element, is to figure out whether they will stick to the original or try to twist it around. There is a lot of twists in this.
