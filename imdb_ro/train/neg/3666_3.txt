This is a very confusing film. The film is very hard to follow, and the plot does not seem to make any sense. Wolfman's anger was made in Spain, and I think when a film is copied from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was for the first time. Maybe this is part of the problem, but I doubt if he can explain all the problems with this movie. Dubbing is pretty bad and voices do not match the characters very well. The scenes are tangled, there are a series of strange and irrelevant characters that do nothing but confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this movie was the look of the wolf himself and the scenes he was attacking. Now if he could put everything together and make some sense, he might have something. Do not waste time with this.
