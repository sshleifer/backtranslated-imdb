The best of the best 4, is better than 3, but barely. In principle, I say this because Part 4 does not contradict parts 1/2 (such as 3 no), (that is, it is not a reference to Tommy Lee having brothers). Anyway, I liked the Russian plot story line, especially the part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. Apart from this, and a few scenes of fighting, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very visible (especially in the aircraft scene). Also, part 4 does not really have a moral character or does not say anything like a part 3 did, there are several more known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in the 4th but unfortunately not it's about the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). Rhee looks, and to be true, he can not have a movie. Saw on tape, Rating: 4
