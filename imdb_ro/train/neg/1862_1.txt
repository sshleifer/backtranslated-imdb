It's not just the single plot that makes this movie an instant stop for the bored audience. It's the terrible direction, with a horrible scenario and mistakes left and right, which makes it too agonizing to look. I'm sorry, but I do not see the "fun" in it. Just the thrill of showing many stupid mistakes and tools. Well, I wonder how bad the directors of their producing company think when this film was first introduced. Probably as bad as the sheriff who slipped into the antifreeze truck with a bloody wound. Oops! Did I forgot to mention that this sheriff is not just a poor actor but can also lift a tram with a charge of antifreeze that moisten the exposed meat? I think he forgot something when he won a remarkable victory over the snowman.
