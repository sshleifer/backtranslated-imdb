"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the Kung Fu genre. To comprehend this confusing filmmaking with the inspirational madness and the quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. First, battle scenes are nothing new. Everything that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Intelligent Motion Motion fights need logic. It seems to be pointless to serve blows that have no damaging effect, as happens in the sequel to "Matrix". Yu Yoon's wife drew the screen's attention, but did not convincingly conquer the physical requirements of Ziyi Zhang's role so easily in the "House of Flying Daggers." Having a martial art background serves Kung Fu movies well. Casting inexperienced actors into these abilities is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi") if you are not a very talented director that "Arahan" proves to be not Seung-wan Ryoo.
