Words can not describe how bad these movies are. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least he had some beautiful and occasional good chin pictures that made a moment to stop you from nodding. This is just ridiculous! Terrific scenario, bad direction, terrible action and you know what? I can not think of a single thing to recommend anything but that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of fun, book with your dentist and do a root canal job - much more enjoyable and much better for the money (assuming you need it!). Besides, I have to enter 10 rows of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. IT'S TERRIBLE!
