This movie is not that funny - such a waste of big stars that seem to be caught in so much of their own stardom that they forget. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who likes to get dressed - you almost fell off your chair with a helpless laugh when dancing "Don Girls" at Donna Summer, while wearing high heels mink coat and a nice hat. The rest: Understand it!
