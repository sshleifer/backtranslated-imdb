Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and is up to a Jack (Crackerjack) policeman to stop this. A B-action movie that borrows from other movies and is pretty good with good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid B-act movies, it's not for you.
