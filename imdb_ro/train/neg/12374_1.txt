I do not remember seeing another crime / mystery movie as bad as this one. This movie, about a medical examiner investigating the mysterious death of a friend in a car accident, has a complete receipt for a bad movie: bad action, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and drama. I remembered seeing the film on PAX, a notable TV post for low budget budgets and a TV campaign like this one. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or suspense as Big Screen movies. But, this movie has hit all sour tastes. Producers of this film missed an opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" an excellent television movie; the title gives some suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie alone can kill TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Grade F
