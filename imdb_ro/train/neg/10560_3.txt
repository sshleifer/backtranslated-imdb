A lot of other commentators here, among whom many, whose opinions I respect, keep this horrible European horror. I personally did not like it at all. An incoherent attempt to do so in the cross-poll of sex and violence. Jess Franco at the best movie makes these films very well. Unfortunately, the infamous exploited director Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's most well-known films are infamous for their high coefficient. This, an early film by him, does not have the constant disgusting scene of his most notorious "Anthropophagus" and "Beyond the Darkness". Finally, an incoherent film that fails to involve the viewer in any way. Without the dormant factor, it becomes very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this film, but we just found it as a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. There are a few pluses for the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it, and she looks hot enough and is often naked. However, Klaus Kinski's worship icon is completely wasted in a subplot unrelated to the main movie. He seems bored with the role and does not have the manic intensity he does at the best. The score of the music is beautiful and there are some short moments of unintentionally funny gore. However, this is a pretentious and useless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
