There will be a time when children will be raised without ever seeing the only one and only Bugs Bunny kisses (technically) another man on his lips. There will be a time when there will not be the Duck or Rabbit season. There will be a moment when the Tazmanian Devil will be politically called incorrectly. But help me now is not that time. No one really wants an "EXTREME" version of our beloved characters. Anyone in marketing that comes with "Corn Nuts: Corn went wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and obviously this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or anything else does not mean that Jack knows about the kids. I think they are serving children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me and it's not just about the dated artwork or the terrible dialogue. They abuse the good talent of the voice, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and many others. It is devoid of style, humor, character development and, most importantly, of the heart. The show, as well as the repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just a shadow of the former, handsome self.
