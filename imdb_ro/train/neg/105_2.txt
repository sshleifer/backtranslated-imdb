There are a lot of beautiful women in this movie. But, unfortunately, this movie is free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. Then why the hell are the main characters driving a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, whoever? As you probably know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is the most hideous effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone has done bad for this, but there was no 3D, just double visible blur. I did not have the same problem with other company's 3D movies, AGE SEASON and SEMNUL CAMP. Sure, the 3D in those also sucks, but with them I could see a 3D effect. This is a big ball of nothing. And whoever the women were the ones who played the lady's daughter who eats ear, yum! I'd like to see more of it. In the movies, too. It looks like Janet Margolin from a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
