Bored, long, demanding, repetitive, self-involved? this movement felt once inappropriate. Worse, the boring art-school direction - with a heavy hand being used by the blow that is beginning to get so hard to make me stand up - continues to cry out to be noticed. Add the thinnest of plots and practically no dialogue and the movie starts to feel like a four-hour episode about 30 minutes in. It gets worse: instead of dialogue there are poor written voices and quotations and songs that comment too clearly on the characters. Very loud opera music too. Blame everything to the director. The actors are pretty good. The main actor, Miguel Angel Hoppe, is particularly suited for a film story. He and the other actors have erotic moments. Even they begin to get bored after 5 minutes, but one wonders if the director hears a Bel Ami porno job. The amazing architecture of the college campus, as a location in Mexico City, is inspired. Why are the US universities so mild (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD for this movie. Would you like to use the quick scan button? a lot.
