One of the major flaws of this film is that, while the mockery of the pretentious yuppi is satisfactory, he fails to realize that movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be mocked. One of the features of these types of yuppie is the terrible misunderstanding that they (yuppii) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their disagreements of dining, it seems ironic to me that only those who enjoy this film enjoy the same taste in movies as the characters in their choice of supper . If these pompous characters who were in this movie have a home video library, I would have bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
