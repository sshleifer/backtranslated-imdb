Hello. this is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is literal enough, the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. I feel like the movie has been made funny, which will give it an understanding because of budget constraints in its realization. I felt like watching a very bad remake of the movie. What I can agree, also saw is also very graphic, but, I liked the movie seen. The scene where he takes the hammer at the victim's head bound in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've ever seen. the scene lasted almost forever, in fact, it was probably around 5 minutes, but still. I want to remind myself that I like horror movies and give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll, and his group of people used to make this film should think before making another similar to it. a final note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PERSONS WHO WOULD GIVE THE SALVATION OF HIGHLY DAMAGE, BUT ROT, WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AND A FIVE-MINUTE SCENES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIKE CHILDREN WITH HAMMER, then you will enjoy this film if no, and you will love horror, go with a larger budget movie, as seen for example. I can not believe people make such films. anyway, I'm sorry for anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion about the movie.
