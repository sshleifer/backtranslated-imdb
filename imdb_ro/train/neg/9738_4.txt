Not as bad as it was credited to be (Hooper did much worse) ?? more disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, to which Hooper has never been inclined to his economic direction, and even less to the smokes (excuse). She is so sinister and outnumbered in a deadly tone, becoming ridiculous and unyielding, allowing the whole pessimistic narrative of mystery / conspiracy to teleport easily to end on something completely abrupt. For this reason, the rhythm continues to be slow and Brad Dourif (chilled to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with unbalanced performance despite the fact that he has shone a strange intensity in his extra-color character . Even if it is cheap, there is a technical attitude to it. However, he does not seem to go anywhere out of order with his idea and wants to cling to ugly shocks (which some do) and special effects of steaming (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper displays some angry images (more to the last one), and camera work is handled quickly, and the noise score is printed. The shows are entirely in the store, with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also, Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but funny cameos? especially Landis. Nothing is surprising, but it is punishable by the employee.
