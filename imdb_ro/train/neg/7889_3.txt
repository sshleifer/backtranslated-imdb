I just finished watching this movie. It was not ridiculous, but I'm really disappointed with it. I'm not sure why anyone would make such a movie. It was a little fun, but I feel like the people who did it had a lot of disagreements about what they were doing. On Monday, the writer was responsible; Tuesday, the director; On Wednesday, the guy receiving the coffee; etc. Apparently seems to have really wanted to make a number of different movies, but it only had time and money to make one. Someone commented that the acting was very good, but I should have disagreed. Then, once again, if actors managed to keep a straight face during filming, they are probably better actors than credit. to be a mystery ... something along a law and historical order or a national treasure. It starts this way, but then, from nowhere, it takes a twist to a bad episode of the Twilight area, or ... what other show was not as good ... An evil episode of the outer boundaries. My main complaint about the film is that it's just so much played. He's the bad guy with white hair. It is the interest of love, which, when it first appears, the wind blows through her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it is a Christian movie, the end is also quite easy to see. Cinema was poorly made, especially in opening scenes - a way to put your best foot forward. It was not horrible for most of the movie, but was occasionally shot by an old woman praying her arms raised in a dark room, while the lightning is striking - a kind of thing that makes you a little embarrassed to watch the movie.
