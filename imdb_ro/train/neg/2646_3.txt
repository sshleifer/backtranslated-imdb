When someone enters a film of this type of film, it's not self-evident that an overdose of that extraordinary brain-medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, comes in handy. Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman Nelson Eddy ignored since the beginning of time but who is also an angel sent to Earth. My reaction when I saw this was an emotion of "Hunh?" Where have we seen this before? Looks like we've seen it before, but in a movie later than that. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a bunch of wetties since 1987, collected on the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart who had no lines of speech, wearing a blond wig and making hell of life for the Michael Knight soap maker. Much worse at any imaginable angle with ultra-low values ​​of the 80's, but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey. However, not to elaborate, it's not a memorable film and it's a door because Macdonald and Eddy, the last time, no good actors, but extraordinary singers, would be together to play the romantic "innocence" and "clean" for which they were known. After that, you may need a cold shower, not because there are steam scenes here, but to get rid of memory.
