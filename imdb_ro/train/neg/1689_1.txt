Wow, what a total left off! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rupture of the "Ring". The story? Was it one? Not in my opinion ... Just a bunch of imaginable images. The whole movie was a dull, stupid mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I have seen over the years. And Buffy chicken? She's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and as talented. No, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talent! I suppose many kids helped this box office movie as PG-13, and if it had been rated R, it would have bombarded IMO! Movie stupid!
