I was unhappy to watch this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This film sucks! Lack of the first. You can actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is miserable, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned and were terrible, fortunately the prince did not have many lines that l They kept you from silly sounds. Basically, it is like the Lion King 1 1/2, except for different stories, all told by mice. The reason I give this one 2 out of 10 is that the songs that did not play the characters were the most enjoyable.
