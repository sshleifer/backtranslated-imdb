I liked "Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and I was hoping this would be just as funny, but unfortunately it was not. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy, Champ Kind, confessing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car full of other members of the news team, was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he just gets louder and louder and finally Kisses Burgundy, who do not recognize either. But, in general, the story does not gel. It's a noble attempt to save the unused bits of the first film, including an intriguing whole about fairly benign terrorists who would have been called the "Alarm Clock." Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has some funny lines, but basically this unused land line has a good reason to be unused in the first movie. The excerpts on this disc are quite good, the best two being the rehearsals shot with a lot of improvised comedies, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an "executive producer" that Ferrell discovers early was not even a part of the movie any form, shape or form. It seems to be "just a guy" who entered the studio door and claimed to be a producer. There are some pretty funny things and it takes about 10 or 15 minutes
