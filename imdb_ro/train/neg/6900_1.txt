I just stood in the theater bored as a hell, I wanted to go to the middle of the movie. The plot is simple. 4 Weddings from Samoa are Weddings. So she has to get a date to get into the wedding. Yawn. What was most comforting for me was so-called cruel jokes ... They were extremely amazing, clustered and thrown in front of you to get you into the already boring movie. The actor was under the media and I felt that this movie continued and did nothing but a bunch of unpleasant jokes and a predictable plot. On the whole, one of the worst movies I've seen since 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just nasty. Well, thank God a friend called me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
