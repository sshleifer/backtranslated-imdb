Too many secondary bypasses without a primary one. Too many hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they managed to make this boring film that does not say anything with every element of drama that exists there: death, divorce, money problems, parents' problems, suicide, psychological problems, adoption, rejection of love, travel problems, sex, misconceptions of generations, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? You'd think it would make an interesting movie, right? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture addressed to the child at the end of the movie is total stupidity. Sin. He forgot to mention: the actors, all, are pretty good. That prevents me from stopping him. To destroy their talents, they were lost, the movie is well shot: light, movement, etc. each episode - that's all in place. It's just the missing meaning.
