Losing Control is another offer like the erotic thriller, which could be considered as the fiction of the world's film pulp. Typically, they involve a path directed to a criminal intent, intertwined with abundant disorder. This is not a complaint, especially when it is made by the amazingly beautiful women who invariably live in this world full of beliefs. Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers a war of the writer. Just happening (or is it?) Meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. Man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to stop the business. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott), thinks she will do wonders for book sales. As with most of this type of film, denouement is coming to an end, but some things are not added. I've seen enough such movies to think, no change there, then - but I like it. They are so unusual. Cast performance varies. Doug Jeffery plays the film as a psycho / sociopath that you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince her that the woman is in danger. Clay Greenbush, as PI, has never convinced. Finally, a caution with regard to the examined DVD. Both the cover and the disc have a R operating time and an operating time of 93 minutes, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why sexual scenes seem to be truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is cut off as she begins. 4 stars.
