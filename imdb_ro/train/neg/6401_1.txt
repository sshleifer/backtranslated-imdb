Can I do that until I need glasses? at least proves that anyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. People who have unleashed this pile of shedding on the world have no appearance of talent, taste or intelligence. The target audience should be formed recently by boys and infants playing with their own faeces. Anyone else would be too wise in the world to even get a snicker out of this movie. It consists of a series of sophisticated skittles in which the punchline does not extend to clear. It ends in ridicule. The bankers said are the types of jokes that elemental school children (usually potted or sexually) reveal, where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like my father's car and my mother's garage. Applying any insignificant criticism would be useless, as the usual standards of acting, writing, correcting, and never hearing the creative minds. behind this mess. Not to be a judge, but anyone who enjoys this film should seriously reflect on their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
