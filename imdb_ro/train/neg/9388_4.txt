The former private guard, who became the youngest lieutenant, immediately offered him the chance to return to his previous profession. His mission: to queue a mysterious new French woman in California ... and apparently wanted by costumes and ties. An unsuccessful attempt to update the genre of the film noir without having enough sting or spirit (or involving the dynamics of the plot) in the scenario. Director and co-scriptwriter Paul Magwood (who subsequently claimed the photo was edited without his involvement) does not seem to have a great deal of attention to the 1940s whose "Chandler" was supported; his nostalgia is duly stiff, but bitter and a little indifferent. Handling is curious, with a remarkable price, and Warren Oates is well presented as the '70s' archetype of the "private dick," but the film has no moment. I'm glad to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Graham in the cast - although none of them has much to do, and Caron's hot and cold character is exasperating throughout his life. Live Cinema by Alan Stensvold, a beautiful photo, but fails to boil. * 1/2 from ****
