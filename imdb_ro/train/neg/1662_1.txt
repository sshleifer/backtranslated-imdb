This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your game movie look like a backup dog. Based on a book by Britney Spears and her mother, this is a bunch of garbage with a reasonable interpretation from Virginia Madsen (I hope you paid well) to save it. The story of a red dice red which earns a scholarship in a prestigious music school is a little, but a pedaling vehicle of Mrs. Spears music pants for the consumer and generally agree that the low forehead must be the way. Nothing good happens here with all the beats as predictable as the next day. Never again.
