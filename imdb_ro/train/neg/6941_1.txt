This movie is not just boring, but very badly done. The graphics are so bad that it is not even the second rate - they are terrible. Characters are not facial expressions, the voice acting is empty and soulless, and the plot is absolutely ... well ... everything and everything. My 5 year age likes - but she thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
