EXTREMITE <br /> <br /> Appearance Report: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman turns the tables on a rapist who might be when mounts and is forced to decide whether to kill or inform the police, in which case he might be released and attacked again. Exploitation fans who could expect another "hard" raccoon fantasy in FEMALE DAY STAGE (1978) will surely be disappointed with EXTREME. True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two long-awaited attacks before winning his upper hand over his attacker (James Russso), but screenwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes just before revealing the dilemma informs the moral core of of this production. Would their final solution be sustained in court? Perhaps ... Based on a stage play that left the wounded and shaken actors after each show, the film does not try to open the narrative and is instead based on a limited framework for the main action. Professional and technical credits are good, though Fawcett's poor performance will not effectively play the audience who could rely on it to provide a snap for indignant indignation.
