This is a kind of movie that leaves you with an impression. Writing Stories It's what the movie does. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects .. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect. Except. The story is only weak and so everything fails. Imagine if you have the power to be invisible ... What would you do? Well, the crazy scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) could think of nothing but the comfort and rape of women. That's all you could think of "genius." Is it trying to get extra power? Not. He does not even bother his research to return to being visible. The guy is practically a crazy maniac. Add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young boys. Throwing jokes like in a bar. If it was not for all white clothes and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of "Luck". Very superficial and poor personalities and very little care is to make you think these guys are just ladies for the Hollow Man wolf. Even as a thriller, the movie falls short, because most of the "thrills" are written so badly and are full of illogical behaviors of the actors just screaming "This is just a stupid thing to get it I make the naked man find me alone and kill me. " <br /> <br /> If you read the current book, while the scientist (Cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and an embarrassing thought that enters its character. In the film, Cane is just the sick guy who goes on a crowded market to rub his body against women and get down on it. Just sad.
