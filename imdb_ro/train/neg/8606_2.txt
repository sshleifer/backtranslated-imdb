I love the killer Insects movies that are really fun to watch, I had to see this movie as one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. I met him and I would like to listen to him that this movie was terrible like he was Said was, after saying that I was still dying to see how bad he was. Dad: People die on mysterious and frightening, and no one has a clue what is causing it. Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer bullets is laughing at the authorities. Only when the number of bodies begins to rise and a cock crow from England starts to snooping around begins to look like Mike had the right idea, after all. This movie as the most overacting you've ever seen a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and it seems they quickly transmit the scenes! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times more frightening, ten times gorilla and had a much more story for her! this movie at all! Because I am a great fan of Slugs's book and the second book called Soil Growth! Both books are wonderful <br /> <br /> Read the book, then watch the movie, you may want more than I did Give the 2 out of 10
