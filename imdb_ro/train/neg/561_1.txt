Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First, the plot is idiotic, it makes no sense. The script is full of deliberately funny dialogues. The audience laughed several times. And the suspense is very low. The actors play so, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also terrific moments spectacular. The saddest parts are when they try to be aggressively sexy and say things like "I want to hear you" and it seems, to say, easy, a very mature woman who acts rude and not sexy at all. The erotic tension in BI1 is totally gone. From a technical point of view, the Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre film - better than the typical DVD, but on a much lower leverage than the original movie. For example, the crazy scene is bad. Director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and he shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who do not fit Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The movie looks habitually and badly edited sometimes. I'm sorry, but my first thought, after I left the theater, was: "Why did not they make this movie earlier and with original talent behind the success of the first film?" All for all the original film is Citizen Kane compared to it. The first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break in popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. He had the best interpretation of Sharon Stone in his career. He had this particular style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentional funny, badly directed movie and a sure winner of Razzie in many categories. It's a shame they made this movie.
