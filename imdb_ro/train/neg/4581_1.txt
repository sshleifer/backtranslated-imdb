Pathetic attempt to use science to justify religion / philosophy of new age. The two have nothing to do with the others, and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is simply wrong. Examples? Quantum theory supports ideas from Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the subatomic world, you can not definitely predict a particle location at some point. You can only give your chances of being exactly in one place at a time. Also, the observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this, so far, is correct. But then he says that this means that if you would think with all the sincerity that you could pass through a wall, you could indeed do it. This is a complete poppycock. Instead, the theory affirms that at our level it is possible to go through a wall, but it is just a coincidence and has nothing to do with faith. You will also have to continue to go to the wall so that eternity ever has the greatest chance of going through the wall, the chances of being so astronomical against it. This is just an example of how they distort science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unfortunate photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. Almost half the image gets so confused that it's incomprehensible. Something with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be a truth for it, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. In addition, string theory is the new hot thing in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this game, we suggest you rent the Elegant Universe, a stunning series made for NOVA on PBS, which gives you a history of Newton physics and a seriousness for Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 long episodes . Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
