This anime series begins excellent: interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is immediately explained, a proverbial carrot spinning in front of the spectator, letting the spectator follow each episode that followed. But imagine your disappointment in discovering that the SF thriller / giant adventure robot is just a background for the psychological and quasi-religious exploitation of the priesthood. If you want to hear "You're OK, it's good to be you." after being shot with negative slogans and negative emotions of the characters, then this is for you. If you want to make a SF movie, which is simply fun, look at it. Both original and alternative caps were profoundly disappointing to me. All this, and this movie was too preaching.
