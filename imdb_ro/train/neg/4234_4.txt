Not the best-made movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty funny. The land is blades, but the killing is not too bad. I have to be honest, if you do not follow the troops that appear in this movie, you will not find this movie as fun as the ones that do. I know someone who has seen this movie and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was done in your spare time of being in the tournament between playing and drinking children with children behind the scenes . ... is not made to be taken seriously. It's an umbrella cheese for the best punk and over 100 killings, most of which are extremely goral, it's a fun movie to have friends to see, drink and be glad!
