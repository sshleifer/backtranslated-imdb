Since I loved the Cartoon Cartoon Inspector Gadget in the 80's, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the movie could not keep you interested for a long time. I was glad it was over. If you want to see the Gadget Inspector, watch the animated drawing. It was much better than the movie.
