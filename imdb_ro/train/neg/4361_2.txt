Using movie predators from the Dinosaur Planet, this video (except for stolen filming) refers to a bunch of people shot in space landing on a dinosaur planet, which is ... do not wait, it's really earth. A five minute sketch lasted for 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series) - having a nostalgic home movie feels coupled with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible slogan to go through. Have we allowed to think about the question of becoming so uncreated that we are now burying old films not only for plotting, but also for inappropriate filming? Clearly low budget producers are so desperate that they really will give us something to get our money
