This movie is horrible. Bad is acting, I write evil, bad music. It's horrible. Not only is it incredibly erroneous by role plays, but the key elements of the movie are poorly executed. May God, in whom I do not believe, have mercy on the souls of the miserable bastards who conceived and gave birth to this abomination.
