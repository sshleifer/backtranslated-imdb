First of all, this plot is a little overwhelmed - a girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, a snobby girl intervenes, all looks lost, girl crosses, everyone loves her again, etc. She throws up an attractive man crushing the heroine plus one-parent issues and is so predictable you can recite it with her. Secondly, I really do not like how it keeps the classical music discourse. They send the message that everyone involved in classical music is embarrassed, snobby and close - in fact, I do not remember the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the film, Holly says, "Why do I have to be so loud. ... so classic I really insult how she labels classical music this way Thirdly, I've gone over it a dozen times but the only reason I can think about making this movie is to promote Britney Spears, there is no point at all. And oh, while the actress who played Holly (I'm not sure if she was really singing or not) had a pretty good voice, not it was just as amazing as they did - especially when she was boning. It supports the whole good one.
