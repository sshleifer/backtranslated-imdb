And how she did it in production amazes me. The main character is an unpleasant show that is not a little strange. I can not resist the character. He's a stupid fool with nothing to offer to the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon on the surface in the last 10 years, no joke. The story lines are both written and executed badly. Jokes are just as bad as those on Disney's Sweet Life in Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title is even worse. It's like this show is written by a couple of 15-year-olds who have based their character on them, and I think they're hot things when they're really just arrogant and lacking creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go away and fast!
