The original Boogeyman was a stupid, but fun, supernatural movie. It was not a wonderful movie at all, but fun in the right mind. The third installment of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless shooting. Second, recycled bit LOADS from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateur, but not in an incredibly inept way, simply incredibly boring. This material was clearly beaten quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a snap device for the endless clips of the first movies (and possibly second). And boys, I give the milk those clips from the previous films; sometimes re-using the sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice on what uselessly describes exactly what we see with our eyes. The whole experience of following this is really mind-boggling. Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst kind of exploitation; the genre that exploits the audience in a very cynical way. I want to keep this short review so far, because this movie does not deserve much. There is nothing here worthless. This is of no value.
