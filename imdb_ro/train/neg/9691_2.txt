This is a superficial hedonism and / or a social comment wrapped in a tragic story about a scheming of a jealous young woman to remove her father and fianc√©e. Is incest or just a sight through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All the characters except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are empty and vague. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys with breasts" comment of a previous review). The land was walking. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes of film, which unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see great dresses and jewels on the Riviera, we recommend "Grab a Thief" - where you get the bonuses added by a fun story and love characters. <br /> <br /> I like to film to have fun. Personally, I really do not care where a movie is set up. Regardless of time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some nice characters. It does not hurt me if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr offers an ordinary performance, just like David Niven in a perfect role. The "2" rating is exclusive to Kerr and Niven, and for cinema - colorful rich and thin scenes, preconceived by black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great cinemas in the world can not save a poor story with unusual characters. The ear of a sow is still the sow's ear. Consequently, following this mess was a serious loss of my time.
