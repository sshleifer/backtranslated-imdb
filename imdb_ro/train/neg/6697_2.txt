Crazy Shotgun toting-incest convicted-revenge seeking truck drivers and obsessive-control disorder "Dad raped me when I was 12" wearing shirts, all latex worn prostitutes is just some of the character that you will be introduced into this complete shame of a film that can be easily viewed on any cable television station (IE: Skinemax) at 4am on Sunday night. (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but it was a long story for a useless short film). Filmed in "somewhere" Canada, with almost no budget, the intrigue for this strange show is met, the police in her, obviously, never heard of "State Jurisdiction", because they eventually banish both Miya Hookers) as well as Trent (idiot, Anal Retentive, Generic, USA, and I thought only the FBI could do that.) The camera is unpleasant, sexual scenes are mediocre, and the act is so bad that it could actually cause , unintentional acid flashbacks on movies such as "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6." As far as Skin du te scenes (which is the only reason to rent this movie, you do not even want to buy it) they are two of them.The first one is the only one worth watching, although it is the Dominatrix Sex scenario with Kari Salin and ____ (you enter an unknown actor here, obviously did nothing else to do) in a mummering, disgusting room broken which droplets and car the soda from the outside, which has only blue tonic water). It's all S & M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax and licked underwear) and eventually he's left in a motel room without money and policemen waiting at the door I show you, let a prostitute put you in a motel room in the "middle of nowhere"). Unfortunately, however, Kari does not show any skin worth reminiscing, and this alone can cause profound traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so it is certainly a downer to this film. As for the end, Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would not mind if I showed it to you, but you will not spend your hard earned money for that one. Everything gives me 1/5 for action, 3/5 for skin (see last paragraph) and 0/0 for action, character development or complicated plotting. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
