As a premise, this version of backwoods told Dead Calm promised. However, Eric Red's inability to make a convincing hurricane leads to a wave of continuity and illumination errors. Ultimately, the spectator is more scared by the bizarre weather effects than the intentional story. Indeed, the intermittent over-straightening of the ham-fisted are also distracting. Charles Dance, making a hardback inedited hardass, does his best to save the film. But, eventually, Undertow grumbles like a pig ... and has more ham at the boot.
