Good! What can be said? First, this adaptation is too long at 4 hours for the complexity (or lack of) of the plot. Actors are very trying to do something out of this movie, but there is not much content for the time available. Swayzee is not at all a Quatermain character. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in the "Extraordinary League of Gentlemen," Swayzee does not really make the class. This Winchester repeat rifle does not have the strength, stature, subtlety or humor necessary for that party and is supported by everyone, including the witch doctor who, unfortunately, seems more convincing than an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the visions are nice, but there are silly mistakes in cinema. E.g. When the happy team reaches the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible to the oasis, waiting for them to go into them. The climbing of the mine leads to an exit (the next blow), just like the exit seen from the passage that they have climbed and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any time. In some ways I want to have it. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who watch Quatermain is a stereotypical character who shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is doing pretty well as a sad father, returning to London, unable to obtain custody of his son. Swayzee should stay with that. He is not able to take part of a courageous gentleman with a strong heart, a life experience and a sense of fair play. 4 out of 10. Barely
