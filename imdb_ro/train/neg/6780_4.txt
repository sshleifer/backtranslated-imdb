This film was a critically acclaimed and box-office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a play - which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some naval officers on vacation in San Francisco during the Second World War. They have 4 days of vacation that I spend at Mark Hopkins Hotel. The film moves very much and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a kind of dealer and he does not really shoot him. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially ready to play alongside Grant, but she also had other commitments - so Suzy Parker came in. She has never done it before, but it was America's top photographic model at the time. I think he did a good job, considering all the pressure he had. Grant's juggling with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - did not work. Studio tried to give him a certain class acting with Grant - but the character had no substance.
