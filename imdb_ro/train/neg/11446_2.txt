My family and I examined the Underdog last night. And as bad as Underdog (my four-year-old lover), Hot Rod seems to be an Oscar-worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie was whether Evel himself had retired to push Samberg in front for making the movie. I will admit, however, that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with most of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If it was you, I would make a pass. And stay home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you're dead to look at this, people who are under the influence might enjoy it.
