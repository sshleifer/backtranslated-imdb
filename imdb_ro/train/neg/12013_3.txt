I should have thought any movie with Mrs. Poltergeist would not be good. In fact, it starts well, but during the first crime scenes you will find that the movie you are watching is a film inside a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching that movie. An audience girl is so annoying that I would have turned around and strangled him. A little weird, but far from good.
