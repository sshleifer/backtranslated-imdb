A group of friends meet face-to-face with a hideous cannibal family while camping in the beautiful countryside of Germany. The "cannibal mutant" family concept is almost as old as the hills inbred brains often call home, so any director who tries to breathe new life into the genre must come up with something quite special to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give a well-tired routine a teutonic cross, transplanting action in the Black Forest and offering him a low-budget German treatment. The result is a very bloody but totally non-original effort that becomes almost indescribable due to horrifying directorships, especially the non-stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. If Timo Rose did not opt ​​to use all the editing software he offered, then the Barricade could have been a fun gore-fest reasonably: his inexperienced distribution is reasonable; Bloody effects are properly churning the stomach; and there are one or two scarecrows and even some creepy, well-designed moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the terrible work of the camera, noise-editing, and an overwhelming glimmer of visual gimmick, used to give the film a distorted look that is so inexplicable to today's filmmakers. /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 simply for unusual gore, which includes a wonderful scene in which a guy is forced to drink acid, a lot of unpleasant injuries caused by a variety of sharp tools and some pretty decent damage to rifle.
