What is a snoring-fest? Of all the fragments of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remember and update, it is by far one of the most unnecessary. This was a completely useless show in the first place, and we do not need a "modern" update. It does not matter the fanaticism and sexism inherent to the system from the beginning, so much progress has been made from a social point of view, since the show claimed that the whole point of the show (if ever) was lost. Also, what is the point of having a character called Boss Hogg if he does NOT overweight?
