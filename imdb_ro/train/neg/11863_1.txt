I thought these movies were an escape, I expected to be much better than it was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie and I did not stay in a movie theater for this movie. Where to start with this movie, the action in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and only the general story of this movie was not special. I thought this movie should be great, but it was just a waste of raw time. I think the action in this movie was terrible, no actor in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if I had a different role than Kirk actor than Jay Baruchel, it might have been better, but all the time I looked at this film showed tall and I did not feel she was not acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there's no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie did not have names and had very little influence in this film. The humor of this movie was not funny at all, there were a few lining in the film, but nothing to say to your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith was having a hard time, because he could not decide if he wanted a love story or a comedy. I honestly believe he has to stay with the Burger King commercials. I think this movie might have been better if the writers had gone to a different director. The story of this movie is just like any other hot little girl just OK love story boring type I think it would have been better if it were more original, but what avoids anything. Sincerity would not recommend anyone to see this movie. I think you'd have more fun with the dentist than this movie. Save your agony and you do not see it.
