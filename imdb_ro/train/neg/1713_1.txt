If you did not see Zombie, you did not. A contest, such as "making your own horror film in a single day," could only come in with an insult to insult the spectators' intelligence. Mister. Sheets has forgotten a story, a plot, a fair dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents, and the credited lighting designer forgot to appear. Looks like it was recorded on camera cameras and copied on the equipment even worse. The makeup effect consists of black mascara for zombies and yogurt that pours over people's heads to simulate melting of the skin. This is nothing but a home movie and a very bad one. Just fun to watch friends, family members and neighbors who were willing to appear for filming. I can not understand why this headache in a product is listed in CERTAIN film magazines or on serious sites - I have home movies with wedding parties that are much better and more exciting. A total waste of time, money and energy. Continuing ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same garbage.
