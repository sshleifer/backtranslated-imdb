This movie, originally released at Christmas, 1940, has long been lost. A very bad copy came back and turned into a CD, now for sale. Do not buy it! The film is inexplicably terrible. Casting is poor, the script is terrible, and direction is terrible. Picture Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the climax. Perhaps this movie was deliberately lost.
