Funny how a studio thinks it can do a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with a completely new cast and is expected to float. Of course they used different actors for Batman, but in this case, Batman was a classic character before any of the actor to dress his head. In this case, you had a classic character in goggles with a cornice, wearing Ralphy who wanted a Christmas red Christmas ... Somehow we should look and accept another boy who has no resemblance to original. If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have guessed it from the show ... except that Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that he constantly remembers that the original was much better. . Ultimately it might work if they threw the movie better. He would have to look for a similar look or simply ignore the original and not try to copy his look and feel. This is just a cheap imitation. The Ralph does not evoke any sympathy, but only the desire to seem that his character pulls his eye out or dies.
