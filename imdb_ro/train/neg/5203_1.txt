I've seen poor movies in my own time, but that's what I do! Why Why Was This Movie Made? There's nothing here. Please put your trust in me, remove the switch and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a plot ... that could take about 5 minutes to be displayed on the camera. This is the key issue, the story "based on a true story" (mmm ... anything) does not scatter in 80 minutes. And so you have to stay over an hour of watching the people walking around. That is it! In the first half an hour nothing happens, except to look at someone to go to a store ... and then three boys going through a forest. This time could have been spent on character development ... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we can not care less! In fact, I was finally for you baddie, so the movie will end! Besides, working with the camera is really horrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West is garbage. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his work is pants! These boring ones are coming nearer and then the only long one takes the others as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so dull that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was brought to guide the next film of cabin fever is beyond me! To finish, the act is also terrible, ... that goes for the film as a whole. Keep your health, hold on to this heap of total excrement!
