CAT OVERVIEW CATEGORIES (Il Gatto a New Code) Appearance rate: 2.35: 1 (Chromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (A Release Diary of 35mm and 70mm) An ex-journalist blind (Karl Malden) hears a blackmail plot outside of a genetic research lab and later equips with a reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of killing at the lab, involuntarily placing to their own lovers at the mercy of a psychopath killer. In 1969, Dario Argento created THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a thriller giallo in the same direction as his predecessor, who brought the famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and raised Franciscus (VALEA GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting movie - which the commercials claimed was "nine times more suspenseful" than "Bird" - is a disappointing, impeccably photographed, executed style, but too generous and without purpose for general consumption. /> Malden and Francisc are fully watched in good roles, and Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) is using the large chromoscopic frame to convey the hi-tech world where the Argento dark-screen scenario unfolds, but the Starlet Euro sub platform Catherine Spaak (LIBERTINE), as Franciscus's romantic interest, amounts to little more than useless stuffing. Important moments include an unforgettable encounter with the black-glove assassin in a crowded railway station (the edition is provided by Franco Fraticelli) and a night episode in which Malden and Franciscus are looking for an important clue in a grave tomb and the fall of the giant machinations of the killer. But in spite of these glitter shine, the movie moves from scenery to pointlessly, easily, without ever coming to boil. It is no surprise that Cat did not manage to mimic the runaway success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. (English version)
