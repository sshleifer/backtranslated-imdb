Greenaway's films are smart, erudite, and innovative. Nevertheless, style and grammar provoke and remind film viewers during the Second World War: the composition of the cadres, the use of the film, the static camera. It might be good to rub the table movies with this style, but it's not new. Perhaps the other "innovator", TS Eliot, draws more of the past than looking before an authentic innovator could or could. But Greenaway's greatest lack is that he can not write. His dialogue and even the structure of the plot are mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. If this weakness is most obvious is in his humor, which is poised and logical so that the joke is dead before being delivered. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it failed: ask a comedian stand-up to justify his act if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud about humor. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated her actors over the years to work as clones. I'm talking about the lines with a tedious air, whatever the narcissistic adolescents. This film, despite design and lighting, is simply simple.
