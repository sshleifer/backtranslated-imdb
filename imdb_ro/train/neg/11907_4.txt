I understand that the character Diehl is a small microcosm of America itself - seeing the Arab terrorists under each rock, only to finally find out that his own actions have led him to that state of siege and indeed if he practices the good will of all men, everything will be rainbow and marsh. Sorry for making stunning movies in the past that are neutral in politics and for good reason, the polemic is your weak point and they weaken this well-made film, amazingly filmed with absurd characters, dialogue and plot. More luck to the next move. Another thing that got me cranked was the point of view of the Los Angeles homeless section, being there for hunger reasons, these people do not get to eat. Truly, these people do not eat royal, but the real hunger of these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self worth, dignity you can not give a man. Yes, those people are hungry and, if they need it, they are available. Less the hunger of America, I would say it is more of the center of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering, and economic devastation. It is experiencing hunger, though a noble effort is to help a deeper systemic band and a human problem of homeless people. Bill Diehl was good and Michelle Williams was cute like the old old man.
