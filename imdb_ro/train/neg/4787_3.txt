This entry is certainly interesting for fans of the series (like me), but it is still largely incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, like the continuity of continuity. Some striking effects to be sure, but we will never know what it really means. Try to see the "NC-17" working version containing the gore that was cut to be re-rated "R".
