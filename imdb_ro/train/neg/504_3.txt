A copy particularly dishonest cinema cult Italian title with a nonsense to boot (if different alternate MARK Satan is even less relevant to the plot!) This hybrid of gothic horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica ) invented a kind of flat atmosphere? in fact, matched with manipulation, which is even dreadful! Here we arrive on an island (which has been invited by a count since he became crushed by a leading lady, a dead monk for his missing husband). The characters are quite stereotypes: the hero of middle age, but cute (played by Giacomo Rossi Stuart and whose family history carries more than its share of tragedy violent), the heroine of dignity, Comrade slut (recalling Mae West and defending the annoying of a manager scene gentle but devoted (forever led by one and all for his behavior boundless!), some lesbian, a gardener mysterious (ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who suddenly come into action if they know what I mean), a jealous maid (although nominated Femi Benussi, for what it's worth, is really a piece of whole), a religious fanatic of a butler, a maid impressive etc. means undiscovered, doubling atroceascÄƒ, snails pace , the unstoppable production (with scenes illustrating the high angry sea from a black and white film!), and the fact that the killing takes place only half an hour does not help In fact, Marcello Giombini's score, although pleasant in itself, seems to be incongruent with modernity in circumstances; who said the revelation turned out to be surprisingly elaborate (given that there is certainly no lack of suspects here).
