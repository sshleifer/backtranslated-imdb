As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse books, I think this series is a complete representation of them. Vampir Bill does not look too good and looks much older than he described in the book. I found that they had made some wonderful colorful characters, seem very cursive and vulgar. One of the things I've loved in books is that despite all the stupidity she's going through Sookie, she's always a lady, but she still does not seem like that in the TV series. Not only do prejudices presented in TV series are not as common in books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected them to be used for the evening.
