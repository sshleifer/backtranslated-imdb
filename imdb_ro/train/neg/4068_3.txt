With a title like this, it's above what I understood how this movie did not appeal to me. Some delicate moments and a gore were given, but the way the film was filmed and the general story gave me an idiotic and lazy attempt at huge "shock" tactics ... The inconsistent plot begins with a guy who raped and killed a woman locked at the bottom of the road. He and his abstaining brother are imprisoned until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend in the woods. She ends up forcing her into a home where she screws and later shows her a collection of boys kidnapped in the basement. Strongly drugged captives consist of their old boyfriend who violated her, a "hurried neighbor" and her abrasive boss. He explains he will kill everyone. She kills her murder and then turns her attention to the men (or pigs) she tortures and kills herself ... Most violence and humiliation have to do with food and genital destruction - all this is far from disturbances and essentially light. The best scene is a masturbation of the handle with graphic handles, followed by a painful male viola ... Surely, "I spit on your body, IP! Ss on your grave" was intended as an unofficial continuation of "I Spit on Your Grave "based mainly on the title and reference given by the main character - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally think it is a wild blasphemous statement! This movie is a dull, amateurish misery that strives to shock but has not failed ...
