This was a very short episode that appeared in one of 1971's Night Gallery. The episode starred Sue Lyon (from Lolita) and Joseph Campanella, who plays a child and a vampire. The vampire hires a child to follow his child (who seems to be a kind of werewolf or monster) as he goes to sleep for blood. The baby does not realize the appearance of the vampires when he sees it for the first time and begins to put two and two together when he notices that he has no mirror-reflection, has a strange collection of books in the occult library and hears strange noises in time what the vampire goes to talk to with the baby. He realizes that the man who hired her can not be what he originally thought. She pulls out the door, the vampire stands out and the episode ends. I do not know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted only 5 minutes. He would just have to extend his previous episode with the same 5 minutes and handle it. A total effort lost.
