The Underground Comedy movie is probably the worst train failure I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this film, and my friend no doubt accepted to look at him again, considering it was so terrible, but he had to prove how terrible he was. I like the color comedy. I thought at least that it would be so and we would be entertained. No, the act was so terrible, the "jokes" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was not where to find it. Maybe it should not have been a plot, so I can not stand this against this movie. It's pretty sad if the funniest thing in a comedy is an old man who has his head hit by a baton ..... by Batman ... A man dressed in a baseball uniform that acts with a bat . Hilarious. Simply genius. I have the feeling that I'm looking at this movie that the creators did and they hysterically laughed with their friends about it. Maybe this was full of jokes from inside that I just did not understand. Or perhaps it is the worst piece of garbage ever produced and should be enclosed in a vault and thrown into the Arctic Ocean. Do not buy this movie!
