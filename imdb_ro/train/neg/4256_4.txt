Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in the story and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee is good as a vampire hunter who is looking for himself (if you remember him, he was from Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny as Luke, the child who helps the woman she's loves it steals away from Dracula's body on the flat. Diane Neal It is good that the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying lover, and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Delivering better performance than Gerard Butler, he made the countdown in the original movie. Roy Scheider finished the rest of the show in this film and made a decent job as a mentor to Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they are gone from a good start. It's in the air if the last movie will close the series on a good note.
