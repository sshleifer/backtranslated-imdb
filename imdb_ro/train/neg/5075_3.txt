The animation was good, the image was good, although it was not completely original, however, the story was too long, it was too confusing and over the top dramatics. After about an hour, I could not wait to finish. With so many characters who have nothing to contribute and plot items that come either from nowhere or do not go anywhere this movie really was not a movie at all and it would have been better than a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this type of typical story, you may like it, but honestly, I was spoiled by more creative stories that actually have a kind of message to say. Go rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you'll get a lot more out of it.
