This relic of a short film begins with an adolescent going through the process of trying to get a driving license. It gets quickly weakened with almost any topic that can be imagined about cars. Things are discussed like dune buggy, love races, custom dyed work and car shows. It is often attempted to be humorous, but the film is in the meantime boring, detached, and even sometimes sexual. None of the people in the movie is heard. Instead, everything is done in narrative and voice. Sorry, but I can not resist. There is nothing educational or interesting about "Father, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of mindless stuffing to get the time out on their show "Wonderful World Of Disney". 1/10
