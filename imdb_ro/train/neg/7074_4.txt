My God, this movie is terribly boring. I'm a great fan of Gina Gershon, when I was renting this movie, I was expecting a romantic drama and a great performance from Gershon. Gershon is great as always, but she is not an actress suitable for this role, it's too good for Serbedzija. The romance between the characters of Gershon and Serbedzija is too unconvincing. And I forgot the character of Serbedzija (a winning organizer), he is not charming in anyway in the movie. How was Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) beyond my understanding. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job on this role, but they do not have the European idea. In any case, I was so bored in the movie. If you are looking for a good movie Gina Gershon, check out Bound, the best movie so far. If you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man, try some of Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies. Gina Gershon is so undervalued, and deserves more chances than that, wanting her to make a better choice in the future.
