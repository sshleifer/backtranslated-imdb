I can not believe I lost five hours of my life on this garbage. The previous five days offer by this author was extremely enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones has been the main culprit since he mumbled or beat her lines, but most of the rest of the camp followed her example. Exceptional exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers listen to productions before they are running to make sure the dialogue is audible? Consequently, I think I lost a look at what was happening, and since the initial plot seemed to turn into the standard between them and the Muslims, the rest lost my interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. A complete dock.
