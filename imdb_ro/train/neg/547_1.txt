The full title of this film is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that no one can win, but you can certainly reduce your margin of loss by not losing any of your precious "spells" on this junk. This movie was crowded and manipulating in a way that made K3G look honest. It has spread my credulity too much. She was ridiculously stupid in her story and deserves to be scorned for it. It's not as awful as Baghban or Black, but this movie has nothing to recommend. Stupid, useless, with ridiculous OTT performance by Amitji. Central "plot" is another ugly example of cruel manipulative propaganda that infects so many BW family films. If my father, who grew up and loved me, treated me like Big B, I shot Akshay. Let's not say anything about trivialisation of terminal disease.
