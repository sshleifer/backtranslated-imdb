My way was while watching this ... but it seems that this is the reason for family madness in this movie. That does not make much sense, anyway, as others have said, it was one of Karloff's last films and only presence on the screen gives it credibility. It is sad that all the great legends of horror films of the sound age were eventually reduced with a low-grade garbage. Marginally, Boris went down slightly better than Bela Lugosi, but not too much. <br /> <br /> Boris does everything he can and gives credit for trying to keep the mess together. Strident background music does not help and distracts attention from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican song is called in a strange monotone, cut in English, which recalls the type used in porn videos of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I think Edgar Allen Poe's "Usher House" is taken from him, but it would be hard to appreciate much of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> However, there are much better movies there with Boris Karloff at the best moments, look for them out and give them a wide place if you do not want the curse of the "falling brain"!
