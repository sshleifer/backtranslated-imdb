How can Barry Levinson collect comic strip comedies Ben Stiller and Jack Black, superstar Rachel Weisz, old pro Christopher Walken, and still deliver such a smell without humor? Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invented a spray to make the dirt of the dogs disappear and become a multi-millionaire consuming consumer. The premise is thin, but fairly sound in the right hands to have been a launch ramp for a great bitching between the two stars, but everyone involved overwhelms each hand, every chance I can. Stiller and Black are not just funny for too long, Weisz seems sensational as always, but he's a little used in a criminal way, and except for Walken as a stick that urges Stiller's character to take revenge is a turgid trudge to the end of this tense phrase.
