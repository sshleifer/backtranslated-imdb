How sad it is not the option of posting a note smaller than 1. I looked at this nonsense and could hardly believe what I was watching. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, action, direction, story, everything, just everything. Actually, I woke up loudly at different points in the movie. I loved the very little that our hero is going through the hospital with the slow motion slowing down and clipping the clipboard from the nurses' hand because ............. well. Just because. Product placement? Crucifix (crosses) Everywhere. If you are Christian and very pleased, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really have to go out more.
