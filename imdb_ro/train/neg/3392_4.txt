What about Indonesian musical films? I have never seen Indonesian musical films such as those made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of "what they call" poetic lines. This story of the love of two children who are separated and then meet again after a few years of change has no special remarks. It's a simple story plot (but it's pretty focused though though) with "intended to be" musical story lines here and there. <br /> <br /> The confusing characters that should be saved by shining action are neglected. The main actor can try to live the character, but it's the best thing he could do trying. As for pouring, I do not feel the need to put a Balinese student in that story and, of course, they are not the only unnecessary characters. The weird thing is: why would I want to see this movie? Perhaps because of mangoes ...
