This is the case for a group of people who think they are so smart they have a story that fits with time. Remember all the political conspiracies that had been caught in the room in the years that led to Watergate and a little later? Most movies trying to make money on televisions made for television, so powerful, so distraught conspiracies have been caught in their athmosphere attitude. The conversation they find is as dated as others conspire stints of time, but Coppola was true for its main character and Hackman was an actor quite committed to respecting. I mean, these conspiracy films are softened mostly by the characters of the noir heroes. A lot of unanswered questions, a lot of discomfort ... Well, it assumes at least Bergman to build a movie about such non-visual bases. The next man is a perfect example of his time: one political soup served with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy by strangling the web around him. No part is interesting in itself and the whole is no better. In fact, you can tell how much it will be bad from the first sequences that sharpen this "shadow" without ever advancing the story. Pedestrian direction at worst, like most of the movie, is a pompous accumulation of scenes that rotate around naive violence brought under the eyes of the viewer.
