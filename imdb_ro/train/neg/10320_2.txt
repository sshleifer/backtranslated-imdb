We really hope it would be a fun show, considering all hype clips and smart preview clips. And I'm talking about hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the BBC World Today show - a show that is broadcast all over the world. Unfortunately, this show does not even come close to delivering. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds so funny for the first time you hear them, but then they look blades - and they are not treated or overturned. All characters are one-dimensional. The actor is - well - mediocre (I'm nice). It is the classic CBC recipe - one that does not always work. If you are a Muslim, I think you should have been stupid to think of any of the white characters and if you are white, be offended by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed either as "bigoted" or ignorant, or both. Not that the fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies have their roots. It's just a problem when it's not fun - as in this show. Canada bursts with amusing people - so many we export to Hollywood regularly. So how did the producers of this show find nothing?
