The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many defects in plotting took so much of the film that they almost made him undiscovered. The basics, such as character development, were considered at best. The inconsistencies have also increased his ugly heads. A massive mansion in the middle of the Irish rural countryside? Characters just "pointing" in the gardens during a thunderous night (at very convenient times, could I add)? Generally, it was not "bad". I rated her 4, relying on Alison Elliott's story and talent.
