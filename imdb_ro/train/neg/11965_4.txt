Being a puppy of history who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Granted, the costumes and scenarios were quite authentic, but the Hollywood portrait of this "Little Little British Horn" was really boring. The number of films dedicated to the march or parade must have been unprecedented in the history of the film. Eveytime I heard the beginning of triumphal background music, I knew I had to prepare myself for another laborious, meaningless filling scene. Obviously, the manufacturers have invested heavily in "stationary" and were determined to get the value of their money. Despite the remarkable distribution, their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would be disappointed. Their lines were so weak and meaningless that I could not believe they were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and Alcatraz's Bird Man. not much better.
