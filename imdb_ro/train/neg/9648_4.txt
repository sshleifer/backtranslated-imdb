Vip Shah has done an impressive work as a director in the past. "Waqt - Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were fun and exciting to watch. "Singh Is Kinng" was fun, it produced. His last exit as director of "London Dreams" comes as his worst career. London Dreams has a mediocre story, it's about how success transforms friendship into hatred. Agree, it has the potential, but when you look at "London Dreams" you wonder what's going on? This movie has perhaps the worst culmination of recent years. Vip Shah, the writer, puts Vipul Shah director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can someone forgive a person who has decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and apologize to his diaper girlfriend for his uncle Om Puri. When he arrives in India rather than trick him or abuse him, Salman meets with the baja band and says he was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vim Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If so, then you have failed completely. The only question I want to address to Vipul Shah is that you will greet a person who destroyed you with such a large reception? Write down what you feel, do not fool our audience, we are sensitive enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is terrible. No song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is superb though. He's wearing the film on his shoulders and he's doing really well in emotional scenes. But again, its character is shown as a GOD, which makes it look like a delay in the end. Ajay is just as good, but Salman completely shielded him. Asin is wasted and who is a great talent like Om Puri in this movie? Rannvijay hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is okay like a vamp. <br /> <br /> On the whole, this dream remains a dream!
