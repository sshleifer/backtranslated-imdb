On the part of director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class and I recognized the main actress, so I tried it despite the critics' rating. In fact, Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's team of Michael Pitt) have murdered a random girl to convince and to do without the police finding them. Investigating the crime is Detective Cassie "The Hyena" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with the new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite confused by the evidence found on the scene, unrelated hair. The plan does not seem to work well, because Cassie and Sam do pretty quick on Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a matter of eliminating them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. YES. Al Swanson. Now I see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the killing for a provocative thing, but this movie does it in a very stupid way and not even a reasonable Bullock can save it from being boring and predictable. Suitable!
