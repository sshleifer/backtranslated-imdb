Del - "You are the worst intelligent man I've ever met." Calvin - "Well, I had a brain but lost it in re-writing." I think what seems to me the worst about this bastarding of Asimov's work was how portrayed Susan Calvin's character. In books, she was in fact one of the strongest female protagonists capable of thinking about her through a problem. Here is just a distressed little girl waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. There are transient references to Robinson's laws in Asimov, but they are a subsequent thought of the CGI action and action scene. <br /> <br /> Smith is pleasing, as it is in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not that good. YOu give away long before these genius characters do.
