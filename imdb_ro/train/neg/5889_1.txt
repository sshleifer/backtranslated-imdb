First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are continually improving. From the boring emotional movies of the '70s and' 80s, the movies in this place began to contain some humor. Imagine .. The real comedies were made! Movies actually start to become fun and fun, unlike long, dark, depressing and boring. In the 90's and 00's, some very wonderful films were made by a "new generation" of filmmakers. The film after the film was praised by critics and played a lot of money. It has become a norm! <br /> <br /> Then United came ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not funny. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We're thinking funny. Because we are accustomed to the Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with a distribution like this with some really funny comedians. But ... They do not say or do anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me the humor! Is this strange clerk playing Harald Eia? Is the football coach absolutely totally unrealistic? Are Arne Scheie's comments? The movie is not even funny! But that's not my main talk about United. This is predictability. (And here I am afraid that the Norwegian comedies have stopped since I have seen this in many other movies too). You know all the time that it will end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the movie and everyone gets exactly what they deserve in the end. There is absolutely no place for surprises at all! In all I can say I was feeling bad after watching this movie. It was the only film that made me realize we probably need new blood in the Norwegian movie ... again!
