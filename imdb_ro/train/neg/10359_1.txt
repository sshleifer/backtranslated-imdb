The Wrinkle in Time series is my favorite childhood series. I have read and reread them several times than I can count in the last 35+ years. Characters, with all their virtues and defects, are close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual story they love so much. Telling me that I was disappointed with this movie would be a great understatement. If you have never read the book (books), I imagine you will enjoy the film. The action is acceptable, the special effects are well done for a movie made for television, and the story is interesting. However, if you like books, avoid this movie at any price. I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the film," I was expecting it to be bad and it is. "" Like another reviewer here, I feel the need to read the book again to scatter this movie out of my mind.
