A Z-grade horror director, Carl Monson, was one of the most prolific executives operating in the low-budget sphere. His films are full of unsightly gore, laughing actors, boring underground and painful dialogue. the figure is killing wildly the guests staying at the family mansion. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. You do not actually see the killing except the shadows and a few splashes of blood. The rhythm is lethargic, and the plot is rather uninteresting. but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Just be careful: do not mistake Monson's movie with Andy Milligan's "inherited blood" just as poor.
