Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This Italian infamous is the most famous for "Zombie," and absolutely unrecognizable "The Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add it to the undetermined list <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, refers to a nekkid woman wearing a gold mask and a string G. She wants the strength of a young man called a stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magical because they shine. Arrow boys join a guy in a bad wig, and they spend most of the rescue film each other from flat action sequences. Eventually, the nekkid chicken is defeated, but not before taking the mask off and recalling why I broke up with my high school girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Fulci falls in every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with smoke. Nothing is like a smoky orange action sequence that will make you delight in Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are ridiculous. In a sequence, our ambiguous gay duo is attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously scratches of pine on the film itself. Most of the budget of effects must have been spent on the Fully-licious gore, which consists entirely of injuries to the wounds. Hey, we can use a good wound with a whole wound while, but when you get into a wound, it's boring. I had to play with the brightness setting on my TV anyway just to see what the hell was going on. There is a lot of discussion about the fulfillment of omens and prophecies, so let me take a look in the future ... if you find this movie and you follow it, you will regret it. The scene in the video (Media) does not appear in the movie in any context. "Conquest" is a con. <br /> <br /> What MST3K could have done with this! This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gore, female nudity, short male nudity and light sexual content. <br /> <br />
