This movie was so amateur that I could not believe what I was seeing. It's filmed on VIDEO! Do not shoot! I have not seen such a thing since the early 1970s, when the late night networks showed the video of the movie "horror shot" of the video ...... video. She looks like a bad soap opera, and that's a compliment. Some actors give her the best shot. Michael Des Barres is doing well with what he is given to do, who must behave as a sex-addicted addict. I can not say it's nice to look. Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very few variations in camera angles. I can not blame her for someone else's deadlock, but she's absolutely unbelievable in her role. Her daughter's voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she is out of range with her. Alexandra Paul is pitifully defeated. Every line he offers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to shout at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a bad treat? Eventually, Rosanna Arquette as a sweet, rogue wife breaks out well and probably the most credible of the bunch. But that does not mean too much. This must be the worst movie I have seen over the years.
