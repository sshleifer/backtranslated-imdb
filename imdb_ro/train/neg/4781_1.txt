This could be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever made. Writers and producers should study German films from the thirties and forties. He knew how to sell. Even the Soviet-style leader, like a father, was better done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, regained in the church in the last second at a time, for Father to be "saved" by Hoover / God was not too bad. Unfortunately, they seemed to have rushed and were not quite melodramatic. A couple of heavenly blows of the angelic Hoover in the corner of the screen - shining and nodding - would add a lot. The best thing is that Hoover only saves the family and the deserving children who have "proven" their worth. Unfortunately, other homeless people were portrayed as pleasant and even good - but God Hoover does not help. A better approach would have been sparkling spirits to show the justice of their state. Finally, bright and cheerful recovery scenes (after Hoover saved the country from the depression) should have rolled over at the end. We could then see how the Hoover-God had not only saved this meritorious family, but all the merits truly worthwhile. Amateurs at best.
