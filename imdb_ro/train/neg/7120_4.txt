I saw the first movie on MST3K. And, although I laughed at my posse for jokes, I do not think this movie was so bad. Sure it was a bit difficult to understand that a low budget was quite obvious, but it had a plot very similar to Hitchcock and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MST3K version, I was really amused. This movie is crying for a remake from Hollywood.
