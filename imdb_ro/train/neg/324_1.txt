The worst mistake in my life. I chose this movie at Target for $ 5 because I thought it was "Sandler, I can make some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three friends fell asleep and still suffered. The worst scenario, the worst scenario, the worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to touch my head for an hour, then I'd stop and you know why? Because he felt good. After I hit my head, I stuck that movie in the microwave and I saw it burned ... and that felt better than anything else I ever did. It took the American Psycho, the Dark Army and Kill Bill just to get over that bullshit. I hate SANDLER FOR PRESENT PRACTICAL PRESS AND HUNTING A MY LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
