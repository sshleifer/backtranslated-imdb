From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clich√©s that your typical NRA member will not really like this movie. I give him 2 out of 10, only because of William Benton's act. I can not believe they voted 6+ people for this movie. It is so biased towards "a certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born evil. They are not born well. They are born with a clean slate. It is society, parents and education what makes them. And if they make a wrong turn, somewhere on the line, it certainly will not be the American criminal system that will resume it on the right track! However, avoid this movie like plague. I bet you have more to do with your time than to lose this piece of nonsense
