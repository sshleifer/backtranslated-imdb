One of the most boring slashers ever. If that can be said. I would not have watched if it came to a porn movie that resembled altogether. Watching a small group of middle-aged men in the woods is really unbearable. Have they made such films for adolescents who were really target when they did this festive sleep? My favorite part of this movie is the cover and it's the only reason I chose to look for this movie that was part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after seeing the other films in this 50 pack I'll give you realize it is not anywhere else. So, if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, we recommend right before Dawn and Final Terror.
