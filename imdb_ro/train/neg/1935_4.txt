Chinese Ghost Story III is an absolutely useless sequel to two fantastic fantastic movies. The film offers special effects that can be expected but does not get painful on all other fronts. The actors play extremely stupid cartoons. You must still be in diapers to find your harassment humor even distant fun. Plot is foreseeable and development is sometimes irregular and often slow. Towards the end, the film begins to resemble the old Godzilla films, including special effects of size greater than life and a ghost (well, once again) with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have smiled if I was expecting camp. It's amazing to see what fans of garbage fantasy must be subjected to - in this case, because someone thought they could squeeze some extra money out of a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.
