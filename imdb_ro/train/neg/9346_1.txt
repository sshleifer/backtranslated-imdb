This movie was a yawn from credits to credits, it's boring to the point of tediousness, and the acting is made of wood and clogged! Of course, it was director Richard Jobson who directed his debut, but who, on earth, lit up a scenario as poorly developed as this one? It looks like other money in the drain government project (the Scottish screen is surprisingly surprising). I almost fell asleep three times, and my review will, unfortunately, be more limited than that. Please, Mr Jobson, what you did before driving this sedative of a movie, come back to it!
