I read reviews for this, and while I did not expect a private rescue Ryan, I was expecting a movie of a certain substance. The film starts very lob-verse with the usual introduction of history and how the unity came into being. But right now it's 1944 and you're not sure who he is. Emphasis, etc. are very weak because this unit should be Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone talks very little about the Japanese imitation of Harvard's English. I gave this movie 3 out of 10 in 10 minutes, I could not follow. The character was dimensional and even if they were probably based on real people, I had no feeling for them and that made me worry. Very poor direction of a very media TV movie that will be shown at midnight on a particular cable channel. I would avoid and look at better efforts. This is a good story, but it deserves a better understanding. You felt the director saw a band of brothers and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch a band of brothers, Tuskegee aviators, Glory or any other movie like when the trumpets fade ...
