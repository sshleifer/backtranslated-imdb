I wanted to love this movie. How can I not like it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all the icons in their own way. However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the whole experience for me. Her act was so frightening that I stood there with an open jaw without my eyes or ears. I just managed to get through a view, That's how hideous it is in this. Cary? Wonderful and dramatic fine. Jayne? Adorable, dear and obviously having a ball. Unlike the city of San Francisco, the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning and retro elegance. Then you see that Suzy Parker tries to speak his lines with a glow, a death, a cluelessness that simply defies the faith. Who told this creature that he could act? Oy VEY, people.
