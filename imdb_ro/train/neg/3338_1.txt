It took 9 years to complete this movie. I think in those 9 years, someone would have said, hey, this movie is terrible. I saw a better action in porn movies. The story is tired and played. The abused child turns into a serial killer. How about something new for a change. How does the abused child turn into a florist? At least that would have been a new turn. Why is it that everyone who has a room idea and a movie (especially non-original film ideas) thinks they can be directors? I admire that they have stayed with this film for 9 years to complete it. It shows tenacity and spirit. With this kind of unit we hope next time we can focus on a better scenario. If you want to see a failed experiment in making an indie film from a Michigan writer / director, see the one-minute hat. If you want a good film from a writer / director in Michigan to go with Evil Dead.
