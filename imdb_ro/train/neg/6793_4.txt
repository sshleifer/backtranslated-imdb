Cruel, dusty west of director Richard Brooks, who seems to be deeply concerned about the genre, while keeping all the usual clich√©s. In the early 1900s, the horse contest attracts a courageous cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave player (James Coburn), a small kid (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprising Candice Bergen game). Once the preliminaries have gone out of the way (with the foreseeable arguments on whether a woman should participate or not), it becomes a fairly delightful entry, though one does not destroy any new reason (resembling something from Gary Cooper's age). It looks good, if the long piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the plot mechanisms become tiring quite quickly. ** from ****
