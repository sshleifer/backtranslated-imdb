If there is a hell, it contains a screening room where GRAND CANYON always plays on an eternal loop. The presence of many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - may help compensate for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity). . But no. They seem to have injected these other actors with a McDonnell serpent. The whole business is pretentious, exaggerated, insulting (if you are deaf or know someone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil in the absurd scenario of TDD). GRAND CANYON is filled with ordinary, self-interested people, but never gives us a reason to like / understand / sympathize or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are insufficient losers that the genetic pool would be better off without. There is no plot to talk about, no character development (these people will never develop), no breaking performance, and the most archive writing you'll ever encounter in a movie. Best thing about GRAND CANYON? His title. This is a great HOLE of a movie.
