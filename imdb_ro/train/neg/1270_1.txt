Herculis Puaro is generally a well-established "hero" we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story does not work and I felt it was not Agatha's fault. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerated and make stupid gestures, the costumes are so clean and orderly that all (even the Arabian clothes) look fake for the serious spectator who thinks twice that this movie can be seen as a comedy drama mystery. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro does a nice job, but it's not fantastic. Scenes are, as has been said before, perfect and pointless. The story is not very delightful, though a murder mystery but cares for the death of a blonde and vicious 45 year old woman in the Iraqi desert? The "victim" is not pleasant.
