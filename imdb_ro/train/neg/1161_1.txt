As a member of the show, I was a member of the band in all basketball games, I would like to tell the world after being in the movie that we have not been allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director who broke the contract with the University of Oregon where he was shot. Apparently the U of O has been displayed. During the filming, we were allowed to eat more meals with the distribution and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable because he was one of the worst men I've ever met. Quite a long time for a 20-year-old. Of course, it was not campus life in the late 1960s and early 1970s, despite what Hollywood thinks. Oregon trombone player
