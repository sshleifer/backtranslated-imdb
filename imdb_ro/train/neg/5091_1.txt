My comment refers to the Russian version of Space Race called Battle for Space (Battle for Space) presented on Russia's first channel during April 10-13, 2006. The wrong translation could have destroyed some details, but I doubt it is the case. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (development of the first missiles). Even the half of the US film contains more errors and omissions. The public is not told about the V-2 / A-4 releases from the U.S. Three different Jupiter C missiles are launched with the same "EU" serial number on board. Apollo 1 will be released on the Moon, etc. In the middle of Russia, every person is ridiculous. Korolev is scared by NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and traitor, Mishin is alcoholic, etc. Men as Functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniforms and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song waiting for the release (I think this has been added especially for the Russian version).
