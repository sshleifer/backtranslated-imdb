The actor is a bad sound, ALL jokes are superficial, and the target audience is clearly very young children, assuming they have average IQs. I realize that it was meant for children, but also for Malcom in the middle of it, but still throws in humor and in adult situations. What should we expect from a show run by Bob Saget, the only comedian in existence that is less fun than a ball that hits a beard, why he probably ceased to host America Funniest Home Videos. Parents, do not let your children watch this show if you do not want to save money on college. Expose your children to stupidity and they will grow worse.
