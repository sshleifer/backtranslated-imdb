I did not have anything to do last weekend and tagged with my friends to see a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie I did not see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go in for that. BIG MISTAKE. This is a movie that can only attract children. Oh, and it's not like I do not like movies targeted at the younger audience. But this movie has absolutely nothing to keep my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, go to bed. Better than scatter hard earned money. Go to the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a baby :)
