"Shadrach" was not my favorite movie guy. It seemed too sentimental to me and the act was under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not credible. I also did not think Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper who lived in the house. Their social classes were too distant to consider this credible. It seemed Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. It was a scene at the beginning of the movie, which showed that Andie MacDowell came out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was? Her son? What was the scene that was supposed to show us? Why was the scene included? It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and has never been hinted at. It seemed free and did not match the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me. The story about Shadrach was nice, but I was not convinced that Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
