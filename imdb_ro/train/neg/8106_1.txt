Seriously, why do the American and Frech actors who claim to be Czechs have to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I am a man, so I enjoyed free nudity - but a soft porn movie would have more than that, and at least would not claim to be artistic. All the political statements in which doctrinal pains have heard the director of subtlety? The actress was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. The characters were very superficial and could not identify them at all. The little thing I laughed at was when they cut the actors in the archive pictures of the Prague demonstrations - and they were white and then the sepia to fit the movie - just ridiculous. I read many of Kundera's short stories (not the unbearable Luminosity of being), and there are good things about his writing style (though his themes are a big masculine fantasy) - and I have to say that the film did NOT convey any kindness to the style Kunderas.
