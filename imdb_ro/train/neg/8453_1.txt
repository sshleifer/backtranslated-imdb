This movie is a mish-mash mish-mash of the clich√© from the recent cinema. There are some promising ideas, but while the director clearly had the goal of ending with an ambiguous, truly ambiguous film, what he got was a confusing misery. Actor Daniel Wu is doing a fair job, but without a central theme he does not have much to do. In addition, the film is largely devoid of scarecrows (though, rightly, there are some ghastly moments in the midst of witchcraft). * The mysterious death of twin librarians, alienated devils, ghost love interests, identity confusion, death of wild monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive tattoos, sublimed homosexuality, and bandwidth ties crime. The only real community that these elements share it seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague feeling of confusion and dissatisfaction. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that despite the monkey brother's death being strongly featured on the DVD's cover, the act itself is never shown directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be the monkey stock image - not very scary. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an excellent story of psychological and ambiguous horror, check out the Korean movie "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003).
