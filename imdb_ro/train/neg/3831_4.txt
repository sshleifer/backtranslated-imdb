I will have to disagree with the previous comment and introduce Maltin in this regard. This is a second, viciously overwhelming rate, which squeaks and groans, trying to put its central theme of the Wild West, being tamed and struck by the constant march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but he does not have the poise and the charm of the film. Andrew McLaglen's leadership is clear, and the last 30 minutes are a real botch with an incomprehensible strategy from heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me a bad luck if you explain why they put the fire on the hill). There was something hasty about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction did not really sound like that. Coburn is very ugly because the middle of the race has escaped condemnation to take revenge, but all of his escape colleagues are underdeveloped (these are like bowling bolts to be crushed one by one as the story shines ahead). Michael Parks gives one of his usual, mischievous, dirty performances, but in this case it was appropriate because his modern-day sheriff symbolizes the satisfaction that technological progress can bring.
