I spent eight years in cinemas in the '80s and' 90s. This was, by far, the worst movie I've ever shown to the audience. One thing that made it so bad was that he put the air to try to be a big, inspired movie. Even the great Gregory Peck has failed to save this horrible piece of being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in an earlier role in the horror movie, has clearly demonstrated she has not yet learned to act (she is still trying but is not much better). I'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will not just happen because it makes kids fear to play league baseball! Even the shows at Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us think that this game is not worth it. It's not worthwhile to waste time when watching TV by cable. It's not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent for an extra packet of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it can be better than that).
