Take the Frankenstein Base Flick, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Of course, this was obviously inspired by the films mentioned above, but never materializes as nothing special on their own. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife so that the whole movie takes place overnight as he attempts to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut parts of the body from some women who have failed and decides to stay coincidentally at night in his place. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that acting is bad, not directing. Everything here is just too standard. What little attempts there is humor, actually work (check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very angry if she saw holding a woman and a needle in her arms) , but that's hard enough to recommend this movie. Music is decent, what the blood that is there is decent, and the actors look pretty good. And for half the time, I was even amused by this movie. But I never felt that it was more than a waste of time. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
