First of all ... What the hell? Why the world is trying to sell a piece of bad budget on TV late at night with the promise of worrying, offensive, offensive garbage that any normal human being with a soul can not look at. <br /> <br /> What the hell is it funny for a dog to be hurt, a grandmother to cut his head ... a guy who gets his hand and two girls go to the bathroom? what the hell did this world find people find comedy in something so completely sick. Anyone who believes that such material is funny should not even be allowed to go to the ground. <br /> <br /> But what I hear is not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through sick heaps of sick garbage ... and I can not even pull this.
