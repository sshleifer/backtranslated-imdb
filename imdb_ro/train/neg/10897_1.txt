This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! It was bad that there was no plot and the special affections were ridiculous! And I've never seen it so bad in my life! The only good part about the film was all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people were thinking when they made this movie! I did not even want to finish everything because you get to this point in the movie where boys are all in bed, touching themselves. I mean, it was like a bad and twisted pig! I would advise someone who heard about this movie and was interested to see that just forget about him and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed! The whole movie was a total waste of time in my opinion.
