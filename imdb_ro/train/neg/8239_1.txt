This is really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I just have no idea how someone has the courage to put this to release. Production standards are atrocious. There is no claim here at cinema. Working with the room, the scriptures, the actors and the sound are incredibly expensive. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes, saving us time to track it. Neurotic hysterical girls at the center of this piece have no credibility. I will urge anyone to avoid any time or money on this title. It is truly atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
