This film represents the hours in which it was made, as much as the original, I suppose. What is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title "Original Point of Escape" is so ironic. I'm sure it was not meant this way, but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971. The "REAL" OLD POINT was the end of an era, which ended in the early 1970s. <br /> < > In this remake, all counter-cultural elements have been stripped off and several PCs have been made in an attempt to reach a wider audience, perhaps. "Sanitized for your protection" The introduction of American Indian scenes was free, and the idea of ​​a "noble goal" for the trip was the drop by addition. I'm glad I followed him, though, made me appreciate the original much more. The original is a classic and golden cult. This remake is terrible.
