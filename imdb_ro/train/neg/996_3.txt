Vengeance is one of my favorite themes in the movie. Moreso, "useless revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the movie. After seeing Gaspar Noe's Irvresible (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak, half-hearted attempt that only expressed the lack of conviction and concentration of the film. * SPOILS * The final scene, a free rape / male torture scene, appeared as a fantasy female revenge vengeance. However, the film does not even follow this. Instead, the extracted scene (which goes beyond the brutality of the initial rape, as much as it was graphic and ritualized) is crowned with a picture of Dawson's face in an expression of regret or "" does not fix anything " while the rape of her violator is heard going on in the background. My problem with the scene was not a shock but a confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to reach the audience, that is, we feel sorry for We are delighted with Dawson's revenge We are disgusted with the brutality of all of us Do we feel Dawson's regrettable moment of shame? In addition to this failure, the film is truly a weird, more style-like substance. is monotonous, etc. Normally I try to make movies on their own terms, but Descent did not seem to know what they were. The thumb down.
