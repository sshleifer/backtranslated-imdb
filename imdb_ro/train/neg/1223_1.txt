What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of "War Games 2: The Dead Code", now "While It Was Out". I try to reach a decision that was worse about pain in my mind while I look. I think "While it was out" it was worse. Everything has been said before in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical etc. - the only thing we have to add is that at some point it started to feel more for the bad guys than for the woman, because I would be recommended her for a Darwin award if she died (just saw the first half, so I do not know). Soon I went to two Darwin awards (if possible) for her immense stupidity. And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So she not only knew the scenario, but was she also responsible for bringing us a loss of money to people? I think people who waste considerable sums of money to be bad because the money could have nurtured and dressed quite a few people, instead of killing 80% of those who saw it in cinema and offering 20% ​​idiots , the ability to show how much an idiot is.
