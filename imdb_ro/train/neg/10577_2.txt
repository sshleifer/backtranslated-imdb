Some of the producers taking part in this series made some very good movies, but they did not show up well in this series. Especially writing. Okay, the first season was a bit better, but these new episodes just create smell. I am a great fan of horror and, in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. Nothing new or really exciting. Few of them are visual creatives. It's just a typical stupid Hollywood nonsense, uninteresting, childish, ill-conceived and, in some cases, ridiculous. Like Tales from the Crypt, the only good thing this series offers is nudity great! Other than the fact that this series blows hard. I have the impression that they hired a bunch of eighth grade students to write the episodes. Maybe they did.
