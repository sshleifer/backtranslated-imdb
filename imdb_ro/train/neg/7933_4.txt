I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this movie is stupid. The whole thing has a preserved, fake, symphony that feels with him, with a really terrible projection on the screen. He has a good idea about the plot that the screenwriter has been buried successfully in a nature scenario, making it impossible for the public to immerse themselves in action and take care of any of the characters. Directing is pedestrian and emphasizes just how bad the script is, rather than helping him improve it. I've seen a lot of good sound productions, but this is not one of them. All he does is make you appreciate the expensive Scott / Boetticher movies all the more. Randolph Scott is tanning, holding and shining the smile of millions of dollars throughout the year. He's always a pleasure ... even in his worst movies. Apart from Scott, the other reason I wanted to see this movie was due to how much I liked Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's "Rocky Mountian." In "The Man Behind the Arms," ​​she is just as beautiful and you can say she's a good actress, but she was forced to say some bad lines, and the blockade she gave the director was really dreadful. I saw Phil Carey in the Pacific Operation, and he plays the exact same character here ... an arrogant pain in doubt that you want to fight unconsciously. I think he shows he's a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts to relieve the comic, which, in my opinion, can only affect the movie. Although there are many elements to beat, I have to say that I really woke up enjoying the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but that's why we're not going to see Randolph Scott's movies, right? > There are certainly Scott's more expensive films, and certainly this is not unbearable, but certainly can not be considered anything but mediocre.
