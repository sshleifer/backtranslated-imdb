Sneaky comic about a cosmetic seller with strange connections with Elvis Presley, who descends into a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while talking at the Nevada conventions ... and accidentally killing each of them by her fault small. Kim Basinger, an appealing actress with considerable merit, wants to choose strange movies, but this terrible screenplay (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have a good feel. Stereotypes and small balloon galleries are not meant to be classical comedy, but even at a shameful, shameful level, the picture is gross and negligent. If you look, see if you can count on how many foreign pictures are from Basinger behind the pink Cadillac wheel, always hands in the same position and with an unperforated look on your face. Let's hope she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS from ****
