I will not waste time writing an essay and wasting your time. I would, however, like to say that all those who are inclined about this film, even if made, are absolutely ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play that book and I mean a nationalist patriotism book, so people do not watch this movie. this is a movie that expresses the free will in this country (oh, I played that book) even if the director is German and deserves a slap on his wrist every time he arrives for a room but the world is full of controversy and is the same something you've heard before, like GTA's controversy. It's a comedy, it laughs and it's disgusted, not disgusted together, its dark humor and obviously you do not have the heart to take it, the past is past, yes, people remember those who lost, but time to go far, it was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Apart from being crazy and who needs a soul?
