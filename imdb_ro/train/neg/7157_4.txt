He watched 5/26/2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange story about a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting the body of her grandchildren. At least I think it was the relationship. Some kind of extraordinary qualities take place throughout this film, unlike Stephen King's Shining movie. The difference lies in the fact that Nicholson's performance has not existed too much, which is not at all in this film. This is taken very seriously until the end of the year, when some steel lining and attempts to prepare the mood are not working at all. Performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very well, and the spectator is left with a lot of information and without a real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small interpretation of Christopher Walken as the granddaughter's uncle, who, of course, gives him a top-selling fee in the attempt to sell the film. Do not buy in this game and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
