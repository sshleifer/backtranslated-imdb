Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) murdered the child and his wife attacked viciously in an invasion at home. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through post-traumatic stress. Then, Archer faces a man (Til Schweiger) tied and gagged to a chair. It is said that this is the man who killed the child and attacked his wife and can do whatever he likes. And there is a vast assortment of instruments there to help him ... The film is interesting at first (and shows real retention in terms of blood and gore) but it becomes stupid for minutes and has some very unlikely twists and turns . Everything ends in a last turn that was so old and bad that I was shocked that someone would still use it. How talented actors such as Eldard, Schweiger, and Plummer are involved in such nonsense as they are beyond me. This becomes three stars for acting, but the stupid plot and really incredible twists make it a chore.
