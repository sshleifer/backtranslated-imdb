This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I really like terrible horror movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main defect is the lack of explanation of creatures. When they entered the house and found the man he could have leased to explain. He says nothing but killing his parents, and if he had not missed me, he did not say how he managed to escape ... Not to mention that he does not give any clue or reason for who only survives and essentially nourishes creatures after his close experience of death. He would have seemed to have had the opportunity to go after the "cross-incident."
