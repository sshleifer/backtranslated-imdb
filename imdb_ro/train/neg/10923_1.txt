TV film about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the USA in the 1920s during the filming of DeMille's first release of the 10 Commandments and resumed when DeMille's sets are discovered in the desert. One of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. The question is that movie makers were serious or joking when they made this movie? If this is serious, it is a bad movie and a wonderful movie to find them for the worse. If a comedy is less good, but funny for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh a lot and hard on this movie, probably more than many other "comedies" in Hollywood.
