As a huge fan only in the first two seasons of the BSG and the BSG Razor stand-alone feature, we hoped that this version will bring the franchise back to its original glory days. Usually, I have no problem with fictitious science, which is most of the dialogue, unlike a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas provided by good actors, you can create a profound film with little to spend CGI. This prequel does not have any of the above mentioned requirements going for it. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist adolescents was ridiculous and unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that adolescents do not love bullets of virtual reality full of sex and violence and heavy dance music. The part about the same teenagers who have intellectual depth and rationality or political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or to become suicide bombers that bother me. These kids are not on this planet. The movie runs like a soap opera with just the last 10 minutes being a little interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving him cyborg a conscientiousness becomes by upgrading the student's firmware was funny if not fun. But this old concept was much better portrayed and much more credible in the brilliant original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica destroys the only interesting idea of ​​an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, this film was unclear and inexpensive and cheap, using CGI's recycled Caprica from BSG. I doubt I'll look at this space soap when it's premiered on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless, of course, it happens to suffer from an insomnia bad, at which point this show would certainly be the cure. Zzzzzzzz
