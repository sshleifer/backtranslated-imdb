This movie is so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq tried to make other crossover efforts, such as his work in Shaq-Fu for SNG and the crowd of unbearable rap albums, and later, the horrific shooting epic service, which is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is no good thing about this movie. I've seen a lot of times when I was very young, but I was probably an idiot, because this movie takes everything that's good about the movies and breaks it apart. It's fun to run. I saw Disney Channel a while ago and spent a few minutes doing that. Though once the scorn of scorn is done, you are still overwhelmed by its terribleness. If you watch it on TV, try this: think as you watch the movie, removing all the scenes in which Shaq uses his powers of magic. If you do that, it becomes like a movie about a pedophile who follows a child and kidnaps him to seduce him. It's kind of fun and disturbing. A horrible movie example. No, unless you want to beat yourself, you see this movie.
