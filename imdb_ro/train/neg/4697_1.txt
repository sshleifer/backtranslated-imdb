Okay, I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. First, the movie is positioned and not real, all acts. I can not sing. They are too full of themselves. It's terrible. Yes, children from 8 to 10 could enjoy, but they were stupid. I mean they say their manager is a kid. And the label label is false. It's a stupidity. You do not see him. <br /> <br /> As for setting up and conducting, not so bad. It's a nice documentary, but it's documented a stupid thing. <br /> <br /> Only see if you do not like good music. It's also very stupid. It's not even good. I do not like being so bad ... but this is a piece of junk.
