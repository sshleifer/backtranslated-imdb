I had to change my mind about the worst movie in the world that just saw this one. This is! <br /> <br /> Do not make any mistake this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> The hopeless story (despite the fact that it is based on the true story). The right to act (what Judge Reinhold thought). Children Dialogue. Continuity nonexistent. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
