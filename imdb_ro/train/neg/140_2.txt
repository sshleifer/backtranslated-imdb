Valentine is a terrible movie. This is what I thought about this: <br /> <br /> Action: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The others were not much better. Story: The story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This movie has the potential to be a great movie, but it has failed. Music: Yes, some of the music was pretty cool. Originality: Not very original. Name "Paige Prescott" Recognizes Prescott? Bottom line: You do not see Valentine. It's a really bad movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
