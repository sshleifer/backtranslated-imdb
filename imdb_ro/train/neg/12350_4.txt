Hmmm ... where to start? How was a serious actress like Demi Moore involved in such stupidity? "The first blood" could be rated as a bull, but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course, if you're interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY seal), the stupidest cliche I can think of, you'll say that "GI Jane" is a great movie. Only performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie supportive, but hell, I can not think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott is not worth the credits to make this film one that comes for women with equal rights, it's just brainwashing for the US Army and to make it more attractive, they have left Moore in it. Horrible movie.
