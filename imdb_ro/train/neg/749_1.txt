No Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come with budgets of about $ 2 million. Some of them have an activity with extensive effects, others have recognized discourses, and others have functions for both $ 2 million. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that it was probably produced for $ 750,000 if it is not considerably smaller than it. Few sets are used, a number of scenes are shot against the green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is low, badly executed and wrong, but because many of us have been watching the progress of this production for some time and have had great hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced joined the legions of those discussed by PT Barnum.
