An interesting vampire concept that has something to do with a virus (but done several times so far). Generally, the movie is too long and pulls a bit. Editing could have been stricter. I'm sorry to hear about the credit issue. Perhaps the film was rushed to come to the market. The light was too dark in places. But the most serious technical problem is audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have an echoing sound for them, which is very distracting. Or they were not careful in recording, or the mixing of the sound could have been better. Also, the background noise has passed too much. He should have made somebody make sound effects for martial arts scenes. The silent clank of swords that struck together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in battle scenes, the editing had to be stricter. Also, the act was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see the same person writing and weighing in a movie, my experience is a red flag. But it was a good effort, so I gave her a 4.
