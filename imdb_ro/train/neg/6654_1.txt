Usually, I do not think Hollywood productions are suitable to be called a movie, so I call them instead of movies. But this piece of elephant garbage is not even suitable to be called a movie, hence the headlines. Where should I begin? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certainly a symbol of it. Stefanie Powers should play someone even less than half the age, she should play an age of 18 and she is FORTY effing DOU !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible and stupid portrayal of Paris and France, where we see clichish characters such as the shop-loving owner, the angry queen of models, the mother of the god, the former queen of models, etc. This film is overwhelmed only by this respect through the Da Vinci Code (which the reviewers have correctly set up a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is extremely ridiculous not to have nudity in a movie about a time and a place where nudity is a place so common, especially if all the attention is related to it. <br /> <br /> 4. Horrible accents! <br /> <br /> 5. The music of Nana Mouskouri !!! <br /> <br /> I could go further, but I think this is enough. And I managed to make these observations after seeing this shit for only half an hour, When I surf the internet and talk to my friends about math equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> I invite everyone to add you to my list. :): D: D
