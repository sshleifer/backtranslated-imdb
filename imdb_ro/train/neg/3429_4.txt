I received a copy from the writer of this movie on soulseek. I have to say it's pathetic and just painful to watch these two cops, but I looked at the film as a joke and since it's a tribute to August's underground that I've seen in my book as a wonderful movie. Quality and everything about it is pretty bad, but it's fun and something to talk about with your friends. It reminds me of things thromma, but good. We recommend seeing this under two conditions if you feel bored and need a good or high laugh, otherwise just let it be. Download recommended safe. and the killing is pretty funny. like when the zombie rips the Satan culturists spin around and stir up someone with her.
