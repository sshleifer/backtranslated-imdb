I have to say it's a terrible movie, for the simple fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it's listed as a documentary. As I watched him, I started laughing, thinking, this guy is expecting me to think it's true? So I had to look for it now and see it as a movie, but now, since it's not a documentary, it's a bad movie now. So anyway, it's pretty bad. In fact, we have not succeeded. I had to stop it. I'm a New York police officer and I felt someone was trying to make people mistaken to think it was a documentary, with the intention of making money for a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So we took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by it and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
