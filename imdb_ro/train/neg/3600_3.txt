A question for all the girls there: If a man you have never met before has accidentally called you and you have continued to do so at the most indiscriminate moments, you would have intrigued him or would have been scared that Will you call the police? Yeah that's what I thought I could not swallow the idea that Marti Gerrard would bring Connor Hill's helpless attention to MILD SPOILERS ***************** This is a story really stupid. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question is that Connor calls on Tuesday so he can have an alibi? But is there a massive logical discrepancy here that Connor did not hire a man who hit it? which seems to have ignored the accusation. And there was no crime at the crime scene? So why is the whole process based on Connor calling on Tuesday at the time of the murder? Dumbass . Dumbass . Dumbass . And it's as predictable as it is without brain. My further memory of this film is that for someone who made the Winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a truly downhill skiing descent
