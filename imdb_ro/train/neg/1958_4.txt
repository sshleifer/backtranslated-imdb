Where to start. This movie started out as something that looked like a broken-off by "Darkness Falls". An old, disfigured woman who lives in the woods, giving her a gift to her teeth. Sound familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls," the toothbrush just killed you if you saw it. The toothbrush in this movie has killed you no matter what. Why do they need a rocker, a hippie girlfriend or Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would have been okay without them. It seems the producers have sat around and decided they should have put people in the movie, just like the tooth of the tooth to kill people. Although it is nice to see a beautiful blonde girl who is not portrayed as a balloon for a change. Okay to rent, but I would not suggest to buy it.
