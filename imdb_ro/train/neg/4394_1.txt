The John Goodman program was pretty terrible, but this is just a smell. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was the recognition of Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who crushed the rebellious childhood memories, but never gained a sense of perspective for adults in the years to come. Paranoia rules the dark world of these characters. Everyone is unpleasant and for no reason. The plot is predictable, but the show sneaks from an inexplicable scene, unrelated to another, in such a useless way that it's not fun to watch it. The worst thing is that no one in the production team seems to have ever seen snow!
