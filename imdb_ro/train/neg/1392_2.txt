"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine," but video people thought better about it; the screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; is a kind of movie. The government has a primal interest in this brain machine project, which has produced four people - who turn out to be naturally a philosopher, a horrible priest, a crackpot veteran, and a patriot who made an abortion - falling room with a computer that can read horrible horrible thoughts. Finally, the government takes over the lab, and everyone dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in any important way; MY s *** has better production values ​​than that. He kept my interest, however, only to see what these creators of exploits really believed, in a drama of characters with four boys. The answer: a tract about how science is inferior to God. Thanks a lot. It's like opening an egg kinder and getting your 30th jigsaw puzzle. The priest is performed by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, Gerald's philosopher "Republican Simon" McRaney. Also, offering many, very, very long stabilizations and large-scale transition shots, this moves almost as slowly as the liberal convention.
