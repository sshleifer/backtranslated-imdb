I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there is only one song at the end, which is just a guy who yells "Yaowwww!" while someone randomly knocks on a wooden object. That being said, there are some beautiful songs, but it is not worth watching the movie over. Go to the itunes (have the album), preview them and choose the best ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who makes tea. Well, that's a little exaggeration. But you will see what I mean if you see it. This being said: YOU DO NOT!
