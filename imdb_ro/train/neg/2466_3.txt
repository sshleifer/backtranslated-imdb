Over the last few years, there has been a vogue for zombie-related films, often as ironies, as well as other media incarnations of those who live in the flesh and who have raised the dead. "Fido" is a movie that is either an attempt to make money, just a manifestation of it or both - and it falls into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we see that dead walk lies in the contradictory context of a stereotypical, pure and brilliant alternative history (we are following a great zombie war and the creatures are now domesticated as slaves) version of a suburb of the 1950s. > <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a funny concept on its own, and probably enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can not resist a feature film on its own. The joke that throws dead bodies for servants is incongruous with this idealized version of a small town that is always repeated and loses its full efficiency. The soundtrack tirelessly plays sunny melodies, while zombies cannibalize passers-by. The word "zombie" is constantly introduced into a familiar line, otherwise familiar, for a cheap try to laugh. <br /> <br /> The very wide and artificial representation of the 'fifties' can only help me irritate me. It is so stylized, obviously inspired by Pleasantville, that it is more evident in the 1950s marking around what might have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something obnoxious shocking about this, as if the film boasts in a blank and careless manner about how much lighter, lower-ground and superior the 2000s. Because the characters are so wide-ranging of the 1950 pop culture, it is difficult to develop an emotional investment in them. Each has some character traits cast on him or her - Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves them on the bay and haunts them by having to kill his father - but they are still quite two-dimensional. Performances within the limits of this poor writing are good. The best is Billy Connolly as a zombie Fido, who, in Frankenstein's Boris Karloff's tradition, shares the character and the sympathy of a green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are small fragments of unleashed allegory thrown around commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, etc., but none of them really work at a comprehensive level, and manufacturers do not -adjust stick to anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not really go through the noisy joke of "Watch Zombies in" Let Beaver! "for a good hour and a half.
