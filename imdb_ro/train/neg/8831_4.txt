After I heard so many people thinking about this movie, I thought I'd let go of it. Apart from being incredibly slow, it does not bother me as long as it's worth it, but it just is not. Just as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this movie just does not sound true. The reaction of the four men stops shock, horror of finding the body to leave indifference while fishing. Surely if they were the kind of men who would go fishing happily, then they would have reported the body and said they discovered it just after their fishing trip ... why on earth tie the body with a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days before? It's so hard to watch a movie knowing the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the locals, you would well think that at least one of them could show some curiosity about who killed the woman! The body itself, naked, except for the pants ... which scenario leads to that? If she was raped, then why exactly the batons? If she was raped with her clothes, then why would you remove them afterwards? If she was not raped, then why take all her clothes off the bar? You really can not think of any realistic scenario that would lead to something other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill your jumble sale stand! Well, they are being watched, but only because, despite the bad script, the acting is strong.
