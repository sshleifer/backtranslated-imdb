I read the back of the box and spoke about Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful, I was so wrong, the story was messy, in fact, I still do not understand, it seems to me that all the characters have made her drink, smoke (opium?) And have sex. Not that these are not good qualities of the movie, but please! Where was the story? I got to finish the movie, and yes, it's over, but until then the movie is over. You really do not trust the back of the box.
