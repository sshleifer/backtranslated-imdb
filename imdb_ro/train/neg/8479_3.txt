Okay, when I came on board for this movie, I was really expecting people to have fun with it. I was surprised to see that people over 7 years old liked it. I liked the movie ... but only me and my sister (who is actually only 10) have a lot of fun. I'm sorry Jordan, but the action was terrible. You know a movie is heading for the toilet when the lead can not act. And he did not even have a scenario or a good plot to redeem it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very lame ... the dull boring edge. Even with this, I thought there were some good actors, like Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. However, it is not enough to redeem the film. Two things about this movie that they just can not overcome: 1.) That Spencer would fall for her. Okay, you are. I looked up and, in reality, she was just four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much bigger. Jordan is a pretty girl, but in GF, she looked like 10 or 12 ... it looked like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed a college student. 2.) Is there any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would just come to sketch for a girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it seemed unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that did not even have skating rinks or that a school would hire a skating trainer with such connections. Everything was said ... it was not the worst ever known film, but it was not very good even after the DCOM standards, which I consider rather low.
