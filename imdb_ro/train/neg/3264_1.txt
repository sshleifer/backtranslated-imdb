This snap, homophobic thing, was dated in 1976. It seems now that it's really scary, full of homosexual stereotypes and characters that must be laughing rather than with. Redd Foxx does his standard schic, Michael Warren at least tries to bring mankind to a unique character and Pearl - Pearl what did you think ...? Pearl Bailey deserves much better.
