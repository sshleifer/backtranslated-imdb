I will not criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It has good animal action scenes, which were probably quite amazing at the time. Clyde Beatty is not even a matin√©e idol. It's a bit mild and does not look good. But it's all right. He is the man in that lion cage. We know that when he can not lose his lion's time to straighten his girlfriend, he'll end up on an island with her, and he'll have to save his day. Someone said earlier that it is a history lesson. The circus scenes are another day, especially the kids who are spinning around them. I did not realize that even in the thirties they sailed on three masked schooners. It looked like something since 1860. I think that's the movie they had. No wonder things have been destroyed. I always talk about fixing her. There is even a dirigible. She tells us something about the male relationships of the female at that time, a kind of giggly madness. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
