I'm very tolerant of horror and science fiction movies and I've been watching them since I was four or five years old, so I've seen some very bad things, but I'm dealing with it. I've even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies, so I know I do not expect much - a very promising movie that is not talked about at all. Hope is springing eternal, I think - or the triumph of hope on experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog right from the beginning and I knew that, but, like a flame moth, I kept thinking about something, whatever would be interesting. It is not like that. All actors give a decent performance - given the scenario, I do not know how they kept all the right faces. It has something to do with collagen worm parasites, which slowly process the human race, one body at a time. There is a bad plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy, giving them the outside look of people ... do not worry, get what's coming. People at the job do not even know where they came from, they think they could have walked on a meteor that landed on the ground, but ... somehow know about the members of a kingdom between them - he managed to reproduce with a a human being who knows she is the queen of the worm and loves her for herself ... oh, must I continue? Please, please do not waste 2 hours of your life following this ... something would be better ... think about the worst and less pleasant way you can spend two hours ... would be better than that.
