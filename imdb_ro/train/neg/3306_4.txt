A very "old" old lady, despised by money to save her home and possessions, grows a "pot" in her home, smokes it with a few old friends, and then sells it. This is the story of this low key comedy, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor that the situation brings. For much of the movie, it works. Humor is not of the laugh-out kind, but it will keep you entertained for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> They are funny moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch the main role. But the end really ruined a "cute" movie with insulting-bad messages that only ultra-liberals in the movie world would like to happen. Like most people, I would prefer a happy end also, but they should not warm up and be disconcerting to those who flagrantly violate the law. Also, here are typical (1) children who are not in marriage, but this does not raise problems and is considered to be fair; (2) clergy represented as moral weak people; and (3) even a doctor who also has stones! <br /> <br /> Hello? And the reviewers here make Hollywood? This is an example where a secular society has reduced standards in the UK and Europe in general. Hey, people: they have at least a trace of morality instead of nothing but a message from Timothy Leary "If she feels good, do it."
