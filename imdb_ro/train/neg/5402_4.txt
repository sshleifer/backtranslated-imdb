This movie is so incredible; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as the film implies is ridiculous. The vampire himself would not have looked out of place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the act is so woody that actors have to be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for the day someone makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (except possibly Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do - lack of money used for "special" effects, poor actors, awful characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, sticky and fails in everything it tries to do.
