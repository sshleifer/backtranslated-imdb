Dear God! I waited for this film to "start" ... then wait for it to be redeemed ... and when it never succeeded, I put it there, stunned that: 1) it could be so bad and 2) that I just he lost a few hours of stupidity. I trusted that Drew could not have done that badly by a movie ... and boy, I lost my faith! Do not bother with this! Drew tried it, but the movie was badly written, poorly acting and poorly conceived! I can not believe that such a bad scenario has ever been funded! He had a million chances to do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to qualify!) And STILL never went! It's just pitiful! If the other reviewer had the idea that it was not the worst, I hesitate! Because believe me, if it got worse I'd have cut my wrists before I finish it!
