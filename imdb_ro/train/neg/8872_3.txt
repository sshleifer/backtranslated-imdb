Major Payne was not good at all. Despite the fact that it was fun here and there, the story was ridiculous and the act was poor. Major Payne's voice and temper were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous, and the things the boys had to do in the movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
