This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it was supposed to be. You have to understand that this movie has never been meant to be taken seriously. It's camp, on the same lines as the "Army of Darkness". AoD was stupid, but fun and bad in a good way. "The House of the Dead" fails to be "good evil." There are inherent qualities in good campy movies, the most important of which being credible fantasy. You have to believe what happens in a movie to see humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without limits, the movie becomes absurd. HotD has no credibility. Still worse, HotD does not bring anything new to genre and repeats the same twists and turns of character that many horror films inevitably begin to expose. For example, too often, horror films fall into the trap, where the main characters find love among ghosts and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I'm being pursued by the zombies, I mean with a hot chicken. Believe? Not? Then you probably will not believe when the characters begin to suck each other's faces in this movie. Beyond the obvious issues that affect this movie like many other horror films, Uwe Boll chose to add scenes from the zombie video game being accidentally shot whenever a character shoots a zombie into the movie. Not only is there no clear reason for this artistic choice but distracts from an already unbelievable plot. Moreover, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad action and apparently no attempt by the director to guide actors' reactions to events ... leaving the film without redeeming qualities. Avoid...
