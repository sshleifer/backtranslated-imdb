This movie is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this film. Go on the Bus while seemingly anti-racist, it does nothing but beaten and degrades the black status quo. The film is about a group of black men traveling on a bus to Louis Farrakhan's monster march. The bus has all kinds of people you can imagine: homosexual, muslim, gangbanger and Uncle Tom (He is thrown off the bus though). The bus was just a white person. He was accused of being racist when he reached the bus to drive. Despite being a Jew and explaining the situation, he became a racist and left the bus. I do not like to say, but movies like this have to do their own hypokration and recharge of sterlotypes. This should not be regarded as a triumph, but a sad disappointment. I may think I'm a racist for writing this, but I mean good. More good luck next time Spike.
