Well, look good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer are again collaborating on a heist film mix, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But, my dear, this is for Indiana Jones Speed ​​2 is Speed. A reasonable distribution (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a poor scenario and loses badly. The movie is a bit more than an extended ad for freemasons. However, these Freemasons are not your regular craftsmen who use hand grip and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions "From Hell" or Jack Ripper.) I do not think I've unveiled some spoilers plot because there is none. There is almost no suspense, no surprises and no climax - it stops. The National Treasure follows Dan Brown but reaches the same intellectual level as Scooby Doo's episode without humor.
