Steven what did you hit a new low. It's weird since Steven's last filmmaker was directed by the same director who made this garbage. The man of the shadow was good this was evil evil so bad that it was not even funny Steven is hard in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo look and when he is in the movie he is dubious half the time anyway. As for the action, let's just say that the ozone sorcerer has more action than this trash can, that there is no action in the film at all and when he finally gets boring, depressingly shot poor so-called action scenes . Seagal does not kill anyone hard, unlike his films over which a man's army goes, that is under siege 1 and 2 and the wounds. the plot is so confused with so many plot holes that it does not make scenes at times. fly out of anger better be good what a shame I wasted 5 pounds on this trash 0 out of ten more luck next time
