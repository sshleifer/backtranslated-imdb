I have not seen anything so horrible as this movie for some time. The film was boring, a long and frightening plot. The special effects suck like hell - It's like seeing a movie in 1999. It's a total loss of one and a half hours of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speire, it was not that bad. Actually it's not bad at all. But in this film, his action was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Besides, his eyes seem to be naked as if he does not feel it. She surprised me, indeed, because it was good in the Band of Brothers. Anyway, do not even bother to watch this movie. There is a great deal of waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, do something else besides watching this movie. Believe me, you'll regret it!
