It's hard to make an impartial judgment on a movie like this, which had such an impact on me at an early age. This is undoubtedly the worst kind of exploitative film. I was pretty unhappy to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I would never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. Then I saw her again earlier this year and was terrified again. I'm not a zealot or one who says what others should and should not see, but I made a big offense for how something as horrible as rape was treated in this film. I like cinema lowbrow, but this is simply ugly. Rent on Rus Myer instead.
