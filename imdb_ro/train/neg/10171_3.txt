Comparison with American graffiti is inevitable, so you save money and time by renting that timeless classic. Speaking of opportunity, there was a Lucky episode, where Norm and Cliff competed with who can find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie all from some of the songs and some of the clothing was wrong. There were false references like "have the paved paradise to put a parking place." The producers hoped to get some smiles from us, but in reality they made me stir up. The characters in this movie are incredibly polite and social for teenagers. Almost as intelligent as the people who were in the thirties forty years when they wrote the filthy film. Very little of what the characters were saying were credible. Combine bad and bad writing as a movie this movie fails completely. Although there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams lived up as a future child and, despite what another commentator said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Showing a feature that could have been fully boiled in the event of its appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
