PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it me or this guy always manages to draw AB in their movies together?). Some attractive scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: The whole hour of 1 hour (the jokes were full of say at least). Every scene involves Rajpal Yadav. Major nonsense in AB decision making. Allow me to be right, he thinks he brutally insults his son's soul in any possible way (which probably destroys their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally assume a certain responsibility, then tell the truth? WTF? He thinks Akshaye is too soft to bear his old dad soon die from cancer, but he thinks he'll make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see the logic here? Easily the biggest flaw of the movie. - Akshay becoming a stuntman. LMAO !! We were told that he graduated first in college each year and has an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL!! How to actually apply for normal ur work? Or Heck, anywhere else where ur life is not in jeopardy? This is incredibly bad writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate melodramatic stupidity. Everything is pushed into the throat to pray the character of AB, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me a little of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "I'm sorry about the guy with the disease," the shit has gone on. I felt more like rifle than sympathy for the old man. He could not watch the last 20 minutes because of this and so he had to fast. everything. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Waqt is just too bad to be called a good movie. His obvious director, Vipul Shah, has targeted this at the chic and the old fragile emotions, who might be more careful about a story that actually makes sense. Give her some decent song paintings, luxury suits, a lot of glycerin scenes and some powers of the stars, and they will definitely block everything like that.
