This is the film that evokes the fear of D & D in the 1980s (and even today). The fear that people playing D & D (or any other role play for that) will be "sucked in" and lose their ability to distinguish the reality of fantasy (and kill spies, child sacrifices, suicide etc. .). A great movie for anyone who wants to blame society's problems on inanimate objects, but anyone who played a role-playing, video game, or even played in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It's for D & D what Wargames was for computers. Plus, like a movie, it's really stupid.
