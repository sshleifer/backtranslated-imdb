Knowing how terrible the Shield is, it should write pages and pages, so it's enough to say it's a monument to a bad direction. "When Go Awry Directors" should have been the title of this production. Indeed, executives should improve their work with a sense of visual style and stories that propel the story forward. How to constantly shake the camera and play with zoom lenses a "style"? How does the story propel before? Of course, there is also the "random number editing" node. It seems to have become hip just to cut off at random. I think it's too much work to do good editing. Well, that's done too much work for most people to look at a shield that has disappeared as one of the most exaggerated and unspeakable shows of all time.
