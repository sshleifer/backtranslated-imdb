Cybil Richards leads another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema erotic masterpiece. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in quite attractive silver clothing) has the task of destroying all the evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tapes and she likes them a lot. The sexual scenes are well filmmed and fixed on an excellent soundtrack (at least for this type of film). Distribution is mostly terrible and, in general, very medium. Jacqueline Lovell is her extraordinarily attractive self and viewing the sexual files that she can expose her to the chest and feed a little lower. It also fits into a little lesbian activity. To be honest Lovell deserves much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks very naked, but she is actually more appealing in her silver clothing that reveals "drama." The Lovell garbage truck and the soundtrack are the only real redemption features. Mediocre even for Surrender production and clearly a new low budget for them as well.
