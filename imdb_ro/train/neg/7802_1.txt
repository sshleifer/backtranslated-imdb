A chemical leak turns people into zombies. It's up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's a film from Andreas Schnaas, so you know what the bet will be. Bad is acting, terrible special effects terrible and no budget to talk about. Doubling is ridiculous with an R capital and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a word about this piece of excrement, much less the ten mandatory lines because of the guidelines that IMDb has put me on. Original review of a single word: Carp would not be tumultuous, so I have to review it and focus more on how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... I expect to think they can have enough words or lines rather to make this review go through. Which is cool, I think. So in summary: This film sucks balls, does not watch him. <br /> <br /> My class: F
