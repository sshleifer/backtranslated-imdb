I did not like the idea of ​​the female turtle in 1987, I knew TMNT were four brothers with Professor Splinter and their enemies, and each of the four brothers was named after the great artist, such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello, so Venus here does not make any sense or play no important part and I think the old TMNT series was much better than the new one containing Venus How a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story in TMNT that we knew in 1987 that we have new enemies on either side is a good point to have an action, but to have a turtle is a very weak point to have some action, we want to see more many TMNT series, the same characters I knew in 1987, without the turtle.
