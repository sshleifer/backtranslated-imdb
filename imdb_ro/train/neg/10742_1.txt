I tried to stay with this bomb not long ago. as a disaster. the action was atrocious. there were a few scenes of absolutely pathetic action that fell full like a lead balloon. this was mainly due to the fact that the actors' reactions did not sound real. It is obviously a modern recovery of the original "Lifeboat" Hitchcock. I think Hictcock would have turned circles into his grave right at her thought. From what I was able to suffer, there is nothing convincing in this film. It boasts a few semi-big names, but does not make any effort in their characters. You know, to be fair, it was not the fault of anyone. It means I'm pretty sure the script exploded in the first explosion. LOL.it It is possible that this finishes improvement as it goes along.but for me, I am not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so if you do not have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon , avoid this stinker / 1/10
