Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As a fan of Robin Williams, it seemed necessary to buy this movie as the first screen on the screen. Wow ... I did not imagine a movie more minded. Essentially, the movie takes a bad joke after another that your uncle Artie will tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second sketch. I'm totally humorous, but this humor was not like vulgar or rebellious ... it was just a mind. There are no redeeming qualities for this film, other than Robin Williams' fanatics, like me, who just have to have every piece of film.
