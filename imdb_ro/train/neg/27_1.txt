Horrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just filling. The film was bad. Why I have to expand that I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The actor sucks and the writings are just moronic. Bad in any way. The only nice thing about the film is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even this was destroyed by a terrible and useless rape scene. The film is a piece of badly made garbage and incredibly incredible. OK, now I'm going to IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 rows of minimal text. First I miss the time to look at these organs. Then, feeling obligated to alert others, I create an IMDb account just to find that I have to write a frigid essay on the film just to express how bad I think it is. Totally useless.
