I saw that this movie did not know anything before hand. The plot was terrible, lacking large information gaps. The film did not have the "battle of intelligence" I feel for myself. The actors just got him out of the mouth, sometimes they made me tear my teeth into agony as they stammered. The plot was predictable, except for the grueling homo erotic situation at the stomach at the end (not homophobic, but they made me physically sick on the stomach), even the end was predictable. And you could say that the detective was Jude Law in a suit, everything from the fake accent, the terrible dental work, the hair of the costume's facial hair, it all seemed to be a disguise. The whole movie was felt like a lost time in my life. This movie had the sensation of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as dolls and the house as a window to see the show, indeed, in my opinion.
