I would not give a film to a movie, it's not worthy. I just looked at him because I'm a fan of Pfieffer. I love her and I'll see everything he did. Even in this stick, she did not disappoint. Every scene with her in it kept the viewer looking ... waiting ... for something to happen, but nothing happened. They had some good lines, but ended suddenly as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had the potential, but it has not become anything of this. Pfieffer was 29 years old when he made this film for the most beautiful film. The closet and set were surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can almost look at something and rarely meet a movie I can not find something to please, but it was a dud. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about all of this, had a big rock hook at the end of the year. She had a scene that woke you up and told you that this movie is finally going to one place, then the credits are rolling. Good pain. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that 99 would have bought three cat food boxes and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. Well said. In fact, that comment was more fun than the movie, because everything compares so well. And I lost 99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
