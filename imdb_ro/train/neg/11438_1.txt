If there ever was a comedy worse than "Gray Matters," I'm not aware of it. The funny premise of New York comedy is that the Sam & Gray brothers are confused with a couple and so they decide to fix Sam with a girlfriend just to find that Gray is as attracted to their target - Charlie. The discovery that Gray is gay secret is only a surprise to her. There is a succession of deeply offensive weddings, a deep drunk act from Moynahan and Graham, and an interpretation that would make woods forests everywhere thanks to Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete incapacity to make a comedy and will want her to be excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays her family friend with lumpen insistence. Only Alan Cumming appears with any credit, but he is seriously poorly engaged and does not get anything to work with. The whole disaster is cemented by Graham's bizarre show, culminating in the penultimate scene in which he wears a comedy hat and a coat, despite the fact that the scene is in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this movie has ever been released but has no ransoming feature and should be avoided at all costs.
