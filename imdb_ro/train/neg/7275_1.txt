"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, even surpassing "Plan 9 in Space". The Lampoon film unfolds in three distinct and unconnected wineries, each representing different performers. The only common thread is the total lack of any ransom qualities. Perhaps there is one. Another commentator on this site said that the naked nude photos are beautiful and she is right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry gently give their wealth in the first and the second part, respectively. But their exhilarating exposures are, unfortunately, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround him and there is no one in sight. The third segment, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as a victory for this film. Benson plays the role of a young castor policeman who reports for the first day of duty, ready to release the streets of evil. He is associated with an old, cynical policeman played by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners showed up on their first patrol, we feel a possible redemption of the earlier failures of the film. Perhaps, perhaps, the old cinema will be reformed by the sense of duty and loyalty of its new partner. Maybe everything will end up happy in the end. But, unfortunately, this film is heading straight to the toilet, without redemption, without a happy ending, no coherent story. Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies," I thought we had already seen the worst schlod that Hollywood could bring. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it
