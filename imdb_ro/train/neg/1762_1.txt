This movie seems to be a rupture of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Allow the future viewer to point out that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the movie. William Baldwin continues to revert to the movies and, frankly, wonders if he has a great agent or is that directors and producers like the unusual strange look, comforted by the strange hairstyle he practices in most of his films. The only good film he has appeared is "Squid and the Whale," in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, her leading lady, is not much better at it; there is no chemistry between Mrs Pompeo and Mr Baldwin. A movie that will be seen at the risk of the viewer.
