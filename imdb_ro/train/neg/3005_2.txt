Slaughter High is your intrinsic 80-year emblem. A joke comes out of his hand, leaving a great guy burned. A few years later, the boy turns around and starts killing the people who hurt him. Now the story might sound interesting and fun, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the nineteenth-century filming is that it has some humorous flaws and continuity errors. The act is terrible, however, not as bad as anyone suspects. Although it does not help every character in the movie to be so thick and inexplicable. Leadership, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is easily the most tormenting of all and is supposed to share compassion and roots. Not to mention, this guy is almost too geeky and I think even geeks stereotypes would be crazy and simply directly antagonized by how he geeky him, so when he gets mauled, does anyone care? <br /> <br /> There is an unintentional laughing potential. Munro's lack of talent is quite obvious, which puts him at the same level as the rest of the dreadful film. However, the greatest fun is easily when the movie tries to question Munro, who is at the age of 30 at a time as a teenage teenager. And when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around his real age, the rest of the camp does not pass like an adult. All this goes well with a thematic song, which is a hilarious poetry of heavy metal thrash, accompanied by a maniacal laugh and a voice that shouts "I will do you". That's what Slaughter High says is not really a good movie, but it has a bad entertainment value. Perhaps it is essential for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect dilemma, suspense or any credibility on its part. Horrible!!!
