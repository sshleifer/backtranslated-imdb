I am 13 years old and I hated this movie is the worst movie on earth, I totally missed the time when I watched it and I was disappointed my cause on the cover, and on the back the movie looks pretty good, but I was wrong. but when I saw the delta it was totally different and a bad actress and I did not even know how old two girls tried to be so confused. the movie was in some parts confusing and I did not enjoy it at all, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it was going to improve but it was not, it was boring, boring and I said BORING.and I do not think many other people liked it, as well as me
