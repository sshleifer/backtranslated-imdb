Though there were funny moments, I thought the movie was pretty sluggish. The more he fled, the worse he got. Once the action went into Monument Valley, I woke up looking at the wonderful surprises more than the increasingly stupid and unbelievable interaction of the characters. The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First he deals with the business, then discovers the truth and makes the guys. Then he came back again, then deserted them again. Then he came back again. There is no apparent motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many missed opportunities. I should have said that the images were much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently people who liked Repo Man were inclined to like this. Searchers 2.0 is not a match for Searchers.
