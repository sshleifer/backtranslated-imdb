Perhaps he should have named this movie The Map because most of the stupid film is rotating around a map of a cemetery. Let's not talk about the same boring photographs of the map. The only thing that looks more than the map itself is the small beads of sweat that are constantly building on the forehead of our main character. Of course, this was how filmmakers have shown how incredibly tense things are on the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now, could not just show us one of the death scenes? We hear a lot about how all those who are listed on the map score like flies, but we do not get to see anything. Some like Bury The Living manged to keep my attention, so I was quite generous with the rating I gave, but I will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweats, we recommend renting a better movie, such as "I Spit On Your Grave" or "Drink Your Blood".
