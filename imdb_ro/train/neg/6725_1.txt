What could have been a busy and emotionally loaded character study is totally undermined by the foreseeable factor. Fox is fine as Nathaniel Ayers, Julliard's musician, who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra, until his schizophrenia battles lead him down the street and eventually wipe a row. Seeking a good story to amplify his career, reporter Steve Lopez (Robert "rehab" Downey) knows him and tells the story. Using every element of the classical movie "How I Hit the Skies", borrowing very freely from "A Beautiful Mind," taking the false "honest" attitude of movies such as "Rocky" - choose the sequence number - and whip up the 1930 Style Melodrama , everything left on the screen is a burned shell of a movie. This is a rebellious, cute, completely predictable and plays too often on our feelings. I do not like to say that, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will look bad to you. I really want to say something positive about this movie, but I can not. The act redeems it to some extent, but it is not enough to give it more than one star. Made strictly for TV movies. It's not worth the time.
