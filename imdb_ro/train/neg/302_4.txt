I really liked this movie. I like absolutely kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming part for him. Not that I do not like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should let Kenny and his girlfriend hot pitch the movie. Anyway, it's pretty boring in addition to a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There are not really too many celebrities in this movie, and most do not seem to say more than one line. Generally, this movie was disappointing. I would just suggest watching it if you received it with the DVD of the kenny vs spenny season (it's free on disk 3). Regardless of this production, I'm still very pleased to see Papal Chase.
