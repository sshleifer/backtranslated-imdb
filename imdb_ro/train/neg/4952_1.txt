Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I liked the animated series, and even Batman Beyond. I'm even reading a batman comic. As you can imagine - I was a little enthusiastic when I heard about this series, and then I was SLEEPY disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even start to compare with the original series. It's like a long commercial of TOY. No depth. And what the hell was the Joker? Who, in the most humble opinion, is Batman's best offender of all time and killed him. I would like to say that his design was the worst. In fact, I would like to say there was something about this series that was creative or interesting from a distance. In short (because you think I could say a lot more) DO NOT waste your time on this show or your money.
