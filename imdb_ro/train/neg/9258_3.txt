It is regrettable that someone has decided to get away from the best horror films of all time in my book. This bad copy steals a lot of material from the first three films that go right until they copy how people die and what will happen in the future to key characters and basically try to feed on three movies in one and fail. It even fails to create a good atmosphere for one (except for the strange exception where impressive choral music brings memories of old movies). The only thing we can be grateful for is that there was not Omen V.
