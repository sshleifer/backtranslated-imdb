I'm ashamed to write this review. I say this because those who read it will know that I stood in the whole thing and it is embarrassing to recognize the aliens as well. But I had to alert those who read IMDb's viewers' comments before watching a movie that does not look at it. I can do nothing. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is bad. The act is amateur. And directing, working on camera, sets, costumes, etc. are all the other. Let it go.
