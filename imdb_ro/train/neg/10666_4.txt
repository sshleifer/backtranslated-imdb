I'm a big fan of the 1930s movie and I'll look at everything I see in Turner Classic's new movies for me. So I hit a shot, after all, is the great Harold Lloyd who compared Chaplin as a silent movie comedy. I've seen much less of Lloyd's silent movies, but Chaplin, but I have to say that I'm a much bigger fan of Chaplin. Anyway, this movie was so flat for me that I did not finish it. I understand why his sound career was so limited that he did not work with very good material. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stoogi, Martin and Lewis, the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy are making boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this is very forgetful. I also wanted to see Adolphe Menjou, as I really liked in Paths of Glory, but his role here has not done anything special to me. Maybe he should have been in the box sooner, because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed like that) is before entering a ring. I can say there are many Lloyd fans here and this will not be a popular review, but I have to miss this compared to what else was there at that time, 4 out of 10. Do not look at it with anyone you try to as much as old movies, because he could not see another with you, very flat. For an alternative to someone who really enjoyed this or looking for less known comedies, we generally recommend "Kelly The Second" done a few years earlier, another nobody gets a boxing comedy with Patsy Kelly and a role support Charles Chase. These were both shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
