OK, we recorded this TV and lost the very beginning. The movie was about 10 seconds in titles (I suppose), so if something happened before I missed it. A lot of people say Mark Hammill is in this, I have not seen him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and obviously Stephen King doing some terrible things acting as a cemetery assistant. Alice Krige looks awesome outside the scene where she has the face of the cat or is in full alien face-up. Even with the titles of opening never really explained precisely what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence, I assume that there are cats bipedal that live by pulling out the life force from humans. I suppose I live a long time and these two are possibly the last of this kind. Add to this a very large dose of incest (Yeah, I thought it was a bit too suspect too), shapeshifting, killer cats and invisibility and you have Sleepwalkers. It's a very bad story that has no real explanation behind the two main characters and too many cameoes to try to distract from the simple fact that it's not enough to explain the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
