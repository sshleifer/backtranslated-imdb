I gave 1 to this movie. I can not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian cinematography, made such a stupid and ridiculous movie! All the stories of those involved in the film are insignificant, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola will radically change the themes and style in his next film.
