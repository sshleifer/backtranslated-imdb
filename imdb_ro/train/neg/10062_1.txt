Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do that to me? I can not believe ... this movie is actually worse than the first. I went to see this at the theater with my brother because my mom forced me to label myself ... oh, my God ... where do I start? Plot SUCKED. The voice acts SUCKED. Animated SUCKED. The end is truly amazed. If you liked this movie, YOU ARE YOU. And for Futuramafan1987, who said it was the biggest movie ever, you are a TOOL, PLAIN and SIMPLY. This is not a movie for anyone but ten years old, with guys who think Pikachu is God. I still cry until today thinking about this horrible movie ... and then it was Pikachu's Adventure ... it did not even make me start on that horrible misery of a movie. It is, indeed, one of the most boring experiences in my life. Do not go to watch this at any price. Bottom line: Get out, find every copy of this movie you can and burn it. Burn everyone, then continue to rent a good movie, such as Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
