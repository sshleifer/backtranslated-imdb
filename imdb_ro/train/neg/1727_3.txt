We have a lake. We have an animated meteor that collapses. We have a stop-motioned dinosaur of the hell killer. Okay, so we call this film THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmmm, two idiots, called Arnie & Mitch, to define the final definition of "comic relief". We also have to have a sheriff who really does not do anything in this movie and nobody listens to it. Aw hack, we are over half the movie and forgot to insert a bad guy! Do not worry, get a guy with a mustache, steal a store to show it's a bad guy, then open it somewhere near the lake, drive it down the forest, and all that for the sole purpose of end up as dinosaur snack food. This should work. A complete, clumsy mess this movie. Your logic will twist your mind to force your laughter. The first film that includes Dave Allen as a "stop watch supervisor". After that, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the middle of the nineties when Band was out of money to pay him, I think. The effects of the dinosaurs are charming, and the whole movie is quite unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing that can be said about it. Bad Badness? Yes. The logic of tilting the mind in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do a trick. 3/10 and 8/10
