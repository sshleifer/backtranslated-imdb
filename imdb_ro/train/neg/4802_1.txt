I gave this 3-year marriage and that's stretched out. Adrianne Curry is the dirty mouth, spoiled, controlling, and her biological past makes me laugh. She tells Chris she has a protective image and she has to avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and a different warp time. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will never have happiness after it's over. Her mother said she was an old cock and thinks this is her last attempt to regain her youth. Here are 2 very good people who will get into a nasty divorce. I do not think his old "Brady Family" will fit into his new life. I see they're locked up. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. They supported him and were there for him.
