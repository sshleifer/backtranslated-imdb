I'm a big movie fan. I like movies of all kinds. This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. I realize that she carefully follows the book, which raises the point where not everything has to be done in a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned several times. These characters are not weird, they are mentally ill. The things that are happening are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considering that they should be true. This movie had the sensation of Royal Tenenbaums, another film I hate, just Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less fun. <br /> <br /> I will never get those hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after I forgot.
