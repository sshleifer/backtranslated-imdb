Well, I was excited to start downloading an animated open-source movie just to be destroyed by a demo drum. The animation is great, the synchronization of the lips is terrible and you keep watching the movie in the hope of understanding what's going on, just to realize that nothing is happening. You do not feel excitement for the characters, just pity for the creators to waste time. I saw short movies with two emotions in half! This could be a great shortcut if you just had time to hire a real director. I'm sure everybody at Blender is delighted to present her software and playback capabilities, but I'm sorry that guys-story is what a movie does.
