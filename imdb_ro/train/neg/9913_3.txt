This is one of those low-priced TV movies, the characters seem to lose any sense. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father, is very good. But the story seems to believe faithfully. Whenever your mother is advised not to do anything, you know it will do. It's a little attracted and not worth watching.
