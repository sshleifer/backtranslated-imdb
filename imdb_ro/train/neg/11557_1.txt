* SOILER * It's False! Everything is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a gentleman and his cousin or his brother or brother or something like that wants the castle and the title for himself. So he invests this overly complicated and useless SCOOBY-DOO plan to lead Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie makes him pick up red and attack them. Do not even kill them. He lets himself sleep and the little girl disappears and he thinks he buried somewhere. If he looked at Evelyn's so-called ghost, he could say he was wearing gloves! God, what a waste of time. Do not be disturbed if you watch, rent, and if you bought it and did not track it yet, sell it. Quick! Do yourself a favor and stay away from the EVIL OF THE NIGHT, which came out of your mouth. I'm giving this CRAP-O-LANTERN sprinkler.
