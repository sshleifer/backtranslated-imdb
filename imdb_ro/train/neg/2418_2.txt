The first mistake you make in the titles of a movie is the use of "the dead dead" without actually having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure, it was a low-budget zombie movie - very low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. It was really not too bad considering the above, and showed an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an "R" for violence, you should give us beautiful pictures of the boys who are attacked. Women were so little used in this film that they could almost be classified as "homosexual interests." And I'm out of Oakland. There were a lot of shooting that took place and no policeman saw!
