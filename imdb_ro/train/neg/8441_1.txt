This movie was long and boring. Surprisingly, she was selected for Cannes, though they tend to like the pretense. The point is that, unlike other Dutch artists such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Even more, it has no kinematic quality. A long opening kick does not mean kinematic depth, it's just a long shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not identify at all. The actors did not shine under her guidance and sometimes seemed lost. Leopold tried, but it's not the talent we were hoping to be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another attempt.
