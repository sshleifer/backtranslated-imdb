This must be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were terrible, the act was b-movie, and the effects were simply qualified for the Nintendo 64. You would think it would do a bit more effort in it. Of course, it's a Scifi movie, so you have to expect a low rate, but that's the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, like a film of despair, this does well. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have actors and actresses known in this respect, it is hard to believe they have not realized that the quality of this film deserves time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics may have been good in the 1960s or even in the early 1970s, but come, this is 2009! I will not spoilers, let's say if you played "Jurassic Park" on Nintendo 64, you will be very familiar with what you see in this movie. Definitely not worth 2 hours he had to sit down
