MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT BEING SPEAKING, IS VERY SPOIL! Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This movie tries to be the best to be different from most movies like "Blair Witch" ... does not work ... just ends up looking and feels like someone had a cheap camcorder, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is not offered any real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... just the screaming sounds and wandering. The whole movie takes place in a truck, which means that the decent landscape is not in question. The five girls are really striving for what they have given them, but generally they meet as terrible actresses ... although with the material given is hard to appreciate if they can actually do ... they spend the WHOLE movie screaming , screaming and stinging ... so much so that half the time is hard to find out what was said and cameras are so bad it's hard to tell who said that. This film is a film of violent torture, but it's actually only five girls in a truck that screams in terror ... which literally sums up the whole movie ..... then we get to the end after it seems that 5 hours of shouting constantly and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus one finger. The only big finger (bring it ... your finger .... LOL) is for the poor actress who tried hard and probably lost her voice (and her pride) after making this horrible movie. Do not judge this poster ... you will be very disappointed.
