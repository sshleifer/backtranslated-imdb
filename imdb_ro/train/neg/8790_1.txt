I saw this recently and I liked it very much. I have read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (too bad, which was not extended.) The second story, I thought, was clicked. And that "California Dreaming", if we heard yet again ... Chungking Express is fine, but there is something that the main audience will catch it to see, such as "Crouching Tiger".
