All right, I recently had the chance to rent this thing and see Santa Claus conquering puppets. Although the children were more sadistic in SCCTM, I should have said that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish mission in Spanish 5, we all had to follow it. I usually tell you when we watch a movie, we all talk and eat food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept an open jaw there asking themselves what the next gentleman would do. Merlin would help Santa ?! or would his new robot come and save the day? I would suggest to rent it because it's the biggest piece of garbage I've ever seen and I like that for that. : D
