A cannibalist forest killer is on the prowl, and two couples of defeat could be the next source of protein in this basement of business on Friday in the costume of the 13th clone. There is nothing interesting to see in this case, the killings are surprisingly rare and when it happens they are completely amateur. It also adds mixed ghosts without any reason ever before. I felt drained after seeing it as if my brain had liquefied and blew my nose. And undoubtedly it is Donald Jones's worst movie. If you are thinking of renting it because of the redundancy of the Red Code DVD, do not bother My Grade: F
