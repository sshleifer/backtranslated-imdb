This guy has no cinematic idea. Okay, he seems to have made some interesting theatrical performances in his youth and about two acceptable films that have been successful for many political reasons have provoked that they fool communist censorship. Everything is very good, but look carefully: DO NOT KNOW YOUR WORK! The scenes are unbalanced, without a proper start and with a messy and emphatic content. He has nothing to say about this subject, so he takes over auctions with violence, emptiness and gutter language. How is it possible to keep such rotten corpse in life, who did not understand anything about cinema and art? Why did not they let him slip into pieces?
