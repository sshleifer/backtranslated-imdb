When I heard that Dukes of Hazzard would be remodeled with current actors and a solid script, I was like, "I'll give her a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what's going on." I saw what happened. I saw a big show at the end of the 70/80, which was a classic, virtually humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original these days. They seem to have a great show that had a big target audience and tried to "REMAKE" the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood ... NU ESTE WORKIN !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think he could have won a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is surely disappointed with the way he was portrayed and takes advantage of his character. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. How stupid can you be? A strange actor to play a wonderful Luca. That hurts me. I'll also give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her actor is clever. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, confident and a good girl from the south of the world. She was every model of small-growing girls growing up! (I owned the doll and the jeep - thank you very much!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, a 2-bit slut like Daisy Duke. Daisy has never been blonde. Why they had to throw it away. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great south emphasis, and she's great and would have done a great job. Anyway, I would like to say that this film has breathed something fierce. I feel like I kidnapped paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they should get my money back. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (original series) you do not see this movie. It will upset you. CMT (country music television) plays the Ducis again later in the night. Stay on the TIVO and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
