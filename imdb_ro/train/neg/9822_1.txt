There were times when I wanted to be beaten up to death. The only reason I endured the whole movie was that I could not believe how bad it really was and thought it had to improve. It was really a horror movie. I was terrified that I lost what seemed 4 hours of my life that I would never return. In the other two hours I mourned the loss. We recommend this movie to anyone you want to torture and tell them that suspense will kill them.
