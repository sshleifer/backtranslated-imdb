Somehow accidentally came to watch this movie. I'm not sure if I regret it or not. I felt I was watching the movie made by that group of students who did not do a lot of cuts. Every slang of Hollywood clich√© is played, while it whips us with the message, "Corporations are the final evil". Subtlety this movie does not know. As far as this happens, it even manages to offer its own spoilers. The story seems to be a fancy world of computer nerd come true. The main character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet she is a genius of programming and an apparent hacker (I think) among many other things you do not have to see. <br /> <br /> Also, I should have known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be good advice. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend one, I'm afraid.
