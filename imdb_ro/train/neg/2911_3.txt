This film is overlapped, predictable, pretentious and empty at its core. The settings are true to the epoch, but they are self-conscious about their magnification by prolonged exposure. Things that persist over artifacts stop the action and worship almost as much as the naked dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking as Bruce Willis did in Hart's war. Tom, you can not put a character in the depth of your face simply by making your faces bare! The content did not justify Paul Newman's histrionic action. This is a duddy wrapped in an atomic bombcase.
