I have not seen many low budget films, I have to admit, but this is the worst movie ever, the main character the old man spoke, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word at every 5 seconds, the Old Year could work better. The story had the most terrible plot, and the army put what she thought was like an army and then went over the top, I just laughed at how bad it was and hoped it would lead to the real movie. I can not believe it was under 2 nights for rent at the blockbusters, instead of taking it for free and getting out of sight. I think there was another semi-decent actor than the woman, I think the only good thing with the budget was the make-up, but they show every important scene of the movie at the beginning of the music. Very terrible.
