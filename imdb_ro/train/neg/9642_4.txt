I could not believe that part of the horrible dialogue came out of people's mouth, and the end of the coils attached to the body of the film was a real hoot. And we'll take pictures of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree at the boot. A teleportation device powered by the psyche Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container into a desert underground laboratory. According to director Fred Olen Ray, these were remnants of Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film extra value beyond how cheap it would seem. Inside the container is a cat extraterrestrial (played by Ray's son) that begins to ruin people to death. It was fun enough to watch this tiny "creature" in a reptile black suit with what looks like big goose shells attached to it, running in the dark. We just got to see what stamp and wipe off on a poster of ET, which I thought hilarious. And then he showed a snake that also comes out of the container that crashes the death of William Fair, after the mini creature chews in Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A low budget cut on Alien, I think ... Everything ends suddenly, showing that they have left the film at the end of the year before the bloody bob to get the final credits. He talks about a lack of funding ... Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's comment that they were not sure whether Aldo Ray would have shot through and remember the lines. She just did. It's fun to look, I'll give you that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
