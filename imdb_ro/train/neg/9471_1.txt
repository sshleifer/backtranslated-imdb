Do not misunderstand me, I assumed that this movie would be bad, I did honestly, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I've seen it was that there was a bunch of girls (a different story for another time). When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two terrible types, there is terrible Freddy vs. Jason, where you and your friends stand up and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there's a movie like that. The Cat cat has not even created a temporary interest in me. As I looked at the first start, not only did I get bored, but I felt as if I had been in some way violated by the terribleness of that film. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I like a lot of work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / Whatevers have changed was that they refused to use any of the original (red, black, white) colors for any character, but for Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to surprise any original (and do not like to use this word, but fits) to the original. The book was like a colorful and delicious ice Sunday, and the film was as soft and difficult to swallow as sawdust. Avoid this as a leprosy prostitute.
