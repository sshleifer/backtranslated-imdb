I like Clash's music and I love Joe Strummer's music and The Mescaleros. I went to this film hoping to learn about the man behind the majority. But I left the theater not knowing much more about Joe than I did after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The film never really reaches the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect the little stuff they had, blurry videos, and interview some people about Joe Strummer at a campfire. It seems that most of them have known him very little or not, and that the director wanted them only in the film to have more stars saying: "Oh, it was an inspiration to all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (which apparently asked him to keep his pirate suit to benefit from his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director could not wait until the body was cold before jumping to sell his version of "the biggest punk rocker and hippie to the heart" that ever lived, sanctifying the person without knowing enough about him. > <br /> Of course, being a fan, I enjoyed seeing the band's pictures, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs and the other, but in the end I felt like staying as Joe Strummer's portrait could be easy said in 60-90 minutes. Go to see the movie if you are a fan or otherwise listen to music from Clash or even better Mescaleros, where it's no longer worthwhile, where Joe Strummer has reached the peak of his musical development before his death, melting all influences rich together into amazing sound.
