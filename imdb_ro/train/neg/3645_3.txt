A young man gets a bad day of hair, comes out on a hill and falls where he can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" type 2,000 years ago, being his best friend, and an arnold Schwarzenegger look and sound. Herculean force helps the boy to be no longer in danger, and later to adapt to modern life. So, what's the big thing? This is the strangest idea for a family trip! Anyway, it should not have been tried at all, indeed! Our fictitious character of power and arm is nothing but a typical alien that seems normal to the rest of the universe. To add to blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing, and before you know there are some attempts of violence that do not qualify this as "family" entertainment. The scene in which Atlas complains about his underground is, however, strange. Just spend a nice and quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
