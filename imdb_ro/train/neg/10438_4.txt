the movie was aspired, it was not funny, it was not interesting. they tried to do so bad that it would be good, but it did not succeed. and thinking it great to like this movie along with hype are the only reasons why this movie is a success ... that at this time 50% voted 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty interesting to me , or the movie that goes public is crazy or this vote is unrealistic, which can have many causes and should be treated. anyway, it's a smaller film than the media that blossomed through mouth-to-mouth advertising. Success can only be described as a marketing marvel.
