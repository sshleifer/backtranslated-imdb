I just saw this movie yesterday. My friend wanted to see her only because of Richard Gere. I feel I wasted my time and money and told my friend that it was the last time we went to see a movie just because there was a certain actor / actress in it. I hope he learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in the chair. From me, since I've already paid, I wanted to see at least the end, only in the hope that something good would appear, but I did not breathe my breath, and fortunately, because I was a victim of the movie the same . <br /> <br /> It's not a black and white film, it's black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as those who record it, and all sex offenders are portrayed as basic unfaithful criminals, and the bad guys were really very bad. He's talking about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical US phobia. Richard Gere's actress was as good as usual, but the blonde who was supposed to replace her was in the best case. Totally unconvincing for this job. The film tries to exploit a popular theme and offers it a cheap, dramatic and sensational tower that is just unreal. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murder, vigilant beatings, rape and torture - something that seems almost free of charge. They even have a wolf attacking people in the movie - how low you can get. I gathered the movie will not come out in the US and will go directly to the DVD. That should have stayed in other countries, but because it was Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show them. Believe me, without Gere, the film does not even deserve a B-series movie.
