This show turned out to be a 30 minute loss of precious space on the hard disk DVR. I did not expect too much and I received less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, I can not believe Geico will ever try to use the cave ads campaign again. I would have preferred to spend a night when I checked my daughter's hair for the head lice than to look at this piece of refusal. I wonder what ABC has sent to make this show match the autumn calendar of '07, maybe a real hospital / crime / current show showing the AFLAC shelf? If I have not been able to express my opinion about this show, let me be clear and say it's not good.
