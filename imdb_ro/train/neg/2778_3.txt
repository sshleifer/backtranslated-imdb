This movie seemed to have everything for him with a good camera, sound, movie, sets, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it was his bad act or just a bad scenario, but he would say both. Since I poured him into this role, it was hard for him to change his mind to the end. I wish I had died in battle or in one of the sword / knife shields. Then the plot for the plot to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner and sex with the Queen? Pretty lame. And get to the extreme to kill her son? And then push her boyfriend like king? I see a wire or two here and there of historical bytes, but the way this was presented was farcical. I do not recognize Gary Stretch of anything else, but it was terrible. I read other users' comments on the fact that the sound was doubled, but I do not think he was called ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was terrible. The lines were read from the coroner table ... straight line. Perhaps he does not have the voice to wear fluctuations of tuna. Besides, I've seen it all the way, so the movie had at least one "interest." It could have been more if the script / lines and casting had more work to do. The scenery and crew together with the high-quality film is what made this movie above all. The film and the story were secondary. I give the movie crew a 10.
