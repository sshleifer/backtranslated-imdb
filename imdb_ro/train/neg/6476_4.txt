I had so great hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. It seems, however, that Disney is trying to perfect the art of continuing to play continuously on DVD. They deserve a blast. More, in fact. I thought the idea was worth it, but the music was absolutely awful and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in their movies. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and Beast, King of the Lion ... even Hercules and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. They've done so many great movies over the years that it's very sad they've sunk to the point of making sequels that are not quite good enough to put in cinemas. I hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for Walt Disney Corporation.
