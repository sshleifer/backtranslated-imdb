Writer / director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a movie box, which he says was misspelled by NASA. It says the astronauts who falsify the television images of their trip to the Moon by using room tricks. Astronauts were always in orbit on Earth, and on-site editors compiled this recording in just a few seconds of finished film. Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so unclear that he does not realize that the "behind-the-scenes" movie is indeed largely taken from the live 30-minute (also on the drum) live telecast, which was seen by million and not hidden in NASA's safes as they suggest. And we have to ask why Sibrel makes his own conspiratorial story about the sound of astronauts in the movie, because the astronauts' hearing in their own words makes it clear that the astronauts just tested the room without claiming the images. Ultimately, anyone can see the raw material for themselves without having to buy the Sibrel version, hacked-up. (He shows you more about the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination than about the "smoking gun"). Sibrel thinks he's the only one who saw him. What's more interesting are the clips in those rough images that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those that clearly show that the distant Earth is eclipsed by window frames and so on, destroying their claim that silk and transparent transparencies were placed in the spaceships of the spacecraft creating the illusion of a distant Earth. As in most of these films, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert, misleading comment and selective quote to manipulate the viewer in accepting a conclusion for which there is no real evidence.
