What's up there in the sky? Is it a plane? Is Superman? Errr, right? Is it a TURTLE!?! See, this is from the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other problems! The Americans throw a Russian warplane somewhere across Artic and the further explosions will thaw and they will literally awaken the giant prehistoric creature of turtles called Gammera. He / she is not very friendly, because it promptly destroys everything and everyone in his path. Governments that ultimately oppose to kill the nasty bastard with a new and super-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in the store? The turtle can fly! The first time this happens, it results in an extremely grotesque and hilarious succession! Gammer is on his back, bending over, when sudden fire blows out of his trees and rises up in the air. How do you not like that? Then there's a terrible plot about an annoying child able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but that's not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people! There is nothing else to write about this Japanese (and American re-edited) Sci-Fi effort, except that it is an obvious and utterly shameful ride by some classics like Godzilla and the original Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and designs of monsters are extremely hokey and, unlike the films mentioned above, they never manage to create an apocalyptic ambience. Relevant actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem not to know which movies are on them, and even the original Japanese scenes of chaos are not very convincing. Gammer's very own and personalized theme-song is quite cool, though, so it becomes an extra point for that.
