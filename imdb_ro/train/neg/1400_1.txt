God ... I thought CBS television programs were the worst things Gerald McRaney had in ... Four people are experimenting with insane mind control <br /> <br /> The computer . That's it, do not rent it. I've seen this under one of her many titles - "Gray Matter", and maybe it's one of the most serious movies of recent memory. The other reviews are right, it's terrible. You've never had so many to set up the screenshots, NEVER. The cast is terrible, the direction is awful, and the script is terrible. I can not emphasize how terrible this is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you were the variant. <br /> <br /> This is rated (PG) for physical violence, gun violence, mild gore, some profanities, and some adult situations
