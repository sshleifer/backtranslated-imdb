In Phantasm's Third Entrance, Mike and Reggie continue to chase Tall Man, assisted by a happy 9-year-old, a black GI. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (died in the Original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, because the gore and black comedy is much less inspiring and interesting, as it was in Phantasm II. I felt the stress was only on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a standing comedian. The humor of the previous movie was much drier and more oppressed, which fits a better story. Also, the settings are not as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the high man (Agnus Schrim) is not as obvious? There is still a lot of gore, but not half as much as this time. By the way, beware of the seriously cut version because it shows the most delicate off-screen crimes. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes so far, with the fifth being in production. The first one is a classic semi-cult, the second is a feast of horror and violence, and the rest can be easily jumped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, even if James LeGros presented his character much better in Phantasm II.
