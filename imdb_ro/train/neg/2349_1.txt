It was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately, it was not. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of the actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisms Biko has. Attenborough, big crowd scenes are ridiculous. The Soweto Massacre was not so, three narrow lines of the children (some making cartridges!) Merrying happily in the soldiers' arms. With Biko dead, the film quickly descends into the farce. If the fight against Apartheid was something, it was a struggle of the black people, but somehow we should all be caught by the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he was the first to say that Biko was important while he was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and apparently does not know he is in South Africa at all. not at all. The Dog family has more lines than black maids. As the family gets rid of a woman with whom I saw the movie - among other things, about a dozen blacks in a big and full cinema - whispered "It's like the sound of music." She had a point. Generally, this is a film by a white, well-intentioned liberal, if not in a radical struggle of the black people. And indeed, South Africa needs well-intentioned white liberals as she needs a hole in her head.
