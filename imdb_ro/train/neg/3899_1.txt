Where do I start? As far as the title of this film is concerned, I expected a certain degree of authenticity, and finally I was disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or Lili Marlene, rather a Hollywood story (or choose your movie) based on real characters. I should have had an idea when I heard a heavy English accent that gave the film to German; red blood text (title, artists) should have been the second hint. The story line is invented (Lale was not deceived from Switzerland by Rolf Liebermann's parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside the control of the NS regime, not while under control, played the station was taken from Vienna while a lieutenant was there on vacation, etc.) the costumes are poor and incorrect for time (the SS SS blacks used whenever from border guards to staff posts, they have disappeared from daily use with the start of the war, etc.), the characters are stereo (SA groping in a club once they were essentially out of power). Do not waste time.
