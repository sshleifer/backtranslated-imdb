Jack Black is an annoying character. This is a indie indie film for the age of 14.I need to write another eight lines? Ana de la Reguera is very good to look, like a Mexican nun who deals with the relationships and bad projections of Jack Black. This film is a PG 13 version of an indie film. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores profound Mexican culture. I suffer in his cultural horror: Jack Black is so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary in Mexican culture, as it was. The struggle culture in Mexico is not the most diaphanous place, a type of white color, like me, it might be looking for. I suspect Mexico is more opaque beyond Jack Black here. I think IMDb has changed my review. Has anyone changed?
