I entered this movie with expectations, from the hype, that it would be insightful and uplifting. Definitely more than a cheap promotion for Wilco. Instead, we receive a lot of moping and whining about the "process," a dishonest and undoubtedly unilateral portrayal of members of a band that was kicked out by the first donor singer / songwriter, an intellectual confession by his fallen friend - about 18 years old - saying that "friendship has unfolded" and this distrustful story, label label "hurt their feelings" by putting them in the fight, just so that the band can immediately receive 50 offers from other labels (oh, tension ... no!) They tried everything they could. I suspect that all the smoke and mirrors generated a tragedy that did not exist. This does not even take into account the lengths of many of the newest songs that have pushed us entirely, without a story, a prospect or even a decent cinema job. Tense attempts at emotional sincerity or a reasonable outlook on life made me sick to look. From the movie, this tape sounds like a bunch of drunks who live to find a voice they do not have, and I think they're kind of guards for the art of music, which certainly are not. And I thought the music sucked, and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the lead singer's style. I'll give him 2/10.
