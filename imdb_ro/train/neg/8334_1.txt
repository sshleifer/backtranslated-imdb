It has the worst absolute performance of Robert Duval, which sounds like William Buckley throughout the movie. His melodramatic actor, disordered, removes any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate thunderstorm or unintentional storm, but it's the only thing I can remember from a really ugly film. This image should be shown in every class of amateur actors, from an example of why you do not. Thank God, Duvall continued with bigger and better things and stopped trying to achieve a cultivated accent. He's a good character actor, but that's about him. Klaus is much better. Its performance is feeble and noteworthy.
