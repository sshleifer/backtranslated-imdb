I just rented this today ... they heard a lot of good reviews beforehand. WOW !! What a bunch of steaming in this movie is! Does anyone know the address of the director, so can I get five dollars back ???? Eventually, someone hit "Stop-loss" from "The Worst War of War in Iraq." To be fair, I do not think there are good war films in Iraq, anyway, but this was REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> I will not enter any technical inaccuracy, there are a hundred comments from other GWOT veterans detailing them all. If the director has bothered to consult even the lowest E-nothing about technical accuracy, he could have made the film realistic ... maybe. I think the writer should get the "credit" for this film loss. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this film from a certain living imagination that was not affected by the limitations of reality. Anyone wonders, except me, what was the purpose of this movie? Was that a message? Really though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am quite amazed by all the positive reviews really. This movie is hard to follow as a veterinarian because of all the wrong inaccuracies, but even if it could overlook this, the plot is smart, the characters are superficial (at least) and the act is the weakest. It's ironic, I suppose the movie should be about eliminating the Blasting Ordinance because it's the biggest bomb we've seen this year.
