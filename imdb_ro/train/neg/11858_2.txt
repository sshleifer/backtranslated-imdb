I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I hit by cable - is absolutely amazing. I see that the screenwriter and the director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check their worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. The golden serpent was, in principle, the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all these talents that work. Given how expensive it is to shoot in New York these days, I have to wonder how this was done first. And if you ask why I did not see it at all, she appeared after a movie I like on the cable and I left it while working on my computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
