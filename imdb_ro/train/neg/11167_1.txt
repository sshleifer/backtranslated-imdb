Jack Black can usually make me move by breathing, but in this movie ... Besides direction, writing, lack of plot, constant overturning (assisted and backed by steady photos directly from the camera) and a hunting average of .050, was still a total waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential has been there is scattered with a total lack of comedy and the worst direction I've seen in this part of the tube. I have heard that this film was portrayed by the Mexicans very negatively. While it is undoubtedly true, I really do not think this movie is meant to be racist. I think this is more the result of a "creative" team that is desperately trying to find something fun in this mess. You almost heard how they shouted behind the room: "Hey, look, it's a nasty Mexican! Laugh, people, please, for the love of all tenacious things, LAUGH!" But racism raises the taxes aside. When you get to it, it's someone who has cut down enough money and time to watch this bunch of remaining refreshing grains that should be offended, IMO.
