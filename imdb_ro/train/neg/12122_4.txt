Seeing the finals of the World Snooker Championship ended in a premature and disappointing manner, Ronnie O'Sullivan defeating Greame Dott with 18 cadres at 8 BBC 2, found a goal in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a movie which I absolutely did not lose my knowledge I lost a few seconds of the credits for the title, so she had no idea that Viggo Mortensen played in it and thought it could be a cheap TVM, certainly opening with Pearl and Marty children at a summer camp have that form of television, although the bright (too lighted) film seemed to suggest that it was a cinematic film and it was not until Viggo Mortensen appeared as a hippy Walker I realized was a cinematic release, after someone in Mortensen's status did not play in a TVM, I mean, it's like a legend like Robert DeNiro who appears in a movie direct to the film. Wait a minute, was not Bob ....? Some people on this site mentioned that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing couple on the screen and agree. I understand why Pearl was attracted to an interesting hippy guy, but he has no idea why Walker would have attracted Pearl's pure wife. Sixty years ago it was before my time, but surely if you have a choice between hippy chickens and bored homewives, it's not a choice at all. You think a lot of people took LSD in those days, so I think that explains this. I feel that the big problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes in front of being a romantic drama to the heart that you would expect in a TVM), with several scenes creating the coming of age scenes, why to include a scene sex quite explicit? It is jar with the rest of the film and is possibly out of place to menopausal women that were something in 1969. I say probably that the film also seems to target a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes, and those teenagers will probably be bored by the historical and social context of the man walking on the Moon and Woodstock. In other words, A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract more audiences but probably will not appeal to any of them
