Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable between them. This is the case with Melinda and Melinda, where all the characters talk to Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that can not be told to anyone outside a four-block radius in which Allen lives. They also share the same curiosity to be able to afford a multi-million-dollar Manhattan apartment, which seems to have been designed by professional decorators, regardless of their financial situation or what they are doing for a lifetime. the character that exists outside of this dense mentality is Will Ferrel as a binding Woody Allen surrogate. Although he does not just feel like making an impression from Woody Allen (such as Kenneth Branagh in the famous Celebrity god), Ferrel does not have the charm or charisma real Woody played when he played the best movies. The end result is another of a series of indulgent self-burial pits from a great old director who has dealt with his old reputation for years.
