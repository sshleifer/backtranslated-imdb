To be completely honest, I have not seen many Western films, but I've seen enough things to know what's good. This is by far the worst western planet on the planet today. First there are black people in the wild west? Come on! Whoever ever thought this movie could be a cool movie that everyone would love was easy, not not, completely retarded! Secondly, on that day, women especially black women were not prone to be wearing or using weapons. Asian chick talking perfect English? If the setting is Western, Asia is not where you go. Finally, the gay bad chick was too much the movie was just shit from the beginning. Now you do not get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so you did not check after reading this movie, this movie is the worst show of the black men I've ever seen!
