Actually, I did not bother with the Geico ads in the first 50 times I saw them and even found them to be a bit bitky and funny, but seriously! Is this the best thing these people could do? This show is shit! It is met and feels like watching an episode of the "Bureau" with characters disguised as petitioners (I know many of you would hate me saying this, but "Bureau" does not do it for me). Okay, I understand: we have poor slob, just trying to keep his nose clean and having a bloody boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really only has a mind that works only; and the dopey who just wants to be accepted, but SO SO! I worked with these people and found them as annoying in real life as I did on TV ... why would I want to lose another 1 / 336th of my week following more than those nominated? Please call your parents and ask them if they left you on your head, if after you've been thinking about it, you still do not think it's entertainment.
