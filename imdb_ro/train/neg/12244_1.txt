This movie is terrible. CGI is CGI gray blob very cheap. The crocodile looks like a big gray dirt. The worst thing is that no effort is made to make it go or to seem alive. It's mostly a CGI photographed in the store that is placed in scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of very bad movies with the Sci-Fi Channel. Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, it is composed of typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters / Waiters at local tables while waiting for Big Breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys tries to attack Kate, and the giant crocodile rises straight out of the water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the evil guy Kate and instead of collapsing straight down through the building (and crush Kate), the Croc just flies back at the same angle in the water. No law of physics can apply to this film or its special effects. At least there is an honor among the crocodiles.
