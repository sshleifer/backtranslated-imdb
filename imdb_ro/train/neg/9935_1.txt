He completely defeats why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is an extraordinary example of both his inertitude, both director and intellectual "polemic". It is hard to believe that Godard actually believed everything that was Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half the brain could go to the bankruptcy of those "isms" and how many people they destroyed and still destroyed, even though Godard made their films support them. As a director, ask yourself: you have black voices reading your political boring at your audience, and then, when you can not think of anything else to do, put another voice on the first voice, who lost their listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Genius, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a movie with Rolling Stones: of course, he did; it is not like that? It was the only guarantee to see such mindless garbage: the Stones genius eclipsing a political idiot deprived of talent and stutter, released with a room. The bookstore scene was not worthy of the worst edge theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence of even the little children who were accustomed to playing in it - as it could easily be seen. Abandoning, allowing friendly criticism to claim that all this stupidity was a satire in the main movie, is just a safe release to give those who clearly see Godard's poverty an intellect and an arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironically, Godard's great friend, Truffaut, along with Nuit Americain, made the best movie ever and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! Besides, Godard did not choose the song "Stones" about Sympathy with the Devil. It just happened to be the piece they were working on when "the movie" started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
