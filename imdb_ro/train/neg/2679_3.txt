(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the free term) that I have been trying to pursue for more than a year. I finally came to an end and now I wish I did not make repeated efforts. In an effort to save two hours of your life, I'll tell you that he plotted - a guy who has the ability to project a long blade in his arm to come home to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten by an old friend's mafia friend. He avenges the guy when he brings his girl home. Mafia's mother boys send men to revenge as police officers try to look for him. Very little is said. no explanation is given by anything (for example, why blocking girlfriend id in a nursing home), and the action, for the most part, is still on the screen. The film consists essentially of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody searching intensely and without saying anything, killing people (out of the screen - most of the action is on screen). He looked good, he was well acting, and there was some form of reason for what was happening on him could have been a good movie. Fuck, I would have liked a sense of real character development or a back story (all we know is that the guy was chosen as a child). The movie runs for over two hours and feels like the six. If they do not want to tell us anything, they could at least take the rhythm, so they seemed to move too fast. No, instead, we get the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero showing disturbed. He was with his face. He really annoyed me since I think it could have been a good movie if he had done something or someone would have said something significant, other than giving instructions to "get that guy." 4 out of 10. About four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never come back again. Only for those who want to see a Russian action movie, with very few actions
