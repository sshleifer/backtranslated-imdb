This is a terrible movie "B". It is mindless and often embarrassing. Plot, the basic routine "doing in the show business" is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups since 1942, including Brothers Mills, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group approaches the three-minute standard, except for the Brothers Mills, which, for some reason, justify two numbers. Ann Miller does not get to dance until the last few minutes of the film and has little to do but to ruin things in the middle of a patriotic propaganda barrage. The most exciting moment in the film, in my opinion, took place in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to play in a train, standing in awkward positions. (In the South of the Deep, the band was seperated in wagons when traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen alongside Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance climbs up the aisle to the room and makes a "Uncle Tom", biting his eyes and tipping his head like Willy Best did in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is really sad. Some movies go best.
