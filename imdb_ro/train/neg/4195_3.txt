Given the people involved, it's hard to see why this movie should be so confused and boring. Writer David Ward wrote two years later the amazing film "Capture," Jane Fonda has just won an Oscar for Klute, and Donald Sutherland has done excellent work in films such as "Klute", "Start the Revolution Without Eu" and "Kelly's Heroes." Plotwise, the film is a story of a coward, with a tiny band of villains struggling to plan a heist big. At the same time, the film wants to be hip satire, a series of comedy sketches such as the one that NBC television "Saturday Night" will do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the pieces of comedy look weird and forcible, and the broken comedy bits destroy any suspense that the heist may have. It is quite literally a film that continues to break itself, just as machines in demolition cars meet each other. The only real interest in me was watching Jane Fonda. "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a light version of the dramatic character of prostitute Bree Daniels in "Klute". However, you do not believe it for a moment. It's always Jane Fonda pretending she's a prostitute we're following. It's just as terrible a show that her performance in "Klute" was great. It would be a good lesson for teachers who act to lead the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that actors are as good as their writers and directors.
