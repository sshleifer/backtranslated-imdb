I just looked at the first 30 minutes of this, and what I saw was a total piece of nonsense. The scenes I've seen were as bad as Ed Wood. No, it was a hundred times LIGHT. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever, but this is not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the greatest director ever. American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was an office in a warehouse with the sign "Police Station" hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the pests clearly lose about TEN Feet. This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and takes them to a warehouse. He tells his policeman to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse wearing a duffel bag. The cop's partner thinks something is wrong, that his partner might be a bad cop who kills these women, but he's not sure if that's because it's terrible! The dialogue is absolutely stupid, the act is terrible, and the characters behave in the stupidest way I've ever seen on the screen. It is absolutely obvious to the policeman's partner that he illegally abducts these women and that he bore them and takes them to a warehouse and returns to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all the time, knows what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It has to be one of the best movies I've begun to watch and I will not waste time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely MARE.
