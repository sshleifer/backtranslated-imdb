I, how the powerful ones fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason alone: ​​falling into logic. It looks like one of those films that would have been easy with all its holes of plotting if it was out in the '80s and' 90s, but in 2008 looks really stupid. This is the most terrible thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. Details about the story Della (Kim Basinger) just picked up the gift in a mall and was harassed by a bunch of criminals who ended up killing a policeman who came to help. Since then, she is being watched by these idiot drunks through an abandoned street, and she escapes them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said, this film greets logic every step, and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the act is bad for television. Damn it, this pseudo thriller is bad for TV. How do you kill each of these correct political battles (1 Caucasian, 1 city, 1 Asian and 1 African American, all coming together to trample a Caucasian woman. Do not you love the Americans?) He's ridiculing a mistake. The way he killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The main head sex scene was so out in the left field that it makes you shake your head in shame. I recommend it to lovers of bad movies and no one else. Anybody else's Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this movie. Do not you want to see an actress you respect in such a bad movie now? Of course not. You were warned.
