I would love to be known, not to film films under 5 years of age. I was initially very excited to see this movie. His many trailer hits on TV for several months make me REAYLY want to see this movie. So last night, when I saw it was available at FearNet on Demand, I took some popcorn and sat down watching the movie. The story seemed quite interesting - some typically slaughtered people who did not ask for the subway. There is a photographer obsessed with missing people. Where is he going? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a link between some of the photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around yada yada. The movie had a way to suck you, though the story was extremely predictable. "Oh, no, it's dark, look behind you," I say, quite bored with cheap emotions. Crying, even if predictable, was interesting ... that is, to the end. "It was good to the end .... It then became stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I totally agree. And here come spoilers ... I was hoping he was a crazy killer, a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. Not. It was a secret society that kept living alive over the centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You had amazing movies, but that sank.
