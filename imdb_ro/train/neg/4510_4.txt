I like the memories of a geese, so I read the book twice; is one of the best books I've read last year. We were looking forward to the movie and feared that reading the book would destroy the film's pleasure. I did not expect the movie to be so bad. The best part of the book was omitted from the film and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) being the worst. If I did not read the book, this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The draft plan of the film says that "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she has overtaken her fishing ..." Has anyone seen how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Watch the movie and read the book.
