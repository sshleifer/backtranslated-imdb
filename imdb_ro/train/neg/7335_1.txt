This is probably the worst version of the play we've seen on the scene several times, except for the movie. A very nice idea for setting up - South American can give a credible backdrop for Hero's extreme round reaction supposedly contravene. But execution! Widdoes is a very fashionable Beatrice that gives a particularly low performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is not much better than Benedict. The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - making Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to turn it into a caricature along the lines of the villain who binds the pig of the railroad matches the goats at Dogberry's feet and his men - but the action makes you want to stop. <br /> <> The successful settings include the scene in which Benedict is bored to believe that Beatrice loves him - if competent, he would be gorgeous. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict's approach are well produced. Generally, I had to force myself to look, but certainly did not keep my attention. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. As for the last comments above, I'm almost 40 years old. I watched Shakespeare's scene and screen productions for over two decades. Maybe I suggest you when I try to protect your friends from talking with the play, rather than attacking other commentators when you are so armed in terms. But I can assume that because of your discomfort in terms of youth, you are of sufficient age if the way to act earlier days is more to your liking. I like my favorite character was Rylance and McTeer on the London scene. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can act.
