how can you take seriously the story of the bounty hunter, who lives hard, violent, with that accent? It's absurd. Besides, the visual style of the directer is wrong and gimmick, the plot is a gangster, superficial, boring, confused film, and the act is not convincing. The movie introduces new characters throughout the movie and is told in fragmented flashback - most of the sequence - apparently just to keep you beautiful and confusing. The movie ever shows you things that do not really happen, and then later says that "it really did not happen, that's what happened" - see the (apparent) killing of "first ladies" (false). What did I see for the first time, a wrong sequence of events? Then, the terrible casting choice, a complicated, disorderly plot, and a directorial style that causes headaches. 1/5.
