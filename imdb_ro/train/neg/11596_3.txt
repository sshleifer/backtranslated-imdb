"The Dreamy Child" in 1989 is the fifth film of the Nightmare series (generally overestimated), and at the latest from this point the series became total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's original version in 1984, and the third, The Warriors of Dream in 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring and was the fourth part in which Mad Crazy Freddy Krueger is bothering with idiotic jokes. This fifth series entry has nothing to recommend, except for visuals (great admiration) and a grisly scene, a retrospective of how Freddy Krueger appeared. The rest of the film is made up of the shrieking maniac, shouting stupid tools, and the old formula of a group of adolescent cocks who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because the old Freddy is waiting for them in dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a lot of uninteresting nonsense, such as a super-dumb "rhyme" of children, adds no reason except to have some kind of justification to make this continuation unnecessary and boring. In short: no originality, just a reduction of the old formulation and an overload of annoying painful jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals and, in particular, to emphasize the difference to the next, Dead Freddy's, which is terrible beyond belief. If you are not a hardcore enthusiast Freddy Krueger, "Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if you are, it is more than likely to disappoint.
