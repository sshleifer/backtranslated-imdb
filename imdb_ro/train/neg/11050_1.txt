Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost either through terrible writing or lethargic. That damn robot ... must be a jazz dancer? Also, one of the most serious sound tracks I've heard (monologues usually drowned through music). And ... where did they make the props? This ship looks like a box of milk ... We made better special effects at 8mm at the age of 13! I would recommend any movie student I should watch this movie (5 minutes at a time) so to learn how NOT to produce a movie. Or ... was the publisher guilty? It's really too bad, because the script was actually a good concept ... very badly executed all the way. I'm sorry for Malcom, you should have sent a double stunt. You're a good actor for such a bomb.
