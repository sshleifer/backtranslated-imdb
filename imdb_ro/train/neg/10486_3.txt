My main comment on this movie is how did Zwick get credible actors to work on this film? Impressive cast? even for the supporting characters, none of which really helps this movie. Do I have to admit that Tom Hank's cam almost deserved? what was it about Tom? Did you miss a bet? The best scene of the movie was Joe Isuzu - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's person, who is struggling with being a pink lady, is headed for the Vegas motel by the motel that runs down the gorgeous pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character heads to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit sooner to be the wife motivated by. While both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis' impresors, who are on their way to a Elvis convention that is being unleashed in Vegas. Soon the FBI gets involved and begins to pursue what they think is a serial killer in the role of Elvis. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie was good. When you watch this movie, imagine you're back in the first class? when story lines and continuity are not really important. It's much more enjoyable to watch just Basinger looks beautiful in her Pink Lady costume rather than wonder why what she does does not really make sense. The movie tries hard but eventually falls in a very short time. Eventually, it's full of ideas that could have been theoretically funny, but in practice they were not that funny. It's not the worst, but you can feel like leaving the building when you watch this one ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
