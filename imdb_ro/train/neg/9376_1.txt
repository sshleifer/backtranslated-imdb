While watching this movie I got sick. I got up with Pippi and every time I was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden she looked at the old and had a good laugh. but this US version should be renamed and will not be displayed again. it's terrible from start to finish. how can they make it so bad? well I guess someone blame translation ha ha ha .. but I'm never close to Pippi. this movie was never seen again and was never sent to a show. burn the film and save the children. if you want to look at Pippi, then look at the original movie and laugh good. LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, I'm sorry that Tami Erin will never lift you to be Pippi. Oh yes ... read the explanation of "spoilers", "ruining" a surprise and robbing the spectator of the suspense and the pleasure of the film. "Well, I think the director stands for this ... you watch this movie at your own risk .. it's really a waste of time ...
