This movie is terrible. The script is bad, the script is mediocre, and even sexual scenes are worthless. The iron and intrigue of the original film are completely missing. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (to "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing for the beauty of the original movie. Greg Morrisey's character displays a facial expression throughout the movie. The twists and turns of the original plot are horrible here; few that exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, he continued with confidence in this sequel, but is not enough to offset the other shortcomings. The only circumstance where a "Basic Instinct 3" should be done would be whether Michael Douglas agrees to join the show.
