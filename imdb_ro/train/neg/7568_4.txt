Chan Wook Park is nothing but inventive. I am a CYBORG, but this is OK is fun filled with little technical flowers with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Trying to follow Marc Caro and Jeunet's footsteps, PARC embarks on a fantastic story with a light heart, which is a radical departure from its usual morbid rate. Almost one who should be accused of his ambition or vision, it is really unexpected to see that Park's effort is added so little. falls as it goes, although the final result is a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the gags are humorous and abundant humor abounds, but it still fails miserably to create any meaningful relationship with the public. Characters are nice and weird and play with the taste of distribution, but try as if I could, I could not take care of anyone. THE SIMPLE FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a mistake, probably indicating that the Park was a little overpowering, but still managed to present a single outbreak of the director and, after an impressive filmography, he was easily forgiven. None of the safe trust that ordered the JOINT SECURITY ZONE or sympathy for MR. VENGEANCE is obvious here. I'm a CYBORG, but that made me feel so impressed I got caught up in a quick instinctive ritual (more regularly as the movie progressed). I gave it to LADY 5/10, and by this measure it probably is not worth more than 3. For the old time, I will be generous: 4/10
