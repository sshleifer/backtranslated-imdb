Hamlet made one of the most boring MST3000 episodes ever. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not think he ever wanted to work at that slow and unclear pace. It is also one of the heaviest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. As I said it's pretty boring. It is in black and white, the pace of stimulation is slow and there are no minimal landscapes. The actors are also called, so they do not help. This is the only MST 3000 that I can not follow in one session because the guy who plays Hamlet says his lines can make someone sleep.
