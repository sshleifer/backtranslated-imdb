Think of this movie as a live action program on Saturday morning from now on. Even the little villains will find it hard to please, because they are running like molasses! I do not fully understand how terrible God is to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many war veteran movies have used the same old beach many times, but this is very rare, since it is attractive to loved ones. And who in the world would have let a first siren be thrown first? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another fine gem for the 1999 TV season!
