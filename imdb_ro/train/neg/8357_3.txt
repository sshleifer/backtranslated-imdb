Man! What a boring movie! But this is a guilty pleasure in my childhood, even if I do not like to admit it. They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right at the Cupertino border) we had this called the G Channel on our cable system. And, in fact, they have shown the same and always the same film. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in love and I loved the young Brooke Shields and loved adventures in the Canyon Sea in the 1940s. The scenario makes no sense, the direction is weak, a few important things are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance, a lot of dialogue that is so bad that it's good and a beautiful song Carole King has played over the final credits. Perhaps you have to be stoned to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everybody knows there's no gold in Grand Canyon!
