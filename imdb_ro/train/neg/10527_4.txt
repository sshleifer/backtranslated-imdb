I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP. And this is certainly a PPE. One year after The Exorcist, she returned to business with this film, but what we all were for Blair's career never broke, she never became a big star. This is one of the reasons why many of her films are PPE. It offers good performance in this movie. This is an unrecognizable rejection by parents and has no friends. Played at the age of 15 playing a 14-year-old girl, it's funny. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers if it sticks a silk queue to its virginity. In most editions is cut, why, I do not know, no blood is involved, well, Blair is the naked ass, but nothing is shown, not T & A anything to offend people. But the movie is slow, extremely slow. I do not normally enjoy myself, but I almost fell asleep. It's just about the fact that the age of 14 becomes a rebel against society, but no blood flows, no gore, nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder for me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it, otherwise leave it as it is.
