The shooting crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so it dominated the Israeli shootings. I was hit by the almost opposite points of my mother. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of extraordinary happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the possibility of a life of deprivation and despair. With such completely different views, any encounter did not have real chances of any encounter of mind. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for Israelis was security. With such an abyss, is it really a movie of its kind? I ended with the feeling that I saw unnecessary propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
