After I enjoyed Mike Myers' previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations for a bond spoof in the 1960s were quite high. After the first minute it became obvious that this was an exercise in which we were as few and unhappy. I'll stop in ten minutes. I saw her the second time to see if I was wrong for the first time. I stopped it after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe that a boy of about twelve could find this funny. Dialogue is a mbarrassment, Myers is painfully traceable (like Heather Graham), and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things even worse. Apart from the slightly funny title and the psychedelic set design, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this as the plague, though many of my friends enjoyed it (maybe they were eye-catching at the time).
