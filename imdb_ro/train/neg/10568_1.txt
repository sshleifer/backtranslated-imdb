Wow. I saw some very bad movies in my time, but that really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the last decade - without exaggeration. As a veteran of the US Army of the Afghan War, I realized it was almost impossible to finish even looking at this ridiculous film, not because it brought memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no an attempt to find "authenticity" anywhere in the movie. Not as much as the smallest pieces. It seemed to have been written by an 8-year-old who took all his notions of war (and military behavior) directly from comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can not fully explain the atrocious production values ​​of this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> We could try to list all the endless technical defects, but it would last forever. From the old shoulder units that have not been seen or worn since the Second World War, as well as the characters of the character's character, such as "ColCollins" (played by the Colonel Collins character), which was written in reality using the inverse "N" image in the Russian alphabet (not in the American alphabet) the continuous and continuous list. Uniforms, equipment, plot, and especially the behavior of the characters themselves - each scene was full of ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies, and mindless clichés. Neither the story itself nor the characters were credible or credible. Everything was laughing childhood, in the extreme. It was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal to pre-pubescent boys, and I have little doubt that they would find this absolutely absurd movie. In short, this film has absolutely no ransom of qualities at all. It's a total waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone to read this to pass this garbage; it is not worth wasting any moment of your time.
