Being an independent director and a great fan of Edward D. Wood Jr., I bought this documentary believing that this would finally make a record as a talented and brilliant Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> What I received was a disinterested, self-centered, conflicting, contradictory, self-conscious compilation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems that when there is new interest in Ed Wood, these people come out of the work of "Wood"! Only to take a spirited mood to someone who actually gave them a chance when no one else would be! After 50 years, I would suggest that many of these people should give up the fact that they have not received the $ 75 they promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative director who knew how to have fun. In fact, for whom he lived everything. You can chuckle when you see Ed's movies, but somehow you know you're laughing at him and not with him. <br /> <br /> But, I'm ... Back to the movie at your fingertips. If you are expecting a movie ABOUT Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about bitter old actors, this movie is for you!
