I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. The original sketch and the overturning of the plot were obvious and could have been guessed in advance, even years before modern detective performances today. But it was fun to see crazy sofa models and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, mandatory suburban humor who was having fun at the modern art of sale. The High Tech House is a version of Jetson's or Disney's Tomorrowland, and it's fun to think about the writers who invent those "gizmos." If they are outside, go to the game, because there are much better Columbo Episodes. However, we should be grateful for the cable television that these episodes are being broadcast.
