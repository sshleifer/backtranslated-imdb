This movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you had to keep track of it. My friend and I rented it, and I wasted two hours of the day. Now do not get me wrong, the act is good. Only the film as a whole has furiously both of us. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to rent something that was a bit easier. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. Her character seems to be manic and not everything. Darryl Hannah, though he has played for a long time, does a wonderful job playing the situation he is in. Several times I woke up crying on television telling her to fight or become violent. Very violent film ... not for the weak of the heart.
