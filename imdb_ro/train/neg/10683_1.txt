A guy gets killed. Beyond sight, this other guy shot him. He has some bodyguards and he gives the killer, but a reporter gets interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who was killed. A guard comes in and hurts, but he can not talk. I can not figure out why. It's not like someone else is interested. He's the only reporter out there. However, her publisher discourages her from working on this tortured story. But, hey, it does it anyway. She goes to see the sister and mother of the murderer. A few minutes after leaving, they have long died - somebody throws up their trailer - a big ball of fire. Then look out of the hospital bodyguard. He finds him in the boat, but a minute later, both underwater suck on a diving tank, because three guys try to scoff at them (and they threw a high-speed boat - a big ball of fire). The reporter and body guard shoot two of the guys trying to beat them. <br /> <br /> During the next hour, another guy gets killed by passing through the street, there is a fireball with more gutters in a warehouse, some car wrecks and death, a false suicide, etc. and so on Lots of stifles, all the massacres. <br /> <br /> Great stuff, but what the reporter and bodyguard can not imagine is why in hell the original man was hit. What is the motivation? Of course, it could help us figure out why the reporter is really interested. By almost all of this, he is the only reporter of the story. Nobody else in the media cares. Not even with all the big balls of fire and the bodies. True, the original guy who was hit was not just a celebrity. His job was pretty boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is an agent of the Secret Service. <br /> <br /> This is the spoiler? It should be. After all, there are no television cameras, no print reporters, no bloggers ... just one of those police blotters ... So what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme I think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! Spoilerul is that his wife did it! Yes ... First Lady. It was because the president was tricking. And she moves away from her. It's very sharp, right? But how the hell could anyone ever figure out? Why would anyone bother? After all, only one reporter is really interested. <br /> <br /> I gave this move a "1". It was so stupid I had to look. And it was great! This is the true spoiler! But even if I told you, you have to believe that!
