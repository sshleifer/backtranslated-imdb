I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. The act was terrible and ridiculous intrigue. The fact that the wife of the main character who left him triggered a mental defamation but became so silly and boring, after a while I could take care less of any of the characters. The film continues to go over and over the same ideas without anything new or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter came too long after Stuart began to open his wall to see what happened after the counter indicated there was something there. Then there were the repeating scenes with the flyer and the confused ones in which he meets. I should have guessed this movie was a flop when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do a favor when this movie comes, read a book! You will be better.
