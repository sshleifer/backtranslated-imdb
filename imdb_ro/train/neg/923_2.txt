For some reasons, various young couples walking through the Italian Alps parted to see who could first get to their camping. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an old demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the "Tyranus" spirit when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. Then he spends the rest of the movie running in the woods, hunting friends and shaking his limbs, to add to a stew to bring back the demoniac "Demonicus" back to life. This digital release of the Full Moon movie is stupid, meaningless, has a terrible effect and sound, and (Los) Angeles National Forest is a weak substitute for Italy. However, it is quite large on the unintentional laughter scale thanks mainly to the overworked lead performance. Whether the eyes of the elderly eyes run into the armor that looks cheap to beat a sword or to see the neurotic Latino wives about demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous expressions and Kenyon's quiet delivery must be seen to be believed. Well, at least it's not boring like most of the cast.
