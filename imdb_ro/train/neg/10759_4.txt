Despite the great touches of the future design, Asimov's intelligent premise and Will Smith's trusted performance, this film does not meet the expectations. The pans come thick and fast; (the awakening from a recurring nightmare, the Maverick policeman has the badge revoked by the hardass lieutenant, to list more - he can see the end at a mile down). This movie is also a scenario - you never feel you have traveled anywhere; what should have been a world disaster never leaves a CGI, of course, Chicago. Robots themselves are good in detail, but the "crowd" scenes look bad Disney - CGI is overloaded again and again. And if you can destroy robots by destroying them, why do they need to inject "nanites"? You know it's a duff movie when silly questions like this start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly because of the predictable total plot that could have come from any action movie of the last forty years.
