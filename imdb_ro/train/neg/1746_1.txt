Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen. Very small character development. Be stupid and useless. The entire movie was chaotic and less directed. There was no proper conclusion of the story. The airport was filmed in a mall. <br /> <br /> The same story chewed again until you wanted to say "Please, just get through with it!" Even singing and dancing were useless and badly choreographed. The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot spots all around ... but then most of Bollywood movies are that anyway these days. <br /> <br /> Btw are not from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
