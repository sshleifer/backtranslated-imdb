I'm sure there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes the movies that MST3K enjoyed. After seeing this and the Werewolf, and reading dozens of comments about how stray I am, I have become convinced that there is some conviction. Many people say people who hate her "are just afraid of gore," "I do not know good horror," or stuff like that. Well, I do not care about gore, but I want something to happen in a movie! The bulk is just the wife sitting and looking around! Or go around the house / garden! A movie requires something to give it an atmosphere, you do not get it unless you have unnecessary scenes if someone walks and looks. Oh, and "Makes you believe"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever had the scene! <br /> <br /> Ps. For recording, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, stuff like that.
