My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: I thought it was very boring and I thought it was just a repetition of things from "101 Dalmatians." We did not wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits from the beginning - they were nice and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth watching. Thank you.
