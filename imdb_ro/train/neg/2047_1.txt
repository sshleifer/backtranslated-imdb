I do not want to get a shot here, but ... ... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than revengers. Incompetent direction, disjointed writing, and terrible action are the only lifelong coherent elements. Recorded on a very cheap film, it looks like a high school project, but without emotion. Illumination is often like a single sun-gun. The sound is a bit better than a small one on the camera, but all about it is just terrible. The plot is moving in strange directions, without foundation or resolution, techie elements are obviously absurd, and editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not really bad enough to be funny. They were. BTW, packaging is deliberately misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
