I've seen this movie a long time ago, and I have no desire to see it again. This movie is about Preston Waters, a lucky lucky cat who seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short in cash. All of this changes when a bank thief runs on Preston's bike and sends him a blank check for compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank thief who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says he works as assistant to a mysterious and wealthy supporter called Mr. Macintosh (named after the computer). After that, he just goes crazy with the money. On paper, this seems to be a great idea. However, on screen, it is one of the most empty movies I've ever seen. In fact, it's too incredible. I know certain parts of the movie were intended to be incredible, but I draw the line of a 12-year-old boy who comes out with a 30-year-old woman and is charged with a small imaginary fortune. It was also a superficial film with weak action, a predictable plot and characters that are less memorable. Characters were either cheesy, overhead, annoying, or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip it.
