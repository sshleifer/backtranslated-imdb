When I first heard about "Down To Earth," I was quite excited. I'm a big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma. But this movie turned out to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances, and the movie was very badly directed as a whole. First, Chris Rock. He interprets the whole movie as a comedy routine. Obviously, this works well in the scenes where it was supposed to make the stand, but in the rest of the movie, no. Even when he talks to another character, he seems to think he's trying to make a laugh. It has some funny moments, but they mostly come on stage (no wonder they decided to make their character a comic). As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty much there just to give someone Rock to talk with, none of them stands out. Also, the film was badly directed. The film has basically a plot with one joke: a white old guy who acts as a black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this could have worked and it was quite funny. The problem was that I saw too much of Rock and not too old old guy. It should be fun, because this white guy says Chris Rock jokes, but most of the time we see Chris Rock, so it's not that funny. Some scenes in which they decide to show us that the white guy who talks like Rock is actually hazli. If it had been shown more, the film would have been more fun. Generally, a few moments of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" is badly acting and badly straightened. This was a pretty disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rate: 4/10
