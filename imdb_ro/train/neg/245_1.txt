Beyond a shadow of doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, but it keeps a heart in my heart because the poverty of her special effects and a terrible sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that it's all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilarious side-division. <br /> <br /> The opening of the scene from "space" is almost as impassive as the cinema becomes, as bottles of washing liquid whistles alone with the dimmed dialogue. Before you had time to work if you guys who went crazy are credit rolls up and action fights for life. <br /> <br /> And besides the giant plasticine the two-headed snail that terrorizes our heroes, you also get double bonus extra to have both original actors voices and doubled voices at the same time. pure genius. <br /> <br /> The sad thing for fans of this type of fare is that I've ever seen only one copy so the chances of seeing them ever are unlikely. Perhaps I have my own copy of my own. <br /> <br />
