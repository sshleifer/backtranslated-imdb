After Chaplin made one of his best movies: Dough & Dynamite, he made one of the worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. In the first year in the films, Chaplin made about one-third of all his films. Many of them have been experimenting on ad-libbing, editing, gags, shooting sites, etc. It takes place on a path that Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with her boyfriend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of his friends and Mabel. Then he did Mabel in the tribune without real repercussions in his behavior. A lot of sequins here, but there is nothing else to recommend this movie to others than to watch Chaplin grow. The pattern I saw was badly damaged, which affected their joy. Charley Chase can be seen. * 4 stars.
