I have no idea what idiots gave this film a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! In fact, I watched it all because I could not believe anyone would make a movie so useless. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt to offer any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to miss 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure you bring something to blow up because cinema is simply someone running around with a portable camcorder and half the time on who can not see the main topics. This style has been used much more successfully in films like "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot or suspense to which style would borrow nothing. I should have known better when it appeared at 2 o'clock in the morning that it would be horrible.
