Franco Rossi, the six-hour mini-Italian series of Quo Vadis is a very curious beast, creating an absolutely convincing ancient world, shot in fact (very few long shots without big stamps), but playing drama so much in the favor of allusions to classical literature and history, that the story is constantly lost in the background. The structure of change (much of the episode is written by voice) and the lack of narrative urgency makes it a complete six-hour version that is both demanding and impatient, and of course too often unsettling, but has something to do. The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronius (a Frederic Forrest, who fortunately was called Frederic Forrest, whose voice almost lent his dialogue) is a man whose time spent so much in search of a brilliant angle to survive the life of the court that he has become incapable of experiencing emotions, and Klaus Maria Brandauer's only interpretation of Nero as an actor whose movement and action is calculated on how the "audience" will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow appears briefly in a few episodes, being rewarded with the most impressive and truly moving scene of this show where he meets a child while trying to leave Rome. It's a kind of thing that the show could do with more, but it seems too often to align every potentially emotional, inspiring or interesting moment in this extremely low direction. Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes an amazingly anonymous hero, mixing up with the walls and coming less like a Roman officer than that quiet, lightly but harmless guy who works in the same office like you who does not say too much at office parties - you know, the one you think is called Dave or something like that. The budget limits are very visible once Meet the Lions' time for Christians and the fight with Ursus with the bull is a key so decided to go over you before the show suddenly loses interest and ends abruptly. > I can not recommend a special trip, but if you are making a trip, you are not entirely without rewards.
