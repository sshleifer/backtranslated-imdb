** SPOILER CONTAINS ** Sean Young (who, in some scenes, with shaggy hair, looks something like Elizabeth Taylor), is striking in his opening moments in this movie. Standing behind a police car waiting to signal a bust, her face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, once the bust is over Young's tense behavior, it never changes. This is a fatally inhibited actress. One just has to compare Young with the performer playing his colleague and best friend, Arnetia Walker, to understand what's missing in Young. Walker is open, emotional and quiet at all times ... to the extent that there is no apparent barrier between what she feels and her expression. She is an open book. The young man, on the other hand, acts in the shy, self-conscious way his neighbor could expect if he was suddenly thrown into a movie. Practically, it has no clue. With this major goal in the center of the film, we are left to think about the misgivings of the story. For example, after Miss Young is kidnapped by the murderer she pursues and gets stuck in a closet, she breaks the door when she is left alone. She was dressed only in a bra and panties, but in a similar situation, with a psychopath who had to return at any moment, you would head to the door ... or take your time to pass through wardrobe, get some clothes and get dressed? I think this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions Miss Young's face, but Young can not convey this kind of complexity. There are a few moments that affect the film, such as short police interviews with the killer's past victims, but in general this is a targetless effort. It is very bad that Miss Young was replaced while filming pairs of comic films that could have exploited her limits with humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), because her starvation while trying to play real people is weird emotional. Watching Miss Young trying to act, at least in this "thriller," is a sad show.
