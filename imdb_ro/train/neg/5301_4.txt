I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans debut. And I also liked to see how it would do. I have to say it is excellent in its role. Divya Bharathi is gorgeous in this film. a wonderful thing.Susham Seth is doing well.Alok nath was good in his role.Amrish and Mohnish made their songs too well.Dalip was also good in his little role.Actors shine in a Mediocre.Mai movie the direction is medium.Editation is poor.This story is boring. She tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer. She has a lot of female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and marry. Ravi gets killed by his cousins. Kaiajal becoems ​​a widow .. To get rid of Ravis cousins.They go to Bombay.She happens in Raja.She falls in love with him and gets married.Ravi is back.Report is predictable.The pollution is predictable.The first half bores. It also shoots much. But it is saved by actors and music. The second half is having fun. Music is appealing with some beautiful songs. Cinematography seems to be overtaken by the first half, but it seems unimaginative. Songs are boring, with the exception of "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. The pieces are outdated. Just like this watch for actors and music Rating-4 / 10
