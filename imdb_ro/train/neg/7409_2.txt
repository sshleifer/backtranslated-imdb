There are a few elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are shaded by a bad action, plot holes, deus ex machina thrown, silly dialogues, weak script and predictable cliches ... <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror film with a story that does not go anywhere most of the time. An unlikely group of heroes, including a black guy who first gets it (yes, that clich√© seems to still be alive even in Finland), seem to have trouble trying to get out of an empty mysterious hospital. There are striking ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought at least that they did not use the zombies, but they came), and Finnish glam rock with demonic makeup on their way. There is also a doodle with change over time, but it adds nothing to the story. The Austrian girl and a hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but never told their confused viewer or friends. Their lines consist only of profound thoughts of life lesson, such as: "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in the dark ..." or threatening "I need a red pencil ... a red pencil ". So all these characters (including the worried father and the sweet doctor in distress) end up running around them, on dark floors and from or erroneously to demons. Occasionally, there appears a ghost or a group of zombies, and if a keyboard demon does not seem to notice a group of six people heading for him, waving a flashlight and talking, he just pretends. And apparently this demon can break through the walls without much ease, but the opening of the elevator door is beyond its capabilities. Finally, we even get to a "sequence return". Or maybe it was not. Oh, boy I want this movie was, and like the one that makes time seem to move faster, so everything is playing in just 10 minutes ...
