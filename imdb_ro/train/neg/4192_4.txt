In this short an urban man and his wife have their strange lives laid out when the man takes to wear an old costume of his mother's red trousers in the law. I continued to follow this in the hope that I could see why it was done or why the other commentators found it funny. For me it was a total waste of time. Not everyone's tastes are the same, but that was not clearly for me.
