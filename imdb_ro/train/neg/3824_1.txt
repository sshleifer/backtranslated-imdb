I feel that the film did not represent Smith's history. The purpose of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that would be "comfortable" to the leaders of the LDS Church, historical precision seems to have been worrying. The film was designed to be a "promotion of faith" experience, not a balanced vision of Smith "as a man." I took it myself to study Smith's life and read both LDS papers and no LDS work. The film, like most of the LDS projects, was beautifully shot and was well acted. However, it was not a realistic representation of either the beginnings of morphism or the relatively short life of Smith. A significant amount of time was given to reactivate an accident Smith had when he was seven. Although this event was undoubtedly important in the formation of his mental conception, it seems that the main reason for his inclusion in the film is to help establish a sympathetic vision of Joseph Smith. Another point is to illustrate the adolescent years of Smith, the film being silent about the Smith family's involvement in magical practices in the 1820s. Another problem is while the film shows that Joseph Smith fits well in combat battles, fails to he shows how he sometimes lost temper and became violent. I can move on and on. This film was not history in any way and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any purpose other than entertainment.
