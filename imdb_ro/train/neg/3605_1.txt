the cover of the tape makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. Splatter University came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. is not that no plot for this movie, who the hell would ever produce this movie loss? <br /> <br /> Spoiler forward before the teacher dies in this, and it was a female, we all know we need to have a female surviver, if you break the rules, you do it in a shot of horror,
