This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All involved should be embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely terrible, and hokie does not begin to describe the performance of each actor in this movie. The plot is stealing a lot from the executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is the Academy Award. I've never been so disappointed when I watch a movie. Air Rage should be burned with ash stuck in a vault that will never see the light of day again. Anyone who saw her should shower and wash the horrible movie smell of them. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end, when the credits rolled. It was easily the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to the Law and Order, and the other people in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. Anyway, they should never try to be in a movie again.
