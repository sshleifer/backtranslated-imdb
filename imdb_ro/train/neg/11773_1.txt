I left some years of listening on these boards because of the lack of intelligence that is communicated through reviews that appear periodically on the IMDb space of this film. I saw this film with satisfaction from the Asian film festival in New York, which had a very good selection of films this year, see vital, the snake in June, CHA NO AJI, the survival style) and regretted each day as a scene from that movie disintegrates from the back of my mind and becomes a living memory. I'm sure you can read a laudatory summary of the movie on Subway Cinema, which is probably the reason I made the mistake of drawing my friend in the movie. The description was the sort of horror movie I had longed for for a while, based on pure terror, rather than on a cheap fear. P was different. It was based on cheap laughter. The annoying little kid described this movie as "the lesbian team to fight monsters." Completely untrue. There's a subplot built in this movie to make it look like the relationship between girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This movie seems like a short for "You're afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and has only been able to cause laughter and confusion on the part of the audience after eventually canceling their attempts to see this film with any appearance of seriousness and to try to forget the $ 9 they have wasted at the door. I almost want the spurrier paul to be in the audience so I can laugh at him and ask him why he has lost 5 years in Thailand to do a horror-cum-porn evil softcore that belongs to the spice channel that has she only managed to excommunicate her family, and caused a small move to the Belgian film festival. The only movement that caused this was a gurgle in the lower intestine, because it could not be extracted from the breast that it is. Anyway, I hope I can dissect anyone from making the serious mistake of seeing this movie, was really one of my first top 3 worst movies, destroying soulplane for number two.
