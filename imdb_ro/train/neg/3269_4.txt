With the exception of the act of Meryl Streep, which is remarkable as always, I would avoid this movie because it has a dated "Movie of the Week" quality about it. But it's worth watching if you keep a few minds in mind: How a couple can handle media control and how they are treated differently. Throughout the film the problem is the credibility of the different. Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) come to it automatically with a "strange" air of them. The couple involved is religious (different from the majority of culture) and Adventists (different). So, their lifestyle and mentality are likely to start with. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we have strange questions. Therefore, the true story is how society (and the world) treats the different, those with different accents, different beliefs than what we do and how we treat what they say as a suspect. It's difficult to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are humorous posts, unfortunately all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie it was discovered (as you will find in web searches) that much older children have been watched by dingos. Research by dingos experts has shown that not only is it possible, but most likely that the baby was taken by a dingos (perhaps a pair), easily extracted from clothing and eaten in moments without a trace. <br /> <br /> However, what is left behind is the question why people have defended themselves when they were found to be endangering their children rather than killing the dingo to save children , why because a woman's affection is so cold, she is supposed to be guilty on and on. <br /> <br /> Wondering questions, with or without a movie.
