This is an in-name sequel only for "A Christmas Story," titled "A Summer Story". Ralphie tells her family adventures during the summer when she moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Ranging, unfortunately, does not happen. The original worked because of his irrational nature and honesty - whoever might refer to it. This is simply bad and not very funny. Charles Grodin's last movie - no wonder! It is one of the poorest roles. I feel sorry for him. Mary Steenburgen has nothing to do, everything is formic, and you have to wonder why they even bothered. And I mean, come on a spinning competition? Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
