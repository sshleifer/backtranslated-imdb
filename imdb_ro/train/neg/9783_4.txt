Not the worst movie I've seen, but not too good. I myself am a paintball player, used to play a lot of aerobatics and pass from the forest to the air ball, is a pretty big change. The film features similar qualities. First of all, the movie begins with this team, which apparently tries to shoot this type of "Phantom" or something else, seems to be a professional team and wearing shirts and pulling mags, autocheers. A sporty guy. It's not too wrong with the movie, but more so as it was perceived to be very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are good boys are wooden players who do not seem to have much money and have dreams of getting "better weapons". Another team constantly takes them and insults them for playing the forest and bla bla bla The ghost helps these wooden children and instructs them, and it makes them play airballs and defeats virtually all teams including " professionals ". So what's wrong with the movie? Well, budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie is NOT bad, but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the act is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also quite bad. It seems to imply that everyone will go to speed and all the other shit. It was just a bad movie in my opinion and does not give a real perception what paintball is. To be true true paintball is not all that buddy is, a lot of cussing and bonus ball does not "respect" and rule rules. Do not watch this movie and then wait for a field to scream "4 is 1!"
