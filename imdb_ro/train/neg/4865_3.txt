I did not like this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in town, and I was spoiled talking about animal movies that are particularly well done in any way. The animals were not pleasant. They all irritated Chris Rock's guinea pig, but then what I was expecting is Chris Rock. I think I smiled once or twice on some nice lines, but that's it.
