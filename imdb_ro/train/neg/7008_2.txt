Annie Potts is the only highlight of this really boring film. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really angry that someone has stolen Corvette that he and his colleagues have turned into a hotrod (perhaps even the most ugly car he would have featured in a movie) and headed for Las Vegas and Annie the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy. I would have missed my eyes after watching this if it was not the fun to look at Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for Hamill to have not taken some lessons of action from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy como.
