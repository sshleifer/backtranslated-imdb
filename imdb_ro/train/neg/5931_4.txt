This movie should have been only 10 minutes. I mean, there is only 10 minutes worth of content that can be watched (even hesitant to say a movie). The opening credits of the film were somewhat promising. As the movie begins with short comments of man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more records of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's most famous songs. The length of the Cave show makes you more keen to see more about Cohen, whose wisdom and well-spoken words have already guessed you. But how Cave's performance is just the beginning of super-boring performances over time, literally a bunch of people who do not even have a minimal attraction to keep you up and running. What does the director really think? five minutes of close-up photos of wanting to be weighed in a fake concert in Australia! What the director really believes in insulting the audience by adding "false applause" to these endless performances. The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little about what you came to see. There is no single record of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of a few photos of her first days of singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes that Cohen talks to, it may not even be 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit-by-bit, between the disastrous activities of the cameras, which capture some of the most unattractive people screaming at Cohen's lyrics. If you've ever decided to lose money on this movie, NO! just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time.
