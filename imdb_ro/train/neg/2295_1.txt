Unnecessary, boring film, with the charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Launched for a minute on Thursday, perhaps in a local cinema and avoided by the entire Sydney population, except for me and four other people, BACK OF BEYOND is an apparently created project by a producer looking for a toll. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (Polson has turned into a director of thriller blades such as SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems to never get a guernsey out of roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's largest exports on the screen. Roles of this kind are major disappointments, and movies of this kind are just a waste of talent and time.
