Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing to spoil for this film. Even though B. Mattei never made any masterpiece, he used to do his job with some humor and madness, which made him a funny Eurotrash director. But in the last 10 years it seemed to have lost him. This movie is just empty, nothing will wake us up from the deep sleep you are in after the first 10 min. No sex, no blood (supposed to be about), no actors, no dialogues as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombie epics. So, rest in peace, Bruno, you will remain in our forever, anyway, thanks to such unforgettable stones as: Zombies 3, Robowar, Rats, alto inferno, Virus, cruel jaws and a few others. So if you do not want to see B Matta possessed by the new film of the spirit of jess Franco, Know this beautiful career of artisans who follows their old and entertaining movies.
