What a terrible movie. Starts well with the title sequence, but it's just as good as it is. The film is about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing pain. The actor is not so poor, but the script is useless, and the film is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. It's really amazing that a group has cobbled together this trash bag and thoughts would make a good movie. It's not a good movie. It's garbage and I urge you not to miss a minute of your life! One in ten.
