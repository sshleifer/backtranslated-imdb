I tried. I did. I thought that if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy the film. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA I felt sick and almost disgusted at the base, but some of the reviews were pretty good and in my favor, so I was like, "What the hell ... At least you did not pay $ 10 at Quad, give it a shot. "Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without previous anesthesia to ease the horror of such pain. I often wonder if it would not be better to go back to my childhood and ask our former aggressors to let me have it. On other occasions, I think the world really is paying, and if I go away, not only will I get rid of everything but that I will fall out and that something bad, Lovecraftan, will snatch me with 9,000 tentacles and squeeze my life - fried potatoes since 1995, which still persist in my esophagus - from me. Is there a reason for Odete? I would not say at all ... maybe her Creator thought writing a story centered on her madness (one that makes Alex Forrest look like a strawberry cake) is not just scary but crying on the bone. She, first of all, decides to leave her boyfriend today (in shrieking hysteria) because she wants a baby and thinks she's too young. Later, a homosexual burial crash collapses and, to get closer to him, he seems to be pregnant, as he sinks into the life of his mother and loved one in the worst ways. Of course, she calls out like a banshee and does not throw himself on one, but a good three times on the grave. And it is a ridiculous deal that she becomes progressively "Pedro," which sums up a poor and bad-hearted explanation that love does not know any kind. Or something like that. I'd say it's like nuts like a cashews box, unhealthy. But, again, the director. Me too, because you have a chance in this. At least men look good. Besides, there's nothing else to be seen here.
