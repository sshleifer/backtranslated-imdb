Even though 99.99% of those who have seen this movie are Brazilians, I will keep up with English because it is the language of this site. This film is a piece of cr * p. The worst act of action I've seen for a short time. Children are terrible. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw someone with a less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger and a single vocal tone, like a 5 year old child who was reading in front of the class. How can someone so badly be the main actor of a movie? The story is so superficial that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It's so simple that it could be written in a napkin and said in 3 minutes. There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teenager; 2) You have been so brainwashed by Globo's stupidity that you think any thing that has the Globo seal is wonderful; 3) you have a serious brain injury. Avoid at any price! A shame for the Brazilian movie scene.
