there was something real in this movie. I remember a story reported 15-20 years ago by 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and chose not to report it until their journey was over. I also remember that they were accused of intervening with a corpse (or such a charge). I'm not sure if he was in Australia. Spectators from outside Australia must believe we live in a country full of rape and serial killer. Wolf Creek and this movie would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of a simple plan. But as long as it is one of the best Australian movies ever, as somebody said, I can not be so generous. Put it this way, I would not mind to look again.
