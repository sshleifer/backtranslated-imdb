A very bad sequel. Part 1 had a lot of fun moments - part 2 is bad (in a boring way) and obviously it was made to squeeze money from fans. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only funny moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who seems to have written about the other characters. It's easy enough to identify with him ... The scenario is negligent / nonexistent. The director should make everyone a favor and immediately give up the job. The act is worse than a class II school. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is awful, but who can blame cinema / sound guys who have had to work with such a tireless director?
