This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida seems to become a more recognizable film area (such as Vancouver's prominence). The brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of regression for the area (which has made important strides with India's Walking Across Africa movie and the wonderful Earth-to-Moon HBO ministry). /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place for the Brothers movie. She had the potential to make a new move on the "Boy Band" madness. After all, both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come from this area. But the brethren probably collapse because of a poor scenario. Both characters are full, with almost no development (some of them might be amateur actors, but some are certainly the way the script was written). Also a problem is choosing jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they become funny for the first time, but it becomes a little dull). Some of the "concert" scenes unfold (and many of these scenes do not seem to move the story in any way). We had great hopes for this, but unfortunately a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the future feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for director John Figg is to move to different genres (fast). Comedy is not his strong suit. But, undoubtedly, he is definitely one of the most prominent film producers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame he's now infamous, not renowned). <br /> <br />
