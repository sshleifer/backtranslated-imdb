I rented this on DVD yesterday, and I did not realize it was a character character, so I tried to look at it for an hour before it hit the Stop button. Even with a theme-based study, I was not able to get into this movie at all. Maybe I wanted to see something else, or perhaps I had other expectations, but if I had left it, I tried everything I could do to look, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global mix did not come together to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was the steal of the sergeant who was stolen and rushed to buy another, and the spray painted black to appear as a police problem. I think the movie should have the right: "Who took down the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were good, but I put them together once again to feel robbed of something coherent to keep me. .. may be. For me, it was a waste of effort and time to watch. I'm letting you try, but it's not one I recommend.
