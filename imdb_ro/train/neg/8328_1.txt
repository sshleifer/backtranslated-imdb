If you want to watch a movie that is strangely shot, strange strange stories about these men (and a woman) who enjoy the beating of carp from each other if you want to enjoy a story that does not go anywhere from these two boys, one boxer and another homosexual, then you should watch this movie. After watching this movie, I felt almost as hurt and cut as the director of the movie beats the hell out of me. This is a movie in which someone is not meant to look for plot or for a great acting, it is a movie to look in horror and wonder. More as if you were following a plane crash or a train wreck. If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not. A warning to all who watch this movie, please do not eat in advance. You may want to beat yourself at the end of the movie.
