I want to be honest, this is one of the most serious movies in history. If not, then it is very close. Have you ever seen a teen teen evil teen. Well, this is like one of these. Unless worse. For example: (WAS SPOILER POSSIBLE) Girl: I want to go somewhere else. Tip: All we need is here. Girl: But I want to go somewhere different. </ br /> <br /> Tip: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... Continuing this line, doing sex. Music is a bad pop and a rock punk bad. If you read EVICUIT the book, avoid this movie like plague. It completely changes personalities and events. In addition, it just gets rid of things. Also, the movie ends before the book is finished. It's AWFUL movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teenage soaps, which are of inferior quality to low quality telenovelas, you go to it. Then again, should we expect something different from MTV?
