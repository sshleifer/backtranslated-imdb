I saw this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so badly that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was thrown like a policeman who never smiles or smiles, while the smile and his smile are two of his marks. Danny Glover was thrown as a bad man, but - again - the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not credible as a former student of medicine. The tension was not there, because the killer was known very early. The end was never again dramatic or tense: no one around me took care of what was going to happen next. All I could expect was the end of the movie. Generally, a disappointing evening at the cinema.
