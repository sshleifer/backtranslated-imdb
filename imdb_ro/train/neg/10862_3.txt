I saw 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none had any impact on me. I've seen some documentation about him. He is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge of movies and passion to make them, but that makes him a good director. Of course not! A complete anti-talent. Can he make a good documentary because of the above mentioned features, but a movie with actors? never! He can not direct or write. His scenarios are full of mistakes and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and ill-made that they can not be hidden behind the word "art" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unwavering direction, so amateur. To say he wants to direct that way and write shit like this is a lie. Like the scene when Scheitz is arrested and Storszek is hiding behind the shop. Who is the baby? He is a cheater; knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put into the scenario to get your attention and praise. Do not worry about the rest of the scenario and the careless direction. Look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, then I will recall my old films and try to find talent.
