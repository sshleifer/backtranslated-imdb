This movie could have been a decent B movie if 3/4 of the film did not focus too much on sexual scenes. I mean, she's sex-addicted, and I'm sure there's a lot more than sex addicts, besides having sex constantly. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what he was supposed to do, which was not much. At one point or another, he should laugh at him because his character was so poor. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as a sex therapist, but she could do more and I do not suggest sex. The one who made the most of me in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and preoccupied wife. There is something about the beauty inside and outside, which addresses me strongly. She played that role, and as you watched the movie, you'll start to feel sorry for her. "The Journal of an Addict Sex," while not Oscar, or a modern classical one for everyone, is quite informative and has a decent job in showing how personal demons can take over and destroy things in life you think so much.
