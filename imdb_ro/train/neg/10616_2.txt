Terrible. Just terrible. The scenario is controversial, acting painfully, and the story just draws along. It's undoubtedly a Sally Potter feast and something else. This would not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and star of the film, and that's just self-glorification. I found myself not worried about developing romance between the two main characters, and the conclusion did not come soon enough. It has two redemption characteristics. First, many of the photos are really beautiful, especially in Paris, and look pretty good in black and white. Second, if you're a fan of tango or not, music is great, excellent (unless Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh. I'm sure he's calling someone. Statistically, you have to.
