This program is really overestimated. A detective that Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred a few years ago to the "rubber guns team". The whole team is made up of sanctimonious gangs who are judging people whose actions turn decades after the 2007 standards. Every veteran Vietnamese character they ever had turned out to be the killer if he was not another Vietnam veteran. He was just a black killer and he was put by his white boss. The only Ukrainian killer was a "traitor of race" who murdered another Hispanic to form a Hispanic street child for a murder committed by two rich white children. What kind of propaganda. Hey, the screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit and murder. Only on this show are the most white class-class white criminals. In addition, the arrests of the people of the 1970s, '80s and' 90s for the crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder, because it means that the state will be stuck with ugly medical bills until it kicks. The state would do a favor to families and insurance companies. The prosecutor will plead for involuntary killing and will not serve one day. The only truly old criminals going to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis whose high sentences promote DA's careers.
