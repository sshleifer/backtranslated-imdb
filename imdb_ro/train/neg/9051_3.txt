I was so excited when I discovered that this was available! I could not wait to see him. What a loss of energy! It's a kind of rarity CD of your favorite band that you found in the back of your local music shop. Being a tough fan you were sure it was a valuable breakthrough. But once you hear it, it became obvious why these dogs never managed to make a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "completes" who must have everything Lynch did. "Six men who get sick" is somewhat visually interesting, but short and repeated. Does not have the power of Lynch's work "Grandma" is simply an immortal work. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it was in the '70s ... It is interesting only if you scared to psychoanalize the director. But you can see, in short, the seeds of images and sounds of its brand. "The alpahabet" is forgotten (not really, I do not remember at all!) "Amputea" is useless. "Cowboy and the French" is simply stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one worth the bouquet. Without dialogue, Lynch says a disturbing story comparable to the best work. I had to look at this many times. But it takes less than 2 minutes. It never deserves the difficulty of renting or buying the DVD.
