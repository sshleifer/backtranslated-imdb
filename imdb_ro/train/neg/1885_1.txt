If you are looking for a movie that describes the useless and boring existence of middle-class life caught in a network of unrecognized and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you also what the film to engage and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that make it much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darker films. The filmmaker felt that, in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should subject the viewer to an agonizing, boring and blackened incident after another, until the film finally reaches its perverse end. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, such as house cleaning, for example.
