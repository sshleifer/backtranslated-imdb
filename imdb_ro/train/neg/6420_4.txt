OK, I'll admit, it started very nice and good, but then it went down, I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading the script after about 5 minutes in the film, the only reason for which I actually stood through the whole I wanted to see my breathing at the Ned, and, to my surprise, well, people I can not even tell you if there was one, because the end just makes you confused, and then the credit role , I was like hell? this does not deserve a theater run, I'm sorry but did not mean it was horrible, the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts ... thats it! you can watch it, im not telling you not, hey it might even like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
