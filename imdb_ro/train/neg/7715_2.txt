Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon have cleared the garbage of their mind and have come up with the worst comedy, horror, Sc-Fi music. If there is any action, it is terrible or it can go over the top. Special effects; choose your ... very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap clich√© is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. It's worth a cold or six pack. Point your finger to the radiation if you need an excuse. The red moms grow up to the size of a towing truck and start attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place to start. Scientists and an absentee army must find the way to stop this red rolling threat. This favorite culture: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
