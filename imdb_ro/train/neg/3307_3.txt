My comments can be a bit of a spoiler, for what it's worth. Stop now if you care enough ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have been titled, "A thin paper excuse for British old women to get a high level on the screen." This movie is bad. Incidental music is an inconvenience, such as obvious, hackneyed songs, which appear sporadically to comment on the story ("Spirit in Heaven", for example - Oh, I understand!) This is mainly a Cheech and Chong movie credible by her stubborn setting English and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power to impress emotions on an audience using only her voice. I could literally hear those from the High Times magazine who got jollies over the enormous "buds" that cast this picture. The heaviest scene? Easy. Brenda is trying to sell her illicit goods on the street in London in a white suit. Not funny. Not original. Uninteresting. It's not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of the overcrowding of the zealots. Do not waste time ...
