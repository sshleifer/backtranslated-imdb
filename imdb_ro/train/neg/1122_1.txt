The actress is one of the worst things I've ever seen, the characters are totally unconvincing. This could be overlooked to some extent if the intrigue was interesting, which was not the plot for "The Prodigy." It's kind of a bad mix between "Fresh" and "Animal House," except that both movies were good.
