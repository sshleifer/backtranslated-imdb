This movie is absolutely terrible, but nevertheless, it can be hilarious at times, although this humor is entirely unintentional. The plot was beyond ridicule. I do not even think that a 2 year old child would be convinced of the ridiculous idiom the filmmakers were trying to push into a story. However, on the positive side, some of the terribly ingenious twists of the plot offer a lot of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a gigantic rocket hidden in the back yard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I will redeem you. The actor is generally ridiculous. Most children's roles are nice but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie's pretty awful. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but this is largely a good thing. If he tried to be credible, the movie would have been worse. Which is hard to imagine. Once you have passed the general past of the movie, there are, in fact, some exceptional moments of near-no-crappiness. The scene in which Lady Hogbottom's son runs along with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it is an annoying disappointment when caught by the police. The character of the butler, while very minor, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never loses through the darkness. Watching this movie caused me physical pain. However, there were some redemptive parties that made it almost visible without starting internal bleeding. Judged only on his good tracks, the film would be about 5; unfortunately, the rest of the film is hardly worth a 1. So I give it a 3. This is quite generous, I would say.
