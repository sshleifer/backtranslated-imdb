Barbara Streisand leads and plays in this very Jewish tale. To have the chance to get an education, Babs disguises himself with enthusiasm as a boy who is not the most difficult thing to do since he was already showing a boy anyway. At her new school she meets with many male colleagues who have no problems believing she is a guy. Do not miss the best moments of unintended humor when Babs male boyfriend thinks he is a man but cheats him on the ground, is on the top of his "he" and shows affectionately in his eyes ... * snicker *. Medium film; splash story about nothing particularly interesting.
