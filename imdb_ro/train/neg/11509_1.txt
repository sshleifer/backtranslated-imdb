I do not know what some of you are smoking, but I suspect it is strong. To call for defeat, it would be an insult to the very concept of terribility. The actress is terrible and I do not take Madonna here, we all know it is useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her disease is contagious. My back literally hurts to create so much on the poorly delivered lines. Editing is so negligent, describes begging. The photo and composition (which in this era, the competence should be GIVEN for any budget movie) are amazingly inept, even lighting is horrible and unnatural. These are fundamental elements of filming, if you can not do it well, you should look for another line of work. It's so controversial as a Grade 3 snow white production, except that it's almost never made or interesting. The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and a metaphor, gorgeous acting and writing, with breathtaking visual effects - you can basically taste the sea salt and feel the sand in the hair. Sexual tension feels real and immediate ... those of you who have found Guy Ritchie's deplorable version, should see it, is really one of the world's cinematic highlights. Those of you who thought the remake is a kind of masterpiece should examine your head.
