This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Did the avengers have this dubious honor? but it is not. The actor "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and was just eclipsed by the plot. This film is as intellectually stimulating as Telletubbes. He does not know if he wants to be a S & M movie or a very bad thriller. Look only in the state of extreme poisoning or if you are riding and need a chest distraction. This scenario should be reprocessed in porn, it would not take too much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porn, would not harm Dolf Lundgren's career as he does.
