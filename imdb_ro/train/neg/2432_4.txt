You do not have much to say about it. A plot that you can put in pretty much in the first 10 minutes. Nothing too bad with this movie, very little action for an action movie. It was an opportunity to explore the characters' emotions occasionally. If an action movie is the right kind to do that, I'm still not decided. The sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without paying full attention because it had small twists and a simple plot. I was probably guilty of this, so with a second watch or unlimited attention it might be better. 4/10 (but best of 4 out of 10)
