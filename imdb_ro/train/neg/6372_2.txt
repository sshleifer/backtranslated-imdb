Not disturb. A little prosciutto could go a lot, but all we get is pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of the protective gear episodes ... the vehicle knocks in another, and everything changes again in the direction until we just scratch our heads asking if there's ever a plot. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play over a mystical Dunaway, playing Lady Macbeth lost in Marx's duck soup. Ah, the Raven ... now he's an actor. And there is a relative who just lies and laughs and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread, who is full of sorrow and no remedy. I'm one of those suckers who just have to see a film all the way. Quoth Raven, "Nevermore".
