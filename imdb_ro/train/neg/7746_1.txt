Literally, every aspect of this low-budget science-fiction film falls into the categories that have been categorized for its predecessors, contemporaries and followers. Bad bad effects, a poor story, ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, annoying and unnecessary characters, all you can expect. The "Sabretooth Attack" is about a new holiday resort where owners are Smilodon genetic engineering cats for an attraction. Cats escape and start killing people, the guy who runs the show wants to save them and not to warn visitors who do not search for them, and there is a band of visitors and some employees who revolt and intend to kill cats. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - The film is about an average achievement of its budget. Savorettes are portrayed by poor CGIs. However, astonishingly, cats look more realistic in a closer, more detailed shot than longer, farther pictures, where CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are blatantly bloody and disastrous. As you would expect, attack, break some arms and legs and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film goes down poorly. Country and characters are just as terrible. We have some college kids coming to the island and planning a hunt for food. And take it very, very seriously. Just so much that it violates private property, manipulates security systems and steals. Why do I play so seriously? I missed something? Were money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, I could barely watch the movie. But it seemed to me she would do it just to please her. Even so, they went too far to be normal. "Sabretooth's Attack" is a very poor film. Even for a low-budget sci-fi movie, it is a very poor and cheap example. It will hold most viewers to tears, it could be attractive for some and make you laugh and laugh all the way. And remember, it's not a comedy, it's a cheap hit, so you do not have to be comic.
