It was highlighted in a post now removed from another IMDb user that anyone could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned about a scene that eerily reminds of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope someone who reads this will take this warning into consideration. Despite an interesting genealogy (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye," co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced Oscar nominated "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi" cast , I found "The Medusa Touch" to be an unintentional laughing revolt It was an inadequate, terribly written and accused misery It tried to capitalize on the genre of telekinetic thrillers in the 70s The film does not succeed in many respects. consider "Carrie" and underestimated "Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). There were two fun and exciting thrillers dealing with the same subject.
