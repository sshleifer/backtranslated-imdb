This movie could have been an interesting character study and could have given some insight into its subject, but a real problem with this movie is that it has nothing in it. It provides no understanding - or solutions to the problem. It is just about portraying the "old" male addiction and the problems that it creates for its everyday life and family. Why do you want to look at this? Everything is so totally useless and meaningless. It also does not really help that the main character is a 50+ year old man. You will find it difficult to identify and sympathize. He seems just like an old dirty player, which is a constant hunt for woman and sex. She has all sorts of sexual relationships about 3 times a day with a different woman and not just with prostitutes. He also does not have a bad visual style, though he feels a little forced. But, however, it is much better than most direct-to-video productions. Who knows if movie producers would have been given better material to work, the movie would have deserved better faith. The story becomes ridiculous at times. There are really unnecessary plot lines that are often much more ridiculous than it should have been obvious. I mean, for example, the entire Ordell plot. Things get worse once the movie begins to move to the end. Also, all kinds of story is said, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple. But, in terms of bad movies, this is not one of them. It's not at all better or worse than any other direct, direct, similar concept. However, it seems strange and quite astonishing that they managed to distribute Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a small, insignificant little production like this one. I think they were really desperate for work and money. 4/10
