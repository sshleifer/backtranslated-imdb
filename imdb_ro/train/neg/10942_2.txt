Lorenzo Lamas plays the role of Jack `Solider` Kelly, an ex-Vietnamese veterinarian and a renegade policeman who goes on a quest and destroys the mission of saving his sister from the roots of roots. The Atrocious movie is so cheap and so bad that Ron Palillo is the third billed and still has 3 minutes of screen, and even those are not good. Overall, a terrific movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hung from a wrapped and gagged tree deserve some laughter (unintentional). Followed by an improved sequel.
