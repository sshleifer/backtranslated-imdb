It just seemed quite interesting. How can a brutal real life crime be transformed into a really boring movie? Well, you can look at "Wonderland" and find out. I heard about Wonderland crimes before this movie was released and found it as an interesting story of truly sad people. Unfortunately, there is a zero character development, so we never have the chance to understand why this has been done or to have a good sense of character relationships. The pace of the direction was very tedious. All this leads to an extraordinary boring movie. Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associated producer and that Holmes's wife was a film consultant, we should have had the opportunity to get a true perspective on the characters.
