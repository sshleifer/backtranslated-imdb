I will say something about this movie: there is no swearing. You do not get bored to watch that. The problem is that it's too intense. There is too much action and coverage is needed! This is the risk you take in modern action movies. You want interesting, but not too much. Although the act is fine and has some "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, he still has a "B" movie. The best part is Scheider's dialogue: the only part "A" of this movie "B". The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mentality, but it has had some exceptional scenes. One, in particular, was a very innovative scene with field mines. It was memorable. There were not enough other scenes to make this a goalkeeper for a long time.
