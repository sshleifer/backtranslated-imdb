I can sum up this movie with 20 words or less. The way too predictable of a story line with the potential to be fun, but instead collapses on the face. However, I did not fully realize this one-shot shot, but instead of deciding to give her two stars because Julie Bowen smokes hot and offers just enough candy to prevent me from breaking the DVD from the device and blowing with a M80. My advice, take the rental fee of $ 4.00 that you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right for me as an advance thank you for saving you time and frustration of being forced to stay through this wreck the train , or you might want to send a $ 50 replacement fee for which you would have had to take out twelve gags to use this piece of trash as a glass shooting practice.
