In over 70 years of watching movies, it has to be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have made some very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. It's unpleasant from opening up to pushing the scene during the credit. Diane Keaton, who I normally like, should have needed her bad salary. She desperately needs to revive her craft. Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is), needs a better director, to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not up to her role. Mike White has to find another character, he has made the same type of person a few times too many. Ken Howard, who began years ago as a leading actor, also not as good as he was to be. There is nothing decent I can say about this movie comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
