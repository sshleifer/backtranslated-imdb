Saving Grace is certainly one of the most important competitors for the movie "How to Destroy a Perfect Last Minute Movie". Of course, if you mix a village in Cornwall, which is largely populated by retired ladies with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of humiliation will result. However, the last seven minutes of the film go down ridiculously and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It's a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be as good as Waking Ned Devine in 1998, which portrayed a small picturesque village, and its inhabitants themselves are trying to get out of a difficult situation. Saving Grace's protagonist is middle-aged, recently widow Grace Trevethyn, whose inheritance to her husband's bad debt has led her in an unconventional way to earn money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, turns her horticultural expertise into lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with local police, her husband's creditors, and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . who all return simultaneously to her own greenhouse. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthew are well represented, and Brenda Blethyn becomes the emotionally viewer involved in her pleasant character - you can really feel what's going through her. Casting of minor roles is excellent, even though some of them are quite eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques, the drug maker, into Grace's romantic interest, is extremely implausible and does not suit the tone of the film at all. And certainly hydroponic is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis cultivation? Unfortunately, the film changes gentle humor for slapstick and becomes as fake as marijuana plants.
