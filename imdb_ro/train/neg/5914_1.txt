This movie is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I understand why. It is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but just because the film is of such a low quality. I would never want to pay money to follow this. I like the films from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed that such a poor film could come out of China. He seems to ignore the audience, and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The photos of a person sitting there and doing nothing within a minute are hilarious and there are plenty of them. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the Internet and it seems that people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie lovers believe that if a movie is not in English it is automatically good. I see no reason why people would like it. this film is not a film of art, it is a waste of celluloid (that if they actually shot it on film, what they did not do)
