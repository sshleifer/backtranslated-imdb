I had a lot of hope for this movie and so I saw it with many expectations; mainly due to Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who has marked his footsteps in the sands of time forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, brutality and violence in the shadows and in the orange watch look a lot better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very bold police officer. Who is designated to investigate brutal serial killings? Raghavan effectively finds the connecting wire in this case, and is close to solving the crimes and put the psycho killers, two psychologically disrupted but brilliant medical students behind the bars, but escapes and again getting into a slaughter. Eventually Raghavan kills them after they save many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho-killers are the ones who want to keep the public going to the theater. Sexual crimes and harassment and rape are very explicit, shown that the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> To even imagine that teens and children will be watching this movie in the theater and a kind of picture is bound to paint in their minds, certainly not enough. The director, Gautham, should understand that he also has a certain duty towards society and audience. Certainly he did not go to the movie looking for what the Gautham name would be on the production list.
