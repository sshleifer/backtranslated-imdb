I came to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon. Here's what I have learned: Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not homosexual. EVER. This was clearly established at the beginning of the film and was strengthened every five minutes or thereafter. So it's safe for American guys to see this movie. Helen of Troy always had her hair and makeup flawless. She looked gorgeous in all her short cam of scenes, which, although numerous, were probably all filmed the same day one after another, with the director saying: "Okay, now look nice ... well ... OK, now looks scared ... good ... now looks depressed ... good ... now looks interested ... good ... now looks beautiful again ... well ... "Most Greeks and Trojans have British accents. Those with American accents were unable to act. The Trojans showed exactly the Greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen. Brad Pitt is not blinking. <br /> <br /> The biggest line of Helen in Troy was, "They come for me." The Trojan music has remarkably sounded like modern Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way. Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but he's fine. It was summer. It does not matter what history says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole can tell a whole story with just one expression. The Trojan gods seem to have all the Greek names, but their statues were forgotten by the Egyptians or Peter O'Toole dearly. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touched if they did not fight, just like American men. All the thousands of extracts in the movie were exactly the same color ... The Egyptian Light, by Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy had only three women. There were a lot of blond Greeks, which is good news for Brad Pitt, which otherwise would have really stayed. Despite their coastal desert location, the Greeks had the ability to find innumerable quantities of wood to build fireplaces, funerary pirates, Trojan horses, and the like. br /> <br /> British actors look stupid with Greek hair. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt changes his expression only when the sun shines directly in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers have fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable. Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts. It seems that the Greek temples were always in ruins, even when they were us.
