A pretty, cute guy falls for a cute blonde; He also likes it, but not for the reasons you might think. The little black comedy seen by writer Pat Proft shows great performance by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon but has no lasting impact. It's just a quick throwing effort, led by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even at comedy level B, somewhat similar to "Eating Raoul" is a better bet. There is certainly amusing fun here; unfortunately, the picture has no place to go into the second act. An interesting try, but this is because of fires. <br /> <br /> ** de la ****
