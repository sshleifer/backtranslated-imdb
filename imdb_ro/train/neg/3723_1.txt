Sections taking advantage of this film are well known for their claim to take the "message" of the Bible without any change or extra-biblical influence. The existence of this film is due only to the fact that there is no such thing. If you want to know which branch of Christianity born again believed in the seventies, look up the word "abduction" in a cult and sect dictionary. It's faster than staying with this celluloid waste. Poor quality of quality, uneven sound and a script that could be written equally easily by Jack T Chick (a paranoid theorist of Christian conspiracy for those who are not familiar with the Evangelical Scene). You could not put this in the "so bad is good" category, so its only audience is either the one who has a collection of brochures that is going to be unfolding or extremely paranoid.
