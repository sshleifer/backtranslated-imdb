Strictly a routine, by-the-west numbers (directed by the genre-pillar Andrew V. McLaglen, so is it any wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith is banishing the smart band, Dean Martin, who just kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who did not find a niche after playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger). Fist-fights, shooting, diving robbery and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking in a low monotonous way, Keith gets to work with a prostitute (something of a shock after his flight in the movie "Affair Family"), but otherwise this cheap material loses Keith's kind talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to watch or care. Rate hack, bad writing and some dysfunctional attempts at lowball humiliation. * from ****
