Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner, which he called a good science fiction film, Nemesis. As we have watched this, we found ourselves as we headed for BS tracks just to get incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to hit and hit. And hit! haha <br /> <br /> The Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one he grew up in. He is following the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join the Mexican torture band that tortures his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a mad band). Gruner plays a typical typical Van Damme, which kills everyone (or destroys them badly) and works to get rid of these gangs. The plot was very cheesy and easy to think. Gruner is probably not well known because of his scenario - if you choose this movie to compare the possible options. This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the crew full of characters go through it as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. Music was a typical action music (beat and timer pianos, swelling of guitars), which was not really as bad as calling her. The director really needed to keep the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. Finally, I gave her a 4/10 because she really tried to be a medium action film for Oliver Gruner to play, but the overall feel of the movie lets you close what you just saw.
