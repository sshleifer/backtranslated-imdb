It's hard to put hatred almost constantly in this movie. But I will try: Each word was an expletive, sexual scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were exaggerated, and stereotypes were beyond normal, if not offensive to American Italians. I'm not saying that acting was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. he did well. But ... almost every character in the movie I despised. Not since Bonfire of Vanities disliked every character on the screen.
