What you will get when you mix a piece of cliché with a non-directional pacing and a group of characters that you do not care about and an unsuccessful attempt to create an eye-catching visual style and a larger piece of clichés and a poor sense of humor and a very large budget? Why, you get one of the most innovative junk movies ever made! I mean, of course, to Domino. Here are some things people might say while watching this movie: "Ooh, wow, the story is said from the sequence, which was not done a billion times before and much better than in this movie "Wow, look at all the blinking lights and the granular film texture and elaborate the director trying so much to make things look artistic and establish a visual style! It's too bad that neither of these effects adds anything to the movie or makes sense to the scenes it's in, and it's also too bad that most of us see it as irritating! "I heard the exchange of dialogue twenty thousand films before!" I saw this scene around thirty thousand movies before! <br /> <br /> "And that! "<br /> <br />" Have not they unveiled this story "plotting" about half an hour ago? which should be surprising? <br /> <br /> "If this movie should be showing a" tough chicken "going around kicking ass ... when why not doing much of it? "" I can not believe how uniginal this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this? I feel like I've been watching it for over four hours. "" I have no idea what happened, but I also do not feel particularly motivated to try to figure it out. <br /> <br /> "Is it all over? "<br /> <br />" I want the money back. "" The songs in this soundtrack feel so wrong here "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the curses they use actually get rid of the impact of each "<br /> <br />" UGH ". And finally: "I may have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie." In summary, this film is a failure in almost every aspect. If your house is on fire and this movie is played in the single room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider burning alive instead. <br /> <br /> (If it sounds bitter, it is because I just spent two hours watching this movie and I did not like it very much.)
