It made no sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like this ... you have nothing to do. cutter of men or hunter what should I say ... it hurt me! Oh God! the film is about people we do not know, but they feed on people! have teeth bla bla bla ... is not familiar? I can bet you saw her in another movie. the distribution was so great, but I think the scenario was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was absolutely wonderful ... he is so talented ... in fact, I said horribly, but I think because of horrible scenes ... let me explain. have you ever eaten your tongue? but in the movie a person did it! it was really terrible ... anyway, I think the movie would be so good without the terrible or hideous scenes ...
