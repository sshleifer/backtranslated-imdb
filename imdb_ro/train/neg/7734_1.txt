This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak - I could not even follow it. The actor is a pupil. The soundtrack is irritating. Humorous attempts are not. Editing is horrible. Credits are really slow - I would be embarrassed to tell my name associated with this loss of film. Do not waste your time even if you think of this attempt to act.
