W. Somerset Maugham's of Human Bondage should be classic in English. If so, you must have missed much of the movie version here. The attraction of Phillip (Leslie Howard) to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable to make the script look like a post-breakup resumption of a relationship from the point of view of the man. Being a family lawyer I heard many such accounts; man describes himself as noble and always right, and the woman is a hell who has no other goal than to exploit man. Indeed, if he is not willing to laugh at the social assumptions of film maker, it is an inconvenient movie to watch. Phillip even allows Mildred to bring a child of undetermined paternity, but the true point of view comes when Phillip allows Mildred - angry, and now with a doubtful doubt - the free movement of his apartment with predictable results. Bette Davis has been appealing for about five years of life, but that period has not happened here. Actually, by the end of the movie, she looks very much like the character Baby Jane that she will play thirty years later. We notice that Howard's character is impeccably dressed and dressed. He told me that Phillip wanted the respectability of the middle class. Someone like this could not run fast enough from a woman with a Cockney course. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; such a person would have been more credible if she were younger and would have had perfect looks to tell her the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov, as he will. And balanced that, allowing Mildred a charm of charm.
