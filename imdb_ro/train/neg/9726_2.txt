This is a fascinating film of horror. It's so little that it starts to make a strange internal logic. Well, it would be if he did not keep from the side alleys until he had finally come under the weight of his own indecisiveness. The film can not be thought of as a "Man Turns Into Monster" movie (similar to all those ING MAN's "INCREDIBLE verb INGEDIBLE" movies) or a business conspiracy theory film, or a mystical life after life contact, or ... or what? Choose. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and pulling in all directions, leaving the free ends around the place. It was as if Hoop Hooper had taken David Lynch's pills. Unfortunately, he did not get enough.
