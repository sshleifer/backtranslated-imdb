{rant start} I did not want to believe it first, but I think this is what people say when they say that South Korea's cinema has reached its climax and can even go down. After the surprisingly fun and moving film "Gwoemul" in 2006 - which managed to make a sharp satire from a B movie genre - the successive Korean bands have become more and more generous, even though their budgets (especially spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. South Korean movie makers really want to squander all the public and investor willingness that their industry has built after the 1999 Shiri / Swiri movie, making a whole series of large mediocre films such as China continental? {end end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can understand for making this film is to avoid investors funding the most detailed and fluid digital animation of the Korean / East Asian dragon that I I have seen so far for the final scenes. Now if he had introduced that dragon in the beginning and given him more personality and purpose than in 1996's "Dragonheart", the film could have had more ransom qualities than having a lot of digitally animated dragons . Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? No one has learned that trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well do you use it? I hope there are several (and better) Korean legends I can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in the Korean dragons' legends of how they filmed it. In short, I agree with all the negative comments that have gone before and wonder how the Koreans felt that they had their "Arirang" anthem at the end. As a feature of the creatures, I would have given at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences would have been worth it, but I saw many video games with better camera and scripture work (less dragons).
