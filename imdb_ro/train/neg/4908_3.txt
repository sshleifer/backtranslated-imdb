This movie should take place in and around Seattle. Why is the Porteau Cove Park P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L? Provincial parks are located in CANADA and not in the United States. The inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with the pen to "read" that someone has entered the wedding shop computer. I did not know that this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without any introduction and is never introduced. We learn in half the movie that this woman works in the prosecutor's office. Then, in the correctional center, a Warden prefers Jenks through a door and keeps his back to the offender! This would NEVER happen in a real correctional framework. The director really went that - that's not the case in real life. Acting is appropriate. The plot is good. Cinema is good. However, many errors found continuously lead to a vote of 3 out of 10.
