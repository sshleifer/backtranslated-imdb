A man brings his new wife to his home, where his ex-wife died of an "accident." His new wife was released from an institution and is also very rich! Suddenly he starts to hear noises and see skulls everywhere. Is she crazy again or is she the first wife to return from the dead? You probably guessed the end, so I will not write it. I have seen the Saturday afternoon TV as a child. Then I liked it, but I was young. Seeing now, I realize how bad it is. It's acting horribly, badly written, very boring (even at one hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one being the director)! Still, she has some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and the nearby pond is beautifully atmospheric. There are also some scary moments (I jumped a bit when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. Generally, it's certainly not a good movie ... but no total disaster. It has a small worship following. I give it a number of 2. Try also to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in edition (it's associated with "Leeches Throat Attack"). It is in TERIBLE form, with jumps and scratches everywhere. It does not look so bad on TV!
