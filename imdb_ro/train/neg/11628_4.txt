Wow You guys are way too nice! Corny, Corny, Corny So I feel about that movie. He started well with a good idea, One guy (Edward Asner) gets out of prison dressed like Santa, a bunch of kids find him and thinks Santa's true, so Fake Santa hires kids to help him find a bag of money stolen. the movie is like a Christmas version of "Whistle Down the Wind". The movie starts fine but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you can not take this movie seriously. For example, you have a Scrooge type character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), which is a total of Douchebag who treats his son as a heap of rubbish, treats his son so bad that he does not buy even his clothes decent, jeans with holes in it! but a scene of 45 seconds with Fake Santa visits Sumner and by the end of the movie you take the happy man singing Christmas and giving his son a hug ... a hug ... like Corny is ... I'm still for a good movie , especially during Christmas and are a great fan of the seasonal television movie, but it's too much above the top for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the second half of the film betrays a supernatural element film does not match the rest. It is not bad at all, there is a strong action, especially from the children, but there is a lot of better Christmas film around it.
