After two weeks of "The Singles of Beauty" I'm a little disappointed. Some of the actors are good, as long as we are only dramas. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how I can feel that FICTIONAL DRAM is a "real" coverage of "Thatcher" years - it's a good drama but I feel the winning book is still a lot better. > I wonder if BBC will ever give us the track and the next part of the drama and the following years with "Things Can Be Better" finishing with 2006 and the fact that we are still waiting! with the promise made by a lame government.
