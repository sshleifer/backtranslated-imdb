This type of movie has now become the old hat, is not it? Everything is a silly nostalgia that has transformed itself into a kind of feedback loop. It seems to be a good idea: a large distribution, some good gags, and a human drama about what might or could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event linking them all, as in "The Big Chill," one of the serial films that gave rise to similar films. Finally, you want to see more people or more people, instead of doing nobody. The superficiality that it creates is not only annoying but maddening. Script below the media does not help.
