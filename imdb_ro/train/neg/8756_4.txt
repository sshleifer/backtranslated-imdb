Russell Hopton acted in many movies until his death in 1945. He directed only 2, and "Black Gold" was one (the other was from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive presence on the screen, but in this game he played a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the "fast" circuit - he made so many movies. Here is a son of an old rigid oil who is convinced he will kill the oil very quickly. J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man to sell as he knows the oil will be hit at all times. A geologist, Henry, comes on stage and helps Fishtail's father. He also convinces Fishtail to go to school regularly. Henry's eyes are on Cynthia, cute teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she began her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail's father" is killed when the platform is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his friends to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade Fishtail to sell his oil lease contract. Everything ends well with the oil being hit and "Fishtail" goes to the military school. It's good for a rainy day.
