Recently, I saw the documentary "The Revolution Will Not Be Broadcasted to Television", also known as "Chávez: Inside the Strike". At first I thought she showed a real internal vision of the events during the Venezuelan coup in April 2002. What disturbed me was the fact that the tone of the narrative and accompanying music were suggestive and that no criticism Hugo Chavez. This is special, because if a documentary gives a non-biased note about what happened, there should have been some of them. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is for many years, much more information is available on the internet nowadays and was not hard to find, for example, "Urgent Investigations of Chavez - The Strike by the 5 European Corporations television that funded the film has flagrant lies about Venezuela. "She lists the many misconceptions and intentional or unintentional falsifications in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string on Google, you'll find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of the many errors found in this documentary, The Radiation of a Lying. For me it seems to be a good counterweight for "Chávez: inside the coup" It is available at video.google. I strongly advise you to see "Chávez: inside the coup" look at the "radiograph of a lie" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowingly or not) part of Chávez's propaganda.
