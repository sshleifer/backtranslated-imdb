After watching this movie on DVD, I looked at the trailer. Voice-over describes the film as surrealistic. Well, it's surreal, and it's surreal. It was really just a part of the movie that seemed surreal to me, but honestly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, especially the scene in the cellar where everyone is on the floor, were so absurd that they did not make any sense. I do not mind the pictures that mean nothing, but these scenes seemed irrelevant. My impression is that the director is trying to convey Logan's own monologue. I do not know what else could explain what's going on. Unfortunately, none of what I saw gave me any idea what Logan was thinking about, what a perspective it was, or even her emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly pleased with his physical appearance and that he was battling an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the end showed what relationship the boys had become, but did not do anything else. The ambiguous scenes that were juxtaposed, with the simplest, seemed more like a cop than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> However, the film was as tiring and content as it was for me, it was a definite change of pace. I really liked Madagascar Skin and I felt like this movie had an aspiration for this kind of narration and perhaps even style. He's not even close. For me there is no doubt: this film deserves a hard effort but a D for execution.
