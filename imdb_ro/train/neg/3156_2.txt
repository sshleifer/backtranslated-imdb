I just want to do a clear thing - I like Michael Vartan! But this film really lets them come down. His acting is still gorgeous, he's still as charming as he is, and still looks great. But the film itself is a garbage truck! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it, come over the man ... constantly wait for her to run away with her best friend, which is her own sub-story is a bit strange. Me and my family (who sat down and watched the movie with me) were also stripped of the soundtrack of the film; sometimes the music did not match what was happening in the scene. However, even this was not the worst aspect of the movie that seemed to me to be a very disappointing film. I could forgive the lady's shed, I could forgive the strange characters who were thrown into the mix and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice would be to cut the whole middle section of the film and jump straight to the end? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but the way it gets there is left unhelpful. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy a poster instead.
