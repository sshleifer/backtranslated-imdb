After seeing The Bodyguard last night, I felt compelled to write a review of it. That could have been a pretty decent film if it had not been for the awful thing with the camera. It was beyond annoying. The angles were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during combat sequences. The buildings were really horrible. The story has Sonny Chiba committing himself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to take him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never quite right with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, because Mob and another gang of criminals are after her. The story was decent and, despite the horrible dubbing, it could have been a good movie. Given a better direction and editing, I'm sure it would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it is, it's more like another action movie of 70. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence has a familiar quote for Pulp Fiction fans, then goes to a Times Square Karate School , which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
