Do not be fooled as we were through the "brilliant" reviews on the DVD box. "Fun-filled fun," "a frightening weird," and worst of all, "JAWS PARTNER". This movie is none of the above. Normally, I'm not bothered to write bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe it rests at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It's not worth it. After an attack so open by a monster that created what else, the chemicals released by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and goes down there. Practically and unlikely, a girl is hit by a monster (I'll give her points for a created design, but it's not a WETA creation), and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half watching her ... in the canals that surround the river Inn. Their search has no suspense - someone called this thing the same with the Jaws - and when they find it, you realize that everything is useless. Besides, much of the film engages in a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene involving a guy spitting into a trough in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I'm not kidding. Want to see a round monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
