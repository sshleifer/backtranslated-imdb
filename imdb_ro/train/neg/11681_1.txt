Trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I would have liked to have waited for the movie to come on DVD, because at least it would not have cost $ 9. The movie totally misses the mark. What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors turned out to be a B movie at best. The movie moved very slowly, and even when I thought she was going somewhere, she almost did it, but then she did not. In this day and age, we need unpredictable overturns and closures in the film, and this film has not been offered. The whole thing about how everyone is suspicious is good, however, is not sure whether it was the way it was directed, enlightenment, delivery of lines, writing or what, but nothing came from it. Many hype for nothing. I was VERY disappointed in this movie and I tell everyone NOT to see it. The music of the saxophone brown has made the film worse. And the end had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
