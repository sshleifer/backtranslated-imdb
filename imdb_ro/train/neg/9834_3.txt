One of the most literate "Lone Stars", with time spent on character development and interaction, dialogue and business actors. The opening scene puts scenes (literally) for the personality of the player, Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler), and his friend John Scott (John Wayne), rodeo (says Roh-Day-oh) Randy. The film follows their adventures, trying best for each other in pursuit of Mexican Juanita, and later looking to be the courageous Mary Kornman, who has his bad brother inevitable (though he had been lost by the real villain and wants to repent). And, of course, they are wrongly charged with two crimes and must serve prison before escaping and being exonerated at the end of the year. The high point is Scott continuously and deliberately mirrors Mary's ass in her grocery store and knocks on the ladder she surrounds so she can catch her and catch her when she falls. Everything seems little contemporary for a 30-year-old West, but it sounds better than it really is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the exciting action items we find in many other Lone Stars are very devoid of this. Not Yakima Canutt. Inappropriate and inappropriate use of stock images of horsemen riding horses. Not George Hayes. Boring as a bi-play between Scott and Charlie, Charlie's swing at Scott, Scott stomping on his leg and then punching him (repeated twice!). Paul Fix is ​​inadequately used. Eddy Chandler himself, here in his great turn of stars, is not really credible like a randy side shot. The bastard looks too old and fat. And Chandler, who has spent his last career in 300 other movies as uncreated beef. Mary Kornman, twenty years old, "The Gang" (see "Mary, Queen of Tots" 1925) is nice in her scenes with John Wayne, but that's about it. Seeds of a better lie of the West buried here. The ultra-short, colorful version that looks good moves so fast, it stops if it blinks more than once. Fortunately, the embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler were cut.
