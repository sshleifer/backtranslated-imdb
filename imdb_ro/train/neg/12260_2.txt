Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about sharks and / or killer crocodiles are still being done these days. They made these "washers" of childhood blades in the 1970s, it does not look like they enjoy them. The idea is still exactly the same. We have an animal that starts killing people. It first records a few secondary characters, then starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a few nobodies, except for someone who was a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get a last shot where we see the animal is still alive, or put eggs, etc. and so on "Krocodylus" essentially uses the same ideas that are still in use, and there is absolutely nothing to create even a bit of variation. If you do not count the fact that the "specialist" is a captain in this variant, in this case your standards are quite low. It is strange that he played by Duncan Regehr although he usually liked to be Zorro.Hell I would give him a bonus point for that.
