I always wanted to see this because I like terrible horror films and a title like that, I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be very fun. It was not really. The actor was badly amusing, the script contained some lines of classical evil, and the special effects seemed to have shed all over the main actor, so I should have loved him. Unfortunately, it is very fond of these points. I decided to look in the last half of the movie as we made the tax statement. That's boring this movie. However, if you like bad movies, you will enjoy the dramatic exit of Fat Assist and the starring role of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor, he has to deliver incredibly inept lines with his right face - such as the conversation he has with his wife in pursuing IM Man: <br /> <br /> with a geiger counter . "It's radioactive?" Only a little. "Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a super-zombie killing machine only with what looks like a mini-Dyson He is a brave man. "Unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a bunch of hoop on a tree." Oh God, it's his ear! "Dr. Ted says to the audience, I'm so glad he eliminated it. /> <br /> I realize that this movie sounds more fun. It would have been if it was only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes even further, and the incredibly melted Dude is rushing to make a sticky mess when you have to eat more people in my opinion. I think if you really had stones, you probably would like it, you just do not have pop-tarts during the movie because the lead actor resembles with one near the end.
