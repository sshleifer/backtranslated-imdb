I think this is a horrible film produced and directed. Benicio Del Toro should not work in the production of films, he should focus on his acting and that is. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole idea of ​​the revolution, its ideals, and the most important thing about Che Guevara's life and so on. The room is terrible, as if someone with a working experience of 2 days shooting with it, the music is ... I do not know .. is there some music in the movie ???? I will not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It's just waste about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything .... I can not figure out how anyone can rate this movie more than 3 stars. Disaster ... disaster ... disaster ... disaster Do not forget, please. Save this misery of "film"
