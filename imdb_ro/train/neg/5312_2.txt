Usually a terrible garbage from director Fred Olen Ray about a cyborg hunter (Teagan), commissioned by director Jan-Michael Vincent, to find and execute the extraterrestrial extraterrestrial Ross Hagen, who drew the course of the earth. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of children with a regular school school run by the Richard Wiley network who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone. Soon, the cyborg will throw a laser gun by burning an innocent alcoholologist (Robert Quarry by Count Yorga-Vampire), proving that no one will stand in his way to recover the prisoner's hiding man, whose collar is a device tracing weakens his body. The law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, a Vietnam veteran veteran with too many weapons in his cabin. Perhaps intentionally terrible, this presents what fans of "rancid cinema" want for ... the effects, the action and the premise. At least, the film has PJ Soles for some candy eyes. Even in '89, she was quite smoky. The safe laser gun is funny. It can burn some houses even when Cyborg shoots the law just to leave a sign in the trapped location.
