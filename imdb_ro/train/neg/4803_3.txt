Adrianne, he should get a life without Mr. Brady. It makes me dizzy and was one of the main reasons I know more to see the show. It is a brainless show, and any argument or disagreement seems to be implemented and analyzed until death. This makes them seem to sound like they're only ready for marriage, and yet I know that these disagreements are all part of life. I think for some it's fun. If this happens in the coming season, I'm sorry for anyone who has nothing more to do with their lives, but they are following this garbage. Though I would not be terribly surprised. I can no longer support the commercials for this show! I hope they get enough money to hurt themselves in front of a weekly room after a week. However, girl "A" has a big ass!
