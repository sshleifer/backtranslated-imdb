From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to crumble a lot, but I did not think it was HERE bad. I've seen a lot worse, actually. "The House of Evil" is a ghost story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who moves into the old Japanese home. You know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered her wife and lover and then committed suicide 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. Because strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous inhabitants begin to hold the bodies of the living and the plan to revive the bloody murder that occurred 100 years ago. I saw this movie and decided to give her a chance, the cover looked like a fantastic story. It was routine, and it was weird, but I've seen it worse in my day. The phantom sequences have been slightly overcome, we see that the translucent figures in blue randomly occur randomly around the family and take their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts at Mansion Haunted at Disneyland. I may be wrong, but after I looked at it, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the film broke him a bit. The old Japanese house where a brutal crime, a ghostly activity, curses at home, and so on. But maybe I'm wrong. To summarize, it's a ghostly story. Do not get out of the way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come to TV, you can give it a chance. 4/10.
