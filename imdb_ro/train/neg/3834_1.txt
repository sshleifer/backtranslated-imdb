You watched this movie that really enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. It was stupid. The plot was vaguely disagreeable with the teacher and his friend penetrating over 14-15 year old girls in very short skirts. The previous order seems to think this does not matter, but it seemed pretty ugly to me. If you have children at school, then the last thing you want is to think that each young teacher is polished by his pupils. We were surprised that censorship left that. Besides, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was poor, and John Gordon Sinclair tried too hard to reconstitute his scholarly image, easily stray from the wall. Why anyone would want to be invited to this show is incredible. This movie has failed in all respects. Dreadful. Please do not waste your time watching. Life is too short
