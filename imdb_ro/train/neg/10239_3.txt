Jude Law takes everything in this beautiful, vampire film that has nothing to do with value. Completely deprived of eroticism, enthusiasm, or ladies with recourse. A decent fight, a few moments of light suspense. And a plot with only one note. The film became philosophical in a series of conversations between the character of Law and a homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are burdened at the intersection of the banality of the film. With a smaller actor in the lead role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinema - the crocodiles would mix into the fast-paced, low-budget vampires.
