I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I like the exaggerated foreign comedies - especially the weird ones that completely surprise you. However, although this has often surprised me, they have never been pleasant surprises. He reminded South Park of the fact that almost every social norm was violated until the only ones who left to return were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (almost any way - from pot, heroin, speed to watering), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie came to the hilarious subject (? pedophilia.Mother encouraged a son (who was around 12 years old) to sleep with the neighboring men.In fact, at some point in the film, she gives the boy to the dentist instead of paying for dental work! This film goes too far and goes into the "black hole of comedy." What should be the fun of the next, cancer or rectal tumors?
