I just hope no old classicist / historian has seen "Cleopatra" or, if they did, they took it as a laugh. The film is horribly inaccurate, laughable and even "Gladiator" (at least a well-written script, whose historical errors are articulated and correspond well to storytelling). The most flagrant is Octavius, the heir of Caesar, in the Senate, before the assassination of Caesar: at the age of 19! Besides, the act is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a suggestion about James Bond in him when he says: "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a great Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries to be the best seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not at all good), but it comes as an incredible thing. So this is a warning to all historians - this movie is not true for life!
