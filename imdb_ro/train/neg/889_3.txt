I have never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime," I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been in NY many times and I love his city and its neighborhoods. I was expecting to be touched by this movie, to feel like flying on an airplane and flying there immediately, but here and here, I regret the time and money I spent with him. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are many encounters and dysfunctional relationships or people who know each other and do not work well. Perhaps this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it is said to have thousands of people living alone. Can not find love in New York?
