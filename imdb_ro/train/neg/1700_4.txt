In the movie, I feel like it should be more than art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story, but not too much. I felt it was weird, but too bizarre to be a comedy. The movie is good, but there is nothing else. As I have already said, I'm a great fan of David Lynch, but I'm frustrated with some of his work, because I do not see it at all. This is definitely the least favorite thing I've ever done, but I know she still has a ton of talent and I'm thrilled to see what we have in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out, but do not surprise yourself when you do not like too much.
