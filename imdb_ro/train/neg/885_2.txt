An anthology is always risky business and I think this effort should be praised. There are many talents involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had. First, the segments vary incredibly by tone and quality. And, unfortunately, some of them collide with the others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped for me. Like seeds of good stories, which never get to fruition. I'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an end time), but rather, they lack basic development or even solid sets that attract you. Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its inhabitants were portrayed properly. What's left is short films that may still be of interest to some, but will leave ordinary viewers dissatisfied.
