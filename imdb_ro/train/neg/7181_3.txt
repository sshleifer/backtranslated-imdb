now do not misunderstand me, I like Christmas movies. I like a wonderful life and I am very happy with the versions of a Christmas carols with george c. Scott and alistair sim. but this movie is terrible. I think I love the song of life that the ghost of Christmas songs sings is particularly painful. albert finney plays pretty well in Annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone's trying to sing through a mouth of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this movie for us was closing the sound and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the South Christmas cd cd.
