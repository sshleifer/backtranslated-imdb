Based on the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. We apologized to them - all four hated us and spent all time looking at our watches waiting for the movie to close. Half of the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes in Paris - for example, I expected to see some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I could not recognize anything. Most of the scene was in a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual movies, do not miss this. If you are on earth like me, you will be sorry to have seen it.
