"Maladolescenza" has the air of a dark fairy tale, the protagonists of his child, the arrangement of the forests and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. However, at its center, the film is essentially an unusual psychosocial study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence using the not so subtle metaphor of Fabrizio's battle with his menacing dog, the film describes Laura's psychological persecution, the girl who has promised his love for him, and his eventual romanticism with Sylvia the same bad. The psychological complexity of the film gives the merit of the film, but there is no doubt as to how useless the film is in its description of nudity and sex. The appearance of the film relies heavily on its gorgeous locations, rather than on special cinematic skill, and there is no doubt that the greatest benefit of the film is the soundtrack of children corrupted in childhood. With a strange dreamlike character, the movie is the best of all, but it slams together with Louis Malle, from the same time, surreal and brilliant "Black Moon." Of course, it deserves debate about art versus pornography, because, unlike many forbidden films, such as "Salo" or "Ken Park" by Larry Clark, the film is rather unimportant from an artistic perspective. The cinema seems to gradually lose its ability to shock, so probably "Maladolescenza" should be admired to retain that power thirty years after its release. However, the value of shock is the only reason the movie is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has defenders. However, the Nazis, too.
