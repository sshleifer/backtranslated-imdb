I've always been curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I hit it on Ebay I went back over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why so rarely! This movie is so bad, so expensive and brilliantly low that ending credits that show all the cut scenes in which they have lost their lines are literally the most important moments of the movie. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, for obvious reason, her topless scene), who uses her powers with an experimental car to draw objects from another dimension into this reality. When he pushes her in a sort of box as an object, the soldiers throw him behind a truck, with a soldier to protect him, and why do you know? SURPRISE! A child in a fuzzy rubber monster suit, immediately removes the soldier with a scratch on his face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploying half of the county's armed forces to find and protect the public, the officers leave Pettyjohn and Ray to find them alone, but no matter how this film casts LONG's credibility before then. This is only avoided by being voted alone with me just because of unintentional laughter, someone has to alert manufacturers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know about it! 2 out of 10, really, REALL bad!
