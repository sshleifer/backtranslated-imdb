When Ritchie broke out for the first time on the film scene, his films were certified as funny, wizarding, well-directed and original. If one could compare the hippies that he generated with his first two attempts and almost total contempt for the last two trips he had created, he should consider - was Ritchie discovered? Is he really so talented? Does it really have original original ideas? Or is it just a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino, and Leone in a colossal and disorganized bunch? After looking at the Revolver, could you be excused that you thought if everything went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and complicated ideas? The revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and succinct, tries to be a smart psychoanalysis, tries to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie is making a gigantic effort to accomplish all these goals, and invests large pieces of script in existential movies and numerous twists and turns. However, ultimately, all that serves is to build an extremely disjointed, unstructured, and extremely unfriendly audience. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie tries at least to give his own spin, he should be punished because he even tried to pass it as his own work. So what the audience finally gets is a terrible scenario intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and left-handed left-handed revolver is finally a gentle and gentle film that has stolen countless masterwork themes such as the Fight Club, Pulp Fiction. His goal is to increase, but inevitably, splendid blows. The revolver deserves to be lambasted, it's a really poor film that acts like a masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. However, she collapses on the farce and fails to everything she wants to be and get.
