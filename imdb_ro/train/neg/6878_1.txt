I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the most serious documentaries I've ever seen of any guy. You can see that the people on it are not clueless. I do not know much about Puerto Rico and about his culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not there. You can see it while it speaks that it contradicts itself. If you want to see a real and true documentary and a genuine documentary from Puerto Rico, then you must see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real document. Not like a piece of junk. Rosie Perez founded this documentary herself. I thought it was Puerto Ricans. He continued to repeat, I did not know. Well, that's the only thing they had in the so-called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of garbage being made with the name of the island. It lowers the standards.
