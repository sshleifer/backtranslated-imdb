Imagine that the true Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a tomb that Carlyle portrayed in this film. No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in 1920. This is just a piece of Hollywood cartoon propaganda, being disguised as "true history." I'm afraid of everyone who believed something from this show. Carlyle and the producers had nothing to do with it. Why did Hitler win so many people, an entire county for his ideas if I were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? Imagining him as a loser, they make their own absolutely unbelievable film. This movie is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important people of the past century. Imagine a movie about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunk for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame and I wonder how an actor like Carlyle could talk in this game.
