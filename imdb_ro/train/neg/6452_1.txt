You know the story. Many kids alone in the woods, when BAM starts to cut them off. Well, this shit is no different. A bunch of kids are returning to a cabin where the man leads twins the brother has disappeared for many years. Obviously, a "CREATURE UNKOWN" sees that they cut them off and their only help is a doctor / biker. To say that this movie was bad is an understatement, it's terrible! The act was horrible. The creature looked very cheese. And as all the movies do these days, they try to bring you with a twist end, which they do not have! There is one bright spot for this movie - star LOST Maggie Grace as female lead.
