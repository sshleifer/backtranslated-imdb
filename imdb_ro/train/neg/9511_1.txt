I wanted to see this movie since it was first published on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see her last night at 7:40. I regret the day I scattered my ticket on this garbage when I could see something better. The beginning was just a bunch of sex and pliers. They have exaggerated how love actually works. All the girls were stereo. The boyfriend was too bad for his age. The past gases that the pregnant woman barely laughed at. The bank robbery was completely boring with the bands that were used in other movies. Their escape was an old Chevy van who claimed to have had no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a nice girly vehicle for the robbery? It may have amplified the public's view of the film. This movie was very low low low low low budget because nothing was damaged or destroyed. This film had a lot of things in it that would lead the people of the Christian people. Hey, I really waited at a car scene, because all the banal robbery films were tracking the car, but I did, but never did. So we rated this b movie, which means low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.
