Why review good movies when you can review "Trancers II?" Ooh, this movie is so lame. I can imagine the distribution and crew that run around L.A. with a video camera, throwing extras in the makeup of a silly monster at Tim Thomerson, a poor, long-lasting. Families of stars are actually returning to play camouflages, probably because Full Moon could not afford extra "real". Lamp effects, blade sets and a so complicated scenario that it would last for eons to unleash all the nodes - this must be Classic Tranquility! And yet ... and yet ... it's regular. Note that this is the same as "Tranches IV". I say this because it is true. What can be watched by an old guy in a ditch jacket, zombies, then chips like: "Do not worry about ladies, are they biodegradable?" Well, a lot of things could be better, but anyway this is still good. My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, which really smells in common. She is a bad rival for Helen Hunt's character - both of them are young eyeballs, and would have been more effective if they contrasted a little more. Well, you can not have everything. At least the awesome plotting plot of "second watch second" is back in place and we have more of Hap Ashby, the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - has a rival form David Ogden Steirs in the "Creator"). I have not seen this lately, but it seems to me that Martine Beswick runs twice during the final battle. Follow for continuity! Just one of the most important moments in this wonderful movie.
