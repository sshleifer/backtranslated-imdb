"Dominique" is one of those films that "slow-like-molasses" must have been invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how often do we see Robertson walking slowly on the stairs, because he can hear someone singing on the piano?). It is ALWAYS redeemed at the end by a surprising twist, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second twist that only manages to leave a bad taste in our mouths. It's not a very nice movie.
