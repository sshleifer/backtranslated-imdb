I found Tremors 4: Legend begins, be boring and boring. All the action scenes were bad. "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern cat, if not smaller. The act was terrible and this movie was just a useless film in the Tremor saga, because even if the story tells how the grabs were formed, the story is so bad and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story back in time, make sure you're using ACTOR ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past when someone is currently in the other Tremor movies ... Geez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time. at Tremors, 1, 2 and 3 for a good period. This movie, however, make sure you are away by standing with you with the STOP button that works for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.
