Even over 20 years later, Ninja Mission is the worst movie I've ever managed to present. The Scandinavian ninja steps silently into a scene, pulls up with the noisy submerging weapons of wild abandon, and then goes silent. Wow, how do we find the invisible silent assassins? Just follow the carcasses of smoke and smoke! The painful bad dialogue (or was it shiny and badly translated?), Not an Asian in view in the distribution, and an impressive total of 3 Asians among the stunt crews. The intrigue is ridiculous, acting pretty much nonexistent - again, the ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid tracking at any price!
