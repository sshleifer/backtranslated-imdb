It's not about gymnastics; change the occasional workouts and it could be as easy as archery, microbiology or a booger-flicking tournament. Instead, like any other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that flooded the market in the 1980s, it's about conquering adversities with a stick-to-itiness, which makes all social / personal realities irrelevant by yourself - Ronald Reagan from the top down, in short; so, as a cinema, there must be details. Some actors are strange enough to make life - especially the love interest brought by anyone other than Mr. Keanu Reeves, who is warming up for Ted; heroin ally's father and grandparent of Olivia D'Abo are more interesting than the sick mother or her / her inerts absolutely inert, one of which seems to be made of porcelain. It is my instinct to be frightened by the black boys, but on the other hand they are at least in the movie. But D'Abo does not persuade her enough and the absence of any other narrative motive, the lack of interest in gymnastics itself is important; it's only bodies that feed around, and not just the result of the big tournament is a foregone conclusion, everything is accomplished by an obvious double.
