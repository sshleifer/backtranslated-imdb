There are pretty pictures of the landscape. The writers put their mouths in the mouth of the actors. With less actors show this show would be stupid. "Art must raise mankind or it is BS". Not so much because the art of all those mentioned is also to blend humanity and express the dark side. The character of lead even tells those who do not drink hid the shadow side. Wrong, he lived in the dark and repressed his dark side by drinking and being a dimensional one that does not extend its horizons with anything but landscapes. There is no respiratory body in his work, nor the expression of his pain. All artists have made it limit itself to a dozen landscapes. Discussions between the characters were class school, the trite things always giving them one of the characters the writer wished. I tried to like after reading all the first comments about wow here. He had to dig deep to see the people we agreed on. I think the big comments were from those connected to the movie. I was only once moved to the end. The child was too passive. The landscape was beautiful and ridiculous music. Just my opinion, but nowhere does it look for me.
