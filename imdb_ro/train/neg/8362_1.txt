This is a very bad movie. I created my brain and can not come up with one positive comment. The act is atrocious. We have seen more credible cable access performance. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the president's secret records, and a shark attacking everything that's approaching should have been doing the rough fun in the worst case. The night of the sharks is not so bad that it's good. The dialog sounds and is broadcast as if it were writing a few seconds before it was filmed. And at first, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am surprised that my ears have not begun to bleed from the techno synthesized sounds of the 80's, which somebody bothered to record. From everything I read, the Italian cinema industry died until 1987. Night Sharks are like a final nail in the coffin.
