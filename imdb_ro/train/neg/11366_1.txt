The first (and only) moment we saw "Shades" was during a Sneakpreview. It was not even the first time. I remember that there was someone in the staff of the directors there, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, I never heard of him, so I was pretty neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and is at mercy before everyone else. He plays an actor, who has been the star for a long time has ceased to rise. He contributes to making a film in Belgium entitled "Shades". As soon as the movie started, I noticed how much swearing there is. Nothing against the occasional oath. However, this was far more than annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone in the distribution, a non-English speaker uses the word F **** or S ***, becomes arrogant and aggressive. We quickly lost the number of times he used the words F and S. Everyone was glad to get out of the theater. And we had to offer a vote, but it was hard for us because it was only 0 to 10 and we were looking for the -10.
