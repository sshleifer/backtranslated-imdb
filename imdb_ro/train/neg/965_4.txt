First of all I liked this movie. It seemed like a nice comedy with stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky has done the best! Just like the wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really tasted really good! But scriptwriters disappointed me very much. The best end would be the scene on the ladder, but instead she decided that her father and daughter should be together. I do not like the end. The father becomes loved by his own daughter, and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it right. It would be good if the writers say for example that there is now a different soul in the body, but they did not, they lacked memories. The actors were good, they were very funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny on the dance scene :))) ... But some moments even ruin the impression of acting well. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, has been expecting him for 23 years (it's been a long time!), True to him, loving anyone, making love to him after a scene with her boyfriend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was screaming for so many years! It would be a good film, if not the end and omission of human psychology.
