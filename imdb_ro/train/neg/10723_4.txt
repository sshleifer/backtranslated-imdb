The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers, in order to punish all those involved in the profanation of his grave. The transfer of the soul makes the young man aging at an extraordinary pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is leaked from those involved in salt. To be as short as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is a rather blurred adventure. While the film does not show a few good, original ideas (which suck the mummy's blood, soul transferential, interesting make-up effects, arm extraction scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and rhythm are very definition going hard. To make things worse, the first 15 relatively short 66-minute runtimes of the movie are nothing more than stuffing. They usually go for these slow-moving mummies, but the Pharaoh's curse is testing my patients as well. The distribution helps very little. With just one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot that wants the movie to focus more on its mysterious character), the distribution is as boring as the script. Finally, I do not know whose idea it was to put the mummy appearance servant into what seems to be pajamas, but it is a ridiculous, ridiculous look for a creature that should instill fear in public. <br /> <br /> Despite my least negative comments about the Pharaoh's curse, I will note 4/10. It's not a good rating to be sure but generous considering all the issues I have with the movie.
