Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice is called because 50% of the movie ... Why? Because it seems that the script and the story have been rewritten as they were shot and have to change their dialogue for the continuity of the story because they have multiple versions. From scratch, you scratch your head, because excesses not only distract, but they do not make any sense. That being said, the story is still aspired and makes no sense. When I came to an end, I just scratched my head because the movie was so useless, and the end did not even make sense. Avoid the plague. This movie made me stop seeing Seagal directly on video because it gets worse and gets worse.
