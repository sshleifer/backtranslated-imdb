I should not even review this movie because it's not a horror movie - and therefore does not deserve the attention of Dr. Cheese. At least, there is no horror in the usual sense. It is certainly a terrible proposition to waste your time watching these nonsense. That's why we stopped it after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that it only took 45 minutes. Yes, it is right; In simple terms, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. The "Order" had a lot of defects, not all unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's refusal to engage Christianity in its terms. It is quite possible to make truly creepy films, which are also Orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just one thing - a smorgasbord of the imagery of the filmmakers (usually boring and illogical). Think. If someone has made an apparent film about, say, about physics, but not just mistaking the fundamental laws of physics, but basing the entire plot on its wrong images, you are soon tired of the useless plot. The same is true for such films. In other words, the "Order" (and many similar films in front of it) invents whole things about the Catholic Church and about Christian faith and testing to build a plot of these inventions. Surprisingly, the plot ends up being incoherent and bad. This movie has the added charm of being just as exciting to watch and as black as it stands. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
