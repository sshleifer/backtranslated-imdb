My husband and I went to see this movie, being fans of the horror movies we are. Two hours later I woke up wishing my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film contain, in principle, the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the movie, other than a good timing on surprise inputs, etc. I found that most of the "frightening" parts are much more fun than anything. After watching other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is considered scary in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save your pain to sit around here. I can not say I would recommend hiring anyone unless you have a free rental to come to you.
