MINOR SPOILERS! Well, I just sat up late and watched this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and evaluated part of Singleton's previous work, "Boyz n the Hood." However, I have to say that this was a great disappointment and it's all I love about controversial, clich√©ful, so-called "messages." <br /> <br /> The act is mainly poor (stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... take notes), situations difficult to swallow (the victim of rape becomes a lesbian overnight ... please!) , but the worst of all this strengthens any deceived stereotype you can think of. In the second half of the film it became cartoon as in its characterization, making you lose any kind of empathy you would have had for unidimensional players. There is only one valid point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. Consequently, it is limited to sensationalizing the results of these problems. The message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of cohesion of parcels. As far as the end of the films is concerned, we found it predictable, embarrassing, exploiting and slightly offensive. For a movie titled "Higher Learning" I have to say all I've learned is to avoid seeing this again. If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this movie fails to fully elaborate then go to rent "American History X" .... unless you were just watching for Tyra Banks then go hiring a life.
