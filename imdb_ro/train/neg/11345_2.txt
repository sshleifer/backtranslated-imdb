That is, the word "pedestrian". It seems the filmmakers have forgotten to have something interesting to happen. Domergue's faith may do better than that. She should be the mysterious, revengeful goddess Cobra ruined by Marshall Thompson's love (an idea, is not it?). Instead, she is a common housewife of the fifties, and the unique, flat-faced expression she carries throughout the movie makes me think they shot it all early in the morning before Faith took the coffee. Regarding the rest of the cast, all are so serious "all Americans" that the result is ridiculous. This is motivated more productively covered by Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think the "Cobra Cult" should really be called "The Cult of the Compulsory Obligation". Why else would it be so many people otherwise talented to do sleepwalking despite a slow, predictable failure like that?
