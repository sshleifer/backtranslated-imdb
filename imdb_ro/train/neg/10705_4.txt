Maverick cop with family trouble and love to use his gun? Check it out! Isolated location with valuable object begging to be stolen? Check it out! Tasteful love interest? Check it out! The assorted band of fools with silly potato cannons with urgent European accents? Check it out! A bad German man, played by an English actor, with a piece of dialogue for each occasion? Check it out! Corny on line? Check! Dear me, does this movie take bee wee or what? Clues come so thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the casting just sits around gawping at how bad the script is! In a cheap and cheeky curse to the video rip off by Die Hard only sitting on a mountain (complete with some square lines from the above), all the usual movements of the action moves are progressively ticked as we go together with some old and old old-fashioned violence and nudity thrown to awaken anyone in the audience that Jack Wild might have is the policeman entirely on John McClane's way that even manages the time for the old bad guy with the gun he used all his bullets Gag at a time. <br /> <In the middle of this mess there are some well-known girls, which they can only assume they need money and / or simply played for laughing from the pointless opening scene that has nothing to do with the parcel through any implausible final conclusion, supplemented by the roupy dialogue and even by the rosier cts effect. Looking at these three pounds of the IMDb matches supermarket effort, I'm surprised to find that this duddy did not give birth to one, but two sequels, I have to find these stones on DVD! It seems the first sequel is a rupture of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, goodness knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with each movie and even the character's name seems to change for the third installment. However, cheap purchases of cheap DVDs would not be the same studios if they did not keep the material from this dreadful quality!
