Director Sidney J. Furie created in Hollow Point an absurd post-modern masterpiece that provokes and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask the question of what is happening with the traditionally traditional tired paradigms of "plotting" and "characterizing" when you remove the crutches of "motivation" and "reason". <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion about him can not be bigger. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, law enforcement agents are unhappy, and organized criminals are crazy.
