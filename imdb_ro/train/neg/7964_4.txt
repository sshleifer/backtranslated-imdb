"Creepshow 2" is slightly more than a pale imitation of the original, designed for purposes other than paying for the name of the previous movie. It amplifies even the defects of his predecessor, which was often predictable and difficult to handle. However, for the first time around, there were plenty of emotions to deal with periodic rest periods, which led to an uneven, but overall, rather fun, effort. The sequel has some valuable moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more evident. From time to time, he offers, but most of the time he just stays there. As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and only desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life, wounding the wounds of his owner's murderers. Adolescents are devoured by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to watch a negligent motorist. None of these premises is inherently bad in itself, but they are devoid of inspiration. There are few surprises and they are not scared. This is an example of an unmotivated shooting manuscript by numbers. This does not contribute to the fact that this inexpensive film suffers from a flat style, although, to be honest, there was not much work to do. Finally, the second story comes better, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, performances are all right at best. George Kennedy, as owner of the general store, has an appropriate job, if not very inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as a motorist tormented by guilt, evoking sympathy for her situation despite the predictable and redundant material. However, most characters are quite thin. <br /> <br /> One would think that Creepshow 2 would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to the screenplay, based on several stories by Stephen King. The makeup effect artist Tom Savini turns into a good gorilla work. So why is the movie a disappointment? I think Romero did not really want to make a second film, but he was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, clone, rip-off, and nothing, so this was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script, hurrying his salary, and running away. I think he had to do what was necessary to finance his own projects; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (from ****) Launched by New World Pictures
