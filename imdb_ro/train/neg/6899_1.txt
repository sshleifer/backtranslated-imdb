Have you ever wondered why the Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humor of American blacks? irrespective of their ethnic origin? Well, this film will not provide answers to this often-thought question - but it will provide an excellent case study. Since its debut, this film acts as an "old school" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, which immediately raises the question of exactly what the purpose of such a task is. Is it meant to perpetuate the rooted stereotypes of the Pacific New Zealanders? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, joking without humor, and the end is expected. This film did nothing for New Zealand cinema because it is just a short, worthless romantic comedy.
