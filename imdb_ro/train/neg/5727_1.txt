I just want to start by saying it's the first review of a movie I made on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading interviews with the director, he says he respects the constructive criticism and therefore I will try to avoid bashing the film just for his sake and give me my opinion on why I thought it was so terribly catastrophic . /> 1. Actors. I know the budget would not have allowed big audiences, but with Nicholson who has been working in industry for over ten years he certainly knew some actors who were at least average. Incredible blades and special effects. Once again, the budget has obviously intervened in what it initially intended, but after working on it for so many years, there is no excuse. Obvious looks like the Hostel. While it's not exactly a rupture, it's definitely trying to regain the success of former movies. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... 4. Music. Not at all frightening or haunted, not even hurting annoyingly. <br /> <br /> 5. Scenario in general. All the dialogue was forced and terrible! Also, the sub-plots about the theater and the guy who comes to save them were weak and almost like a later idea. <br /> <br /> 6. Edit. WTF. How disturbing and not in a good way. nuf said. Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (no doubt, go to IMDb's pages), because buddy ... what were you thinking about? Surely at some point during filming or editing, you figured out what a turkey yol had in your hands ... I'm sorry I do not want to be harsh, but you have to have more talent than we hope the next your feature is that the movie or gutterballs wahtever is better, hopefully practice makes progress. But, at the same time, avoid that, like the plague. I want 81 minutes back with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch her.)
