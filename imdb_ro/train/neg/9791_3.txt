Basically, it's about a couple who wants to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt it. If you think this is bad, hold it, because it gets worse. Stuart arrives in his new home where he is treated as a human child. (The rest!) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché, the family problems, the jealousy of the biggest "brother", and finally all the problems are solved and they are all a "happy family". Boring and worn, as it happens, is presented in the most blunt and less sophisticated way. I do not know if the director thought he was creative by putting a mouse in the cliché, or he only tried to complete in a few minutes but only improved the cliché from the boring to the disgusting. Then why did I give a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of funny concerts, where Stuart uses his small size well. Generally, I think the movie would function reasonably if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "brother". b. It was fun at the fun, as if Stuart had tried to overturn the cat and left dull clichés that did not match anything else.
