This movie is one chiche long after another. First of all, although they have done their part, there is an inappropriate drug scene in which John smiles the weeds like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is the wizard, envious, the homosexual wardrobe, Yoko's slave, portrayed as being in a book discredged by Albert Goldman. Even keeps the title of singing in the usual conversation "it's always been just two of us"! John would not have been so bad for his fans like that. Like his death, he showed us that it was too nice if something else. The only funny scene is if a crazy Beatle fan just recognizes John and asks him to sing to Paul yesterday. An insulting John says something along the lines: "Sure and while I crown why do not you get down on your knees, put your wife's wig, and lick my liggin." That made me laugh for days. Indeed this movie is funny in how serious it is trying to be while it comes out of ridicule. John and Paul did not stand pontificating all day, they were funny guys of light, who even during The Beatles broke up where they were more personalized and then portrayed here. Forget.
