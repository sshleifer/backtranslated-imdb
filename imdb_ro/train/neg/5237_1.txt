One of, if not the worst, film that came out of the UK in the 80s. This wicked story of a middle-aged teenager who "seduces" two adolescent scrubs who take care of him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem. , puerile, blurry and unrealistic, this film leads the depths, because it fails strangely in its attempts to be fun, challenging, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Maybe the worst thing about this movie is how the strong distribution of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely sewn on such a blade scenario. No wonder it was the only work of the young Andrea Dunbar who made it on screen. Complete and total garbage at each level.
