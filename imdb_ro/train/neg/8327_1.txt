O.K. So it's a low budget movie (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). The act is universally horrible, the makeup is ridiculous (the blood seems to come from Sherwin-Williams and I have seen more convincing bruises made by Halloween ghouls) and the illumination generally shows that they used a pickup car taken someone to shine the headlights from the actors. I may be able to forgive these low budget features if there was real content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of videos can boast of no plot, no real character, no impulse. It's a self-indulgent mess. And do not worry - you do not have spoilers here, because there is nothing to spoil.
