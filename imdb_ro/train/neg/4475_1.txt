terrible, just awful! my old roommate used to track this junk and took me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never know what it is because their first impressions are from dribbling like this one. they have changed so much that they are hard to recognize. who defies me because the book reads as a digging anyway, offering enough fodder for modern entertainment. is like one of those life-long movies that say "based on a true story," but they are completely fictional. there is no excitement or depth of the book, just the mindless melody. if you are a high school student looking for a way out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
