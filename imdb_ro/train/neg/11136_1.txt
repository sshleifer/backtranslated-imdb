This is only the second time that I felt compelled to comment on imdb about a movie. The first time was for probably the best movie I've ever seen and that was for Memento. Seeing that Darkwolf is at the other end of the ladder, compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've had the misfortune of seeing. Apart from the two scenes containing naked women, there is nothing in this movie that will pick it up from the garbage bin that is. Let's see, calling effects, cliche script, bad action and about 90 minutes long. My wife and I mostly laughed with mistrust in how bad. Amazingly I looked to the end, as I did, I do not know! AVOID!!!
