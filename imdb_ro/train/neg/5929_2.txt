People who appreciate this film are real disappointments - I hope at least that Leonard sees something good of it because his life savings have been hijacked by a manager a few years ago and now he is over 70 years old. But this movie is simply terrible. At first, Leonard himself says he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next hour and a half the film highlights all the sentimental elements of Leonard's song. It is so bloody PRECIOUS, with its thriving prison of singers dealing with emoting. Cohen's interview is done in lo-fi video and I wanted to see a medium or long shot of his whole body! I would not care less about the commentators' performers, especially those exaggerated ego boys, Edge and Bono. None of the performers in this movie made even a melody as good as Leonard's music, and if you think about seeing this and have some doubt, listen to them. It would be a specially acceptable PBS, perhaps, for a presentation. But I really hesitate to get a DVD about it. When the film finally shows Leonard's semi-performing "Song Tower" is ruined by Bono by taking a verse. Even occasional performances (Antony, Rufus' first issue, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turbulent burglar. Watch this and go buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay him a tribute.
