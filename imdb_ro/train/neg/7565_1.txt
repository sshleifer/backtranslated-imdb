This movie is the biggest loss of nine dollars I spent in a very, very long time. If you know how often I went to movies you probably would have said, it's hard to imagine, but never, it's true! After I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why not? Trailer is nothing less exciting and exciting; unfortunately, the movie is none of these. From cinema, script, to acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you read this, you plan to go to the movie waiting for some emotion, mystery, action, horror or something other than a one-hour and forty-five-hour loss, I'm afraid you're disappointed. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you might ask. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor suspicious. Nothing about the film made me at least "farther," frightened or curious. The script was the best. There have been countless times throughout the film in which the dialogue was so ridiculous that I began to write it as a comic amusement just to find out a few seconds later that it was not like that. The act was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but it was a wish. Exceptionally, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinema was terrible, without a moment of suspense or mysticism. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away. I'm not usually a very tough critic. Frankly, when I go to see a comedy, I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, acting badly, writing badly and overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
