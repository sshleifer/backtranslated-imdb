I often fail to write comments, but that's why, just to warn someone who might think they are watching, will see a comedy. This is not approaching. While the premise (change of color / sex / everything) is pretty bad (and it was done better, many times before), the real transformation of two black guys into two white faces is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on the screen. It would be quite bad if all that was required of the script was a change in white chicks. However, the Wayans must hide as two specific white women. As you have guessed so far, they fail completely. I have seen queens of love without making makeup to make women more convincing than the two with the best special effects and makeup that Hollywood can offer. It's scary. Add to the mixer a basketball player built like a building, a terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course, and this movie strikes a new personal level. And I like bad movies! Avoid the plague.
