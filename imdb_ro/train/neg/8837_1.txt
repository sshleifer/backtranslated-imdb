This movie is terrible. I was really looking forward to it, as I thought "Lantana" was great. The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, good things: look good, some of the shows are OK. Bad things are anything else about it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you probably know, is about blocks that move and uncover a body with the twists they find on Friday but continue to fish and eventually report it on Sunday when they return in the mobile range (mobile phone). However, the film takes time (the boy spends his time) reaching this central event. From the ensemble of characters (about a dozen), no one seems to enjoy another (which is, I suppose, consistent, because all is impossible to achieve). I was extremely frustrated by the failure to properly explain how the characters are related, and it was not until the end of the movie that we could vaguely build the genealogy tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a movie that we've met really grim, which is a failure in the story structure, because the life of the character seems just as bad before the fishing trip as after. Once you set the bar so high, it's hard not enough for everyone to commit suicide. There are foolish losses in logic. The killer throws the body into the lake and then somehow moves upstream into the mountains. The fishermen leave Sunday morning, but for some reason, Byrne returns home late at night after his wife has gone to bed. Then the following morning the police hit her door to make him down to the station. Did not they hear about the phone? Down to the radio station, does the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after reporting the body? In total, the disappearance of the story is the debate with which the blocks certainly had after finding the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how could you do that?" and the audience asks the same question. (The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to go to the car, go to the mobile area, call the cops, wait and guide them back to the place. If the others wait at the camp and fish, who cares? Many of these seem false. The only thing I saw was that, as the little girl was, local locals were confronted with the actions of fishermen as racists - "she would not have done it if she were a white girl." <br /> <br /> Over time, there is a curious indifference to who could have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned only once) and there is no mystery because the audience sees the killer in the scene opening. <br /> <br /> <br /> So I stand there at once bored and confused when there is a twist - not in the plot, but the theme. Suddenly, it refers to the quiet dignity of absent aborigines, which leads to an absurd end, with some incoherent things about black and white reconciliation. That's the Australian movie "at its best," according to The Age.
