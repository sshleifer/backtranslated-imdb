How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel NOT fun in this? Believe it or not, "House Bunny" has done this better and funnier. We hope the directors have had a good vacation and have received some money - this movie is a jena for all. It is a cliché from the beginning to the end. Clichés can work well with a scenario, or at least one idea. This film only uses cliché after cliché, rather than ideas or scenarios. Use the preexisting characters of the actresses, rather than develop characters. Bad, sad and garbage. Now it seems that it must have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT manager, this is another example of unwanted encoding.
