This movie is probably pro-muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives the first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the movie, he seems to be a Muslim because of his shirt, he has kept his amulet and his general clothes. He has a six-year-old child wearing the same clothing and is therefore probably a Muslim, though his mother is a Christian. Therefore, the main character chooses to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male characters who are Christians seem to create a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, so it seems.
