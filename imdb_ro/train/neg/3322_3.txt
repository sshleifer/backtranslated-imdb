Unfortunately for me, Busby Berkeley's first film, which I watched, was "42nd Street". Then I waited for all things to be so good. I found out that this was not necessarily the case, not even here, with my classic favorite actor, James Cagney. Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many of the other and quite tedious. Apparently it always implies the producers of unfortunate performances. In this movie, it's Cagney, who is spinning by shouting things so often that he gives me a headache after a while and his character bears thin ... fast! Even the songs here are anywhere near 42th Street, songs that you could scratch for years and years - decades, I would say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of Cagney's few early movies - and the Berkeley films - I do not like it at all and I was very disappointed to look.
