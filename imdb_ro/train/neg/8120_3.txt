At least among the films with 100 votes or more. Nominated for Best Screenplay Writing Directly? Brenda Blethyn has been nominated for best actress in a lead role? Nominated for Best Picture? I always disagree with many of Oscar's plays, but the movie could be the worst film of all time to be honored by the Academy. Writing and interpretation were so horrible. Blethyn's performance, in particular, was one of the worst I've ever seen and probably the highest performing performance of all time. The horrific film, not worthy of the big screen and worthy of any television or television channel that has ever played, including HBO (where I've seen it). I'm just grateful that I do not actually pay to see one of the most exaggerated movies of all time.
