Generally, I like dinosaur movies, but this is a pure carp. No scenario, no dialogue, no action. Courageous Colonel Rance, trying to show him that it's hard and his mouth resembles a twin brother the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So it was a complete waste of time (fortunately we do not waste money, as we saw the movie on TV). And I really can not understand 7 people who classified this guy. 10 They probably joked. My advice if you see this title run from it!
