First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. The biggest bag of carp ever. At first, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who is angry at a comedy building called Apollo. On his way home from a concert, as he goes on a bicycle, he sees that this woman likes and is hit by a truck. A little later, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then she dressed as the Outkast music band as she tried to play the original scene, where she came out as Jockey. Secondly, he returns to Apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to find in his earlier body and begins to conceal the white population and tries to be black. Are you letting me go? This movie is terrible that it is trying too hard to be the original and in this process comes as a bag of nonsense. Take my advice, do not even watch this movie.
