I just looked at The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first looked at it. I do not understand why it became such a "classic cult" when it is so boring. The opening scene seems promising when the fat assistant throws the blood box and goes for her dear life. After that, everything that really happens is the man who melts around forests and houses, while he has retrospectives of his life as an astronaut. Makeup is pretty good, and its melting look seems quite realistic. There is a refreshing scene in which he throws a mans head in a river and floats until he lands in a cascade where he falls on the rocks and opens. It's not too much to get wet, however, most scenes are shot in the dark and you do not really see what's going on. There are not too many ghosts, at least in the Vipco DVD I've been watching. <br /> <br /> No, the incredible Melting Man is not great at all. I'll give you notes about the cheese factor, but that's about it. If you want a true SF / SF classic, watch The Deadly Spawn!
