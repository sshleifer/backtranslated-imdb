I mean, the act is bad, but I guess it was the direction that did so. I did not think too much about Highlander (the same director), but someone could be blamed in the 80's. But she has no apology. People are shot while going out of the trenches with a man in front of him! These mistakes, together with an unclear time line, strange fighting tactics, sub-haircut, and bad visual effects, make it a sub-par. commented, all this American shit. The German general is basically afraid of his captured American private. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, though in small doses. To summarize, a movie that is not horrible, but surely sub-war war in all aspects.
