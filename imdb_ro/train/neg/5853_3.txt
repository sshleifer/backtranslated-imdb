IMMORTALIZER was interesting. He certainly did not kill me in the hour and a half, but he did not even impress me at all. A group of children are kidnapped in an alley of muscle mutants (in a scene with the least convincing effect of the cinema) and are taken to a fabulous house in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Divine and his team carry out brain transplants for their rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this has been remodeled quietly with a large budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplanted an old man's brain into another body, would their new voice sound like their old voice? With all this discussion of the pineal glands and the use of a bright green serum, you can almost see visions from BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing at the head of the producers. But production does not have the courage to take it out. I never understood why, when someone makes a horror film, they do not pack it at the edge of the gore frame. The actress is evenly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as assistant Dr. Price. She has a pretty bad laugh. The only thing to note about IMMORTALIZER is that it has a lot of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious shots for the elderly.
