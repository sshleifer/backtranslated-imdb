There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was expecting Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones to die. This was, in principle, a woman's show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to offer her candy eyes. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he had no role. The film was also Lily Taylor (Ransom, ready to wear). She was the only one who had a real role in this script by David Self. OK, it was his first and he was redeemed with Road to Perdition. I do not know what was the problem with director Jan de Bont. has done a very good job with Speed ​​and Twister. really fell to work here. Maybe it is recovering from the disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for Wild Wild West, otherwise he would be the worst image since 1999. Avoid at all costs.
