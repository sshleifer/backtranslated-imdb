Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the United States and other countries, and I went to see DisneyNature's full-featured Earth Movie. I think, like car makers, Disney is trying to convince us she cares about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it guarantees a special unity with the word "nature" in it. I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse and who am I to tell my personal feelings about Disney a year? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible cinema, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Previed by half a dozen Disney movie clips, full of Disney clich√© ("circle of life", "falling in style"), extremely dramatic music, recycled material (Disney claims "40% new images"). I began to think that James Earl Jones' story became a little dull. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman, who makes every tale of Warner Brothers, starts to be slim. I really thought that Disney had bought a photograph of the BBC nature that was so spectacular, they felt it would sell if it had slammed some orchestral music and sound bites recognized on it. And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators watching and killing baby animals? There were half a dozen of such scenes, completing with the young boys about to destroy their throats. I think Disney has to admit that the animals have a rich and exciting life outside the life and death battles that draw the attention of action-oriented adolescents who were dragged by this film by their parents. I was also aware of how Disney stopped realizing that man had to deal with climate change. Am I so afraid of a small minority of deniers that I think it's still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend you to skip this and rent the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature's movies seem to be the best made by the British at this time.
