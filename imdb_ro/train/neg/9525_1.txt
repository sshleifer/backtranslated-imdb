This absolutely boring, meaningless, meaningless, mindless and crazy movie is not the final proof that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his post-movies Trainspotting: "Beach" has already taken care of it. What makes this low-budget strange thing is to ensure its place among those who have started very well, but have been completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-deception, bad leadership or anything else that has led to extinction this director of the past. The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet together and spontaneously start singing with a fervor closer to the crazy asylum inhabitants than a possible duo hit - which they do. A friend of theirs - an even bigger, illiterate loser - becomes their manager by destroying a shop window and stealing a video camera by filming them in "action" and then showing the band of music people who are actually interested in this garbage work. Now, I know that in the last few years Britain has unleashed an incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; music makes Oasis look like The Beatles. During the recording of the studio, duo - Strumpet - changes the lyrics every single moment and Ecclestone tells the arrogant guy of biz to take it or leave it, and even absurdly, I take it. Not only music is total and total, but "performers" are antisocial; these NEWCOMERS should call the photos. It's too bad. It's just terrible. Dialogue is inoperative and does not go anywhere, and this story between ducks and puppies is pointless and meaningless. He often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of garbage is so bad it's embarrassing to look. Ecclestone's I.Q. must also be questioned because he has agreed to be part of this nonsense. Anyone who funded this 1000 pound joke could leave the film before selling their own lingerie in the street corners.
