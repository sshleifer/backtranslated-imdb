I want to say first that I am a Christian (and that I work in the cinema and television industry), so I understand how to work on a feature film so as to be grateful for that. They are all for positive, elevating messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have positive reactions, so positive, to the Christian message; for me it was just that execution is where the movie fell. A film lives and dies on its story, and here you have unique stereotypes, aplenty exhibitions and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicable to say at least. I think a movie does not have to shake your head with your message to get the point. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. will improve with time, and there will also be storytelling methods. Perhaps they could direct someone else's script as their next project. * Sports videos are not really my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire in a multitude of ways. If you are interested in a movie with a PG rating that inspires, give Steven Soderbergh "King of the Hill" a look. All truth is the truth of God ...
