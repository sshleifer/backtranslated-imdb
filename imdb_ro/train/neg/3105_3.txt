I can not believe anyone can make a comedy about a problem, such as lack of shelter. Of course, Brooks did not make a comedy about homeless people. There is no mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat quite often. Brooks' movies have worsened over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
