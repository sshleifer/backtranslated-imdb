To make a good movie, you need excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of the two. In this eye of the needle we have none. I do not even remember the director's name. He did not have to do much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he absolutely can not be the main actor in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie when it appears for up to 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was excellent in JFK by Oliver Stone when he spoke to Kevin Costner on a park bench for 10 minutes non-stop, not even taking a breath. Wonderful. But Sutherland being the main actor in a movie is not good. Kate Nelligan? It is probably good for TV series. The DVD is terrible. Terrible colors. Terrible light. Nor could I appreciate Storm Island's landscape for how bad the photo was. This story of Ken Follett was good, but it is a pity to make him an uninteresting film.
