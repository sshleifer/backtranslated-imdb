Final Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> *** Possible Scene-Specific Spoilers (but who the hell cares) *** Yes, that's right: zero. And rarely give it 1. Even the brightest movies are looking for music, cinema, imagination, humor, even a good rhythm to be as objective as possible the score. Looking at him within his own generations or subgenera. But there is absolutely nothing redeeming here. I do not remember another moment when a movie sent me to go up and down the room when it's over. The only reason I got to the end was that I could not change the channel - I was simply restless, looking to see how strangely messy it is to come up with the next one. It was like seeing a snake rip a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and pull it out, do not we? First of all, there is nothing technical about the "Beat" that works. Visuals are all in sitcom style. Scanned scenes are just the street traffic photos that pass over night overnight. Music and score, not only do nothing to the film - is unpleasant. Let me not say that she has nothing to contribute to this. The actress is just as cardboard, around Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who received this train in the green). These guys, supposedly good friends, no longer have chemistry or feelings of intent if the director Peter M. Cohen rounded them to a bus station a few minutes before shooting. On the creative side, an original bone in his body. He has no imagination. He does not show us anything I have not seen thousands of times before. The whole premise or "twist" of this film is based on bashing and the "idea" that an empowered woman can play men "just as they are playing." Anyone who thinks it is a kind of twist or somehow original, has never seen a TV before. Frequent, superficial women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It does not steal anything specifically, it's worse: steal from the clich√©. I can not imagine a woman making a film that described other women based on both stereotypes and this sense of contempt. It makes me want to go hiring "In The Men's Company" - or better, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be a "more beautiful" version of "It's about Mary" so bad you can see sweat. The film has no knowledge of women, men, encounters, sex, or anything. Cohen is simply pleased to regroup the myths he has been indoctrinated from other sexist films. At the other end, the film does not even work like a satire, because although it is ripe with exaggerations that you might see as "satirical," it does not have that earth in reality that needs satire. He does not even know what satirization. Then there is the dialogue, which is a little more than the characters screaming obscenities to each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k voi" Character 2: "Oh yes, good f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, which could excuse all other discretions : There are a lot of films without plots without a good attitude, with morally reluctant characters and obscene dialogue that were funny and therefore good. "Beat" is not funny. Not for a second. She has no comic skills or calendar. Situations are completely false, they are not based on any truth, especially enough to laugh at us. Characters all drawn in a broad sense, so SEEM relative to the smallest of the lowest common denominator. Look at the "scene marquee", "classic worship" hair gel scene. One of our anti-hero heroes opens the drug booth and sees the Mene (Peet) vibrator. For some reason, the light shines on it as though it were the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks people are reacting to vibrators I do not know. While rubbing it on himself, he throws it in the toilet and then tries to catch it with her bare hands when she, Mena, enters it. Oh, my parts. <br /> <br /> But, strangely enough, people really like this movie. Of course, people also enjoy "Friends" and dating relationships so that I'm not surprised. All of these have a common thread. "Whipped" is a great proof to me that there's only a huge pocket of people in America who will laugh at any joke just because it's about sex. They will want any show or film (or I think they like it) just because it's about meetings or relationships. The lack of any quality has no effect on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want their white teeth and thinner bodies to sell haircuts and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to try to create spelling / relationship with their sellers without TV, free and effortless movies. <br /> <br /> The only advice will be that when I die, because I saw this movie, I have a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br />
