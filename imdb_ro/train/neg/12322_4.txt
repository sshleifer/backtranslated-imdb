As it seems to be the general taste of these comments, the movie has an amazing animation (I've seen it on blu-ray), but it really has no real depth. First, the characters are pretty boring. I have a clue about Laputa between Agito, Toola and the main Shunack antagonist. However, maybe my mind has gone astray, and this was a desire to think (Laputa being my favorite animation, the original Engilsh dub). The characters are not at all attractive and, as mentioned in another post, they fall in love very quickly, leaving the jealous Minka jealous and rejected (loves Agito, who seems to forget that). However, she seems promptly to forgive Toola at the end of the year without explanations for heart change, otherwise it makes the end a bit "happier." <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanations. As a matter of fact, who are the druids? Are they people? and what are strange women / girls that seem to stay with them and lead the forest? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how to provide regular human superpowers. Plants coming from the Moon still do not fill the gaps about it. It's almost like a strange version of Triphid Day. And who calls it Toola? why bother doing this if it is not explained? I really wanted to like this movie, but I found the plot not if almost as deep as a movie like Ghost in Shell or who have any real character like those in Miyazaki. I do not bother to see him, but I do not want to buy it. My advice? Let him go if you have a few hours at his disposal but borrow it or buy it cheaply! Perhaps if your new movies at anim√© and have not much to go, you will enjoy. It is certainly visually enjoyable.
