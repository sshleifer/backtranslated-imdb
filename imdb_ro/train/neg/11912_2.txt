The story behind this movie is very interesting and, in general, the plot is not that bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, rhythm, sequences of action, stunts, and CG use all cherish and destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> First, action sequences. All are quite inexplicable. Most consist of someone who gets up and shoots without trying to run, fight, escape or anything else, even if they have all the time in the world. Sequences seem to be steady for something done in 2004. The CG has very well-played and animated effects, but they come from cheap search because of the way they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: Everything is happening too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a few hours, and can back-flips from the beginning. Why is it so acrobatic? None of these is explained in the film. Like Lilith, he should not have been able to turn back - maybe he could not, since he had wings. We also have sequences like a woman who ran by car, getting up and simply wandering into a deserted room with a sink and a mirror, then stabbing in the throat for no apparent reason and without any the spectator to take care that he was just hit by a car then felt the side effects of another exploding car) ... "Are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, I'm fine," she says, bloody and disturbed. However, I have seen everything because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, poor performance made me want anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, even that vampire movie where Jackie Chan was a funny fun because they managed to suspend my mistrust, but that made me want to shake the awake director giving the writer a good discussion.
