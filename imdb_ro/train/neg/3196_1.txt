The only words you have to do more than Joe Don Baker if you're thinking about watching a movie are Greydon Clark and if they're both there, run for your life. Still, this is a very funny movie, because they take it seriously! Beginning bad and falling down, repeat scenes, The Good The Bad and The Ugly Like Shootout will make you roll on the floor with laughter. Yeah, she's the best Deputy Sheriff in Texas, watching a mafia hit by the mob in Malta just as he can. He makes his own rules, doing things on his own, always wearing cowboy boots and cowboy style. Want to see a bad but funny movie? Go on, move!
