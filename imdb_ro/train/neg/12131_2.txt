Kevin Spacey is very talented, but the director, unfortunately, is not his force. I had great expectations about the movie before hiring me and maybe that's why I did not like it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that takes place mostly in a small frame, but it is not the test that matters. I found the boring, boring and stretched movie. The actor was not spectacular. Gary Sinise did much better, especially because he is aware of most of his films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I made a shot from how young and brutish she was watching this Scream star). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the only shot of the top car wreck. The central line of the road was perfectly centered and the room moved along the line and passed the wreck. However, that shot was very "The usual suspect," and my assumption is that Spacey got the idea from his previous movie (which is great for you). If you want to see a fabulous movie taking place in a small frame, watch Hitchcock's rescue boat. Maybe Spacey should have looked at her before filming this.
