.. THIS IS NOW! Very good premiere, even on bats. Has a first excellent scene, must give credit if the credit is due. It has solid characters and a fairly decent script for a ghost story, but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the ghosts appeared, what I liked very much on the road; how it was, how it looked ... the only thing was the ghost relationship. Because of the way things happened in the first scene, you think their dynamics would be different. Things have slowed a bit too much in the middle I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT then the end is actually really good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically said the same story with a polished lens, but no samurai and that I liked with this comparative film. Please, someone with a temperate style remake this movie. /> <br /> The fans of "Silent Rage" would love this movie.
