The second attempt by an intellectual in New York in less than 10 years to create a Swedish film - the first being Susan Sontag's "Brother Carl" (made in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less! ) Results? Oscar Wilde said best, referring to Dickens' "The Old Curiozity Shop": "One should have a heart of heart to not laugh aloud at the death of Little Nell." Quite the same thing here. "The interior" is full of solemn murderers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking in the middle of the distance: "I do not like who I am." Bergman's directorial quotes (to use a polite term) are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family reminds us how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("I read your poem the next day, it was in - I do not know - The New Yorker." "Oh, it was an old poetry, I reopened it.") Far from taking care of these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the funny things in Allen's earlier films - only he directed his actors to play the straight lines. After being born in the movie, poor poor Mary Beth Hurt cops all her neurotic tics, intonations, and habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). /> The basic plot - the dysfunctional family with the quiet dominant mother - seems to be lifted more or less by Bergman's "Winter Light", the melodrama of the basic family betrayed with much existential agitation. Everything happens in the visual / auric tricks put up for sale: the sharpening of a pencil on paper, the elderly surf that bore people walking on the beach. etc., etc. Allen later "serious" movies are less embarrassing, but also much less of the entertainment. I'll take the "Inside". Woody rarely made a more funny movie.
