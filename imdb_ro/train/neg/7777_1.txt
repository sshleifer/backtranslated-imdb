This could be a nice movie for kids My nephew followed once. he watched her the second time I followed him. When the little bear is lost on ice and is in the water, he tries to get to a piece of ice. "I do not want my nephew 3 years old to see movies with words like this." for the children. It should be child friendly. That's what I expected. taken out by the warrior brothers and G rated I would expect this to have no strange words in it. Words do not match the movie in most places, as it seems to be added later. And the film breaks in many parts.
