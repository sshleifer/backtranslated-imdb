If you do not understand the miserable excess, this movie will not mean much to you. An attempt has been made to interfere with humanity in a cold and bleak period of alcohol and drugs - it does not work. When Salma Hayak makes her the big number of disco, her voice is so obvious she said it's pathetic - the producers could at least have gotten someone who dialed her remotely like her. The documentary that has played on television lately is far superior and offers a much more real vision of that period of our history. No one, except Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an incredible job.
