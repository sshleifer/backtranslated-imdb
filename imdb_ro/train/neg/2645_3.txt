The final bets of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald are essentially a complete error. The script is poor and was poorly presented. The film has no life in it. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better to make a concert for the end There's nothing wrong with their singing but just about anything else in this turkey that's too messy.
