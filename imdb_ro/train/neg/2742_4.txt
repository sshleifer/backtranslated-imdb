I just happened to get caught up on this surfing movie channel. my first reaction was: "God, not again!". is so hip to play a delay these days has become pretentious and sincerely clever. for some reason, however, I stayed and watched it until the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping it would give me something to tell. Surely ken and helena can act. the film also progresses into something better towards the end and actually makes a point. helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character. jane has an average side he uses to keep distance and reject pity. then again she has a soft part that only seeks love. the only thing that surprised me more was the character of branagh ... it was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing unique. see if you're a secondary student ... if you're looking for pure entertainment you can jump over it. sean penn serios! oh, that was a bit harsh, has a series of jokes ... but not for escapists.
