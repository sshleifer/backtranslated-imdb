Misleading advertising ... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power, which says, "From Scarface and Carlito Way," Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, it was actually " editing room assistant "for Scarface. Do not take Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have a lower class. I think I can talk to the masses when I say ... We like to be lying. As for the movie, it was the weakest in the best case. I thought Puff Dad did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be ashamed of working on this film. Overall, this movie did not make a good job completing the fields for Carlito's Path. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make a quick buck, rather a good movie.
