No, there's nothing about this story with the pumpkin coach, the fairy nightmare and the glass slippers, but if I worked out, I should have broken it for you, which I will not do. But do not let your curiosity make you better, because this movie is not fantastic. It's one of those movies that begins with the promising before they betray their audience with cheap tactics and an incoherent story. And that's real horror. Yoon-hee (to Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful surgical surgeon, while your other teenage daughter, obedient and beautiful. Their relationship is like a handful, so close to think of them as brothers rather than parent-child. But things start to deceive (not always) when the friends of Hyun-soo, which Yoon-hee operated, are starting to berserk. Perhaps it is a warning to the public and to those ladies in Korea who do not knock an eyelid when it comes under the knife, if it is supposed to be news. The only really scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, although I realized that Kim Ki-duk's time actually had more gore when describing and describing what happens during surgery. two halves, the fist being an attempt to shock the audience with standard scary tactics, which, I admit, came to me from time to time. However, the second half degenerated the movie into a mumbo-jumbo mindless melodrama and was quite controversial in forcing his ideas on his neck. Some things start to make no sense, and while the attempts are always presented to explain them, you probably will not buy them, not that horror films are logical to get started. there is a distinct lack of male presence in the role of a negligible policeman. But, hey, I'm not complaining, though the story could have been greatly improved. I recommend you to look at this only if you are a fan of Korean mediocre horror on VCD. Watch out for those moments in front of you!
