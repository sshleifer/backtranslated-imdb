I rented this in the '80s and honestly I do not remember anything about the movie - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was fun." This is not one of those "it was so upsetting, it leaves you with a bad feeling." Not even one of them was "what the hell was that?" movies. I do not remember the performance of the actors, but it was badly shot, the story was split and it did not have a defining style. When it's over, I'm upset that we've lost time. I've seen a lot of movies I did not understand because of cultures, styles and / or unfamiliar stories, but it was clear that these movies had some of these properties. The incubator has none. I actually thought not to comment on this "play" for fear that someone might look at it out of curiosity, but I have to warn someone who appreciates the movie to skip this movie.
