Wonderful distribution was scattered on a worthless scenario. Ten adults gather at the summer camp where they participated as minors. Could this happen in a million years? It's just a fantasy and a boring one. Have they become teenagers again? Are they resurrecting their fights, games, good times? They can try, but ultimately the answer is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any suspense? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How can someone have fun with this feeling is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
