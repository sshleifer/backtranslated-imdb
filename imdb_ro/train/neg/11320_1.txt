someone had to pay a car ... this is really terrible ... it makes Jean Claude's cyborg seem to have gone with the wind ... this is an hour I would like to sue to come back ... unfortunately it caused severe somnolence ... from which I fell asleep. how can the actors of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend my time looking at my algae growing on the side of a fish tank than taking part in this terrible preparation of a different kind. Now I use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at Walmart is far too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have to have it, wait until you throw it away after you have been carrying it on the inventory for many years and you are frustrated that you will not sell it. br /> <br /> Please for the love of God let this film die of obscurity.
