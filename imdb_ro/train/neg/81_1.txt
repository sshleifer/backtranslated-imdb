Life has succeeded again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait to finish. The plot was meaningless. The act was terrible! Especially by adolescents. The story was played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give the actors a job? The previews were appealing and we were really looking for a good thriller. With a long life comes with a good film, it is not one of them. If you have nothing else to do, I would have avoided at all costs. It was a two-hour loss of my life. Can I bring them back? I'd better have scratched my face against a brick wall for two hours, then watered it in peroxide. That would have been more fun.
