In 1976, the West was an exhausted genre, and the producers of this film knew it very clearly. However, instead of refining the project and saving us from being forced to follow it, they continued and did it anyway. They seem to need an interesting thread to get the audience to come and see the movie, they have decided to make it so flagrantly violent and unpleasant. Damn it worked for The Wild Bunch, why should not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch has enjoyed a gorgeous scenario, but The Last Hard Men scenario is an old fashioned trash. It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to those roles. Heston plays a retired lieutenant who goes after a bunch of convicts convicted of a violent villain (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by condemned and subjected to sexual degradation. It's really a blood-thirsty film, where every time someone dies, the top details. It is really disappointing indeed, because the pair of stars sounds like a mouth-watering perspective. There's no sense of rhythm or urgency in the movie, either. It takes an eternity to go, but when the action finally comes, it is marked by the emphasis on the instinct. Generally, it could be the worst movie that Heston ever did. I'm sure he's one of the productions he does not like to include in his illustrious CV.
