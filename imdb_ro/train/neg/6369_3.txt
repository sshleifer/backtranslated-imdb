The only reason we rented this was because of Fangoria magazine article. The article made this movie look interesting. Well, it is not. This was a very boring film, written and directed by amateurs. All the actors in this movie are terrible, except for Faye Dunaway, which is always a joy to watch. But for too long he focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a strong Argentinean accent, you can only understand every word he says. He is also on the feet of Nicholas Pauls, who plays a special interest for Gina Phillips. Bottom Line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and this is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given a star, but I gave her three, because I like so much Faye Dunaway. But it was not even that big.
