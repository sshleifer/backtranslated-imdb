The best thing about this is at least fresh: almost no movie about dance music and club scene (even if it was made) hit the cinemas. And he also radiates a lot of energy, from music to the portrait of Ibiza. But the main problem is that he can not decide what he wants to be. Although he certainly likes to be a mockumentar on This is Spinal Tap line, decision makers have realized he would not want to play copied. However, he does not do great jokes because he is not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And he has no bow in his script and directs to reach 90 minutes, so why not edit it at 75? The Production and Cinematography Department is still trying to save the day (for example, Paul's house). In a weird and unexpected way, everything is gone. Pete Tong works much better than a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous. Especially scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer a power of action. Conclusion: It's a mess, it's having some fun at a basic level, but it's better to spend a night in your favorite club.
