This should be re-titled "The curious case of non-cruel filming that featured an unmitigated film as a shock movie." It's a long and boring story about a defeat of fraternity, a bang so transparent that even Flounder at Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, a tax-paying actor, can be forgiven for taking any work he could get. The same can not be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously acted for such cinematic strikes as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape, but fortunately not DVD. Unintentional garbage that belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
