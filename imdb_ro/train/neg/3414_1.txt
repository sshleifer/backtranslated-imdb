This is just terrible, garbage very horrible. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But while this can work in the mechanism of a porn movie? could it even be a hit like a porn movie? this is trying to masquerade as a "movie" with real things to say, with emotion and real fighting. Is not. It's an excuse to get some naked girls and have a fun time. I'm sure all these women (and men) in this movie could have done a decent job in porn movies in the 1970s. . but not in the real business of the film. The actor was hackneyed, so bad, I mean really terrible. The writing was even worse. Can not blame these actors? they had nothing to do with them. The very structure or graphics of the film could be accomplished and performed well with good writers and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting outsiders like a sniper. These shocks were motivated by men who did not quite respect their women. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less free sex images we could have something to work with. This movie should have been shot, made and sold a hardcore porn movie all the time; would have made more money. It's basically a hardcore porn video already, and it's the only non-porn movie I've ever seen that shows a male erect penis.
