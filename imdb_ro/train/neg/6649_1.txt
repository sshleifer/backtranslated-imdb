OK, anyone who could say honestly that this movie was great or even good is either delusional, or knows the director, the writer and the producers and is trying to increase the buzz of this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked for him and it was horrible. I'm an actress and I've worked in the industry for a while on the big and even independent films and this movie bored me with tears. The reason I'm so tough is that this movie was clearly different in terms of "Of Mice and Men" and should sue because it's such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classical book and the movie "Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new spin I mistaken so much. The actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateurs and the writings were painful. I mean if you want to make a new move on an existing story, make sure it's as good or better as the original to make new justice. I did not like this movie at all.
