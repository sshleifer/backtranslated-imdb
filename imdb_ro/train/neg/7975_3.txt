When I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with it!" Chances are, you too. It starts intriguing. A Los Angeles Colonel who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful, dignified brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom she met in a park just before. Then one day she disappears. Police can not find any documentation that has ever existed, and Firth is doing its own searches. So far, so good. Just as he will give up, he will return to his best friend, Billy Zane, and will meet in his previous life in the sordid underground of drugs, night clubs and LA footage, and then in the history of mental instability. At that moment, Firth's life is in danger, and the movie collapses. None of the characters in Lisa Zane's past is interesting. The film moves slowly and the action is very small. There is a subplot about the lack of drug money, but it's just a throw away. They are not watched, there are cliffhanging sequences and there is no suspense. Just a few boring beats and a lot of talk with boring characters. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in a scene together. By the end of the movie, you are broken between the question of what might have been and the attempt to stay awake.
