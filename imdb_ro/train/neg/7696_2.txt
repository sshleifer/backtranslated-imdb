Yes, stupid! I just finish watching and still taste badly in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "addons" to a story, too many stupid characters (I guess they wanted to get a fun comic, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. The shame of ruining a divine story of "Arab nights" like that. Copilous, na√Øve (both in a bad way) and many mistakes of magic breaking, I do not think he could keep a child for five more than ten minutes. The princess is wonderful, but it should be language-free, because the actresses do not know how to play a role. The rest of the distribution is even worse ... "our bad guy" is very bad. Shame that the good guy is not better. Only the light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who, unfortunately, goes well below his level, but at least he retains his actor / fighter skills at the top. I'm sorry I saw him in a thing like this, but glad I had something to see in all the bullshit, so I thank you for David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give these two stars this fiasco ... I would give him more for him, but that would raise the final score to the whole movie. The rest is so bad that I probably would like to classify him, but there is not a grade amateur, then 1, and I think it would be too much.
