Let me start by saying that I am a great fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many long-standing arguments attempt to support the film's claim that dragons have ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but does not investigate them more closely, which could have given the credibility of the film. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a fantastic story narrated about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with the popular TV-show-CSI style before-before to make it look like something scientific, which is certainly not. In many cases, the arguments / indices are removed. In some cases, the evidence used to show the dragons existed, flew or spit fires are simply invalid. To see that, it makes me crack in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs a certain degree of reality, but it does not have it. Bottom Line: This is a pretentious documentary of CIS fantasy that is not worth watching.
