This is a remarkable, remarkable remake of Bimal's classic parallelepiped. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and is a distortion of the original. Well, you can appreciate some degree of creativity, but not misleading creativity. Everyone's action is affected and the whole movie is a fake. Choosing Shekar's father for Lolita's abuse (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scenario where Shekhar (Saif) hits Lolita is quite unclear with the flow of the film and the characters, is quite offensive to the senses and could easily be avoided. Similarly, the sex scenario between Saif and Balan is quite inappropriate for the film and a cheap trick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work breaks down. The song "piyu bole" is pretty good. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif stands up for himself and revolts against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On this issue, this film deserves 3 stars. Rekha's song and dance give birth to artifacts and is a kid. The song is tuneful, but I remember that I heard it somewhere before and if I did not mistaken the song seems to have been plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Well, he agreed that the times have changed since then. But this film does not even reflect the modern era. This happens when Bollywood's modern film makers are becoming increasingly obsessed with impressing NRIs and exploiting the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not reach either India or anywhere in the world.
