:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Dude, this movie was terrible. A Catholic thriller / superstitious / suspense moves over the already well-prepared ground from previous films. The doubtful priest. Sex and Priesthood. Politics and religion. The hypocrisy church. The conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of a new bad age. All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil. Pretty bad and limp, with a poor story. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of Uninducing the Sick - the last rights a person can ask to cleanse their sins while on the brink of death; And the excommunication, the act of cutting a person from the Church. Basically, an excommunicated person can not receive the Absolution. That's how it comes to the Painter and I leave it to it. Throw into all the things I have already listed and done the "Order." I found the scene of sex with the priest interspersed with photos of a Virgin Mary, rather insulting to the Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying, "I am the Redeemer and the curse of sins, I live without love bla bla bla" / cue he walks in the dark alley with the long treasure coat of "The Matrix"> <br /> I gave this film 1 because it was not only strange and non-original, but also because it succeeded in insulting a whole faith in this process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
