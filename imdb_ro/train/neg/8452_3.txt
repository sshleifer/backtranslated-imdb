This is the first time I commented on a movie because I felt that if the right person read it, she might wake up and do something about it. In recent months, the ABC family has begun to broadcast a new movie format. I saw the last three and I enjoyed them. They were hired and made a trick. My wife likes these movies. I look forward to watching "See Jane Date". Trailers have looked great. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book must be a few years before the effort of the writers and musicians involved in this project. Year is 2003, source (all bad), the score was as interesting as a lift walk in a store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. She's been working against her. I work in the field of cinema and television. I like to be distracted. This is a situation where I thought it might get worse. The script has had lines from another decade and I know these women can act, but you would not have known of this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end left me to shake my head. An advice for Disney, ABC, ABC Family and Producers: In any case, please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to make any of your future movies. They have lost touch and need to understand what the word "contemporary", "present" and "current" means when describing a romantic comedy. There is a world that goes through you. All in all, a great disappointment from people to von Zerneck-Sertner and the ABC family.
