While it was a great Western James Arnes, this film has descended as the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, inaccurate through it, and only misleading mistakes to boot! Continuity has been distributed to the four winds. Does anyone catch the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to burn cannons that obviously had mud and ram, still stuck to the tubes. Come on! Then it's Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! The costumer must have been gone or not. Or just out of their minds!
