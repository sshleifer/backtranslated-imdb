My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite congruent with mine. What makes me is that, in terms of film, it is stupid and devoid of any appearance of a story, reason or dialogue. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that replacing songs with songs that fail to inspire someone outside a diminishing audience is not the same as creating characters that are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A bad narrative remains as such despite the iconic heritage of Neal Young. The most childlike scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slides a tonic to a hero who is no longer showing up, who then finds his way on the dance floor to guide Young's words for the heroine song he does not know what is happening. Somehow, these two dreams a scheme where they will go up to the West Coast looking for ????? Sorry Neal, stay with the music and leave Steven Stills's movie.
