I hated this movie so much that I remember very much. It's not really funny. Any film based on unfortunate sexual jokes and the humor of racism is not worth the money it costs to do it. In the first half an hour, Rob Schneider was drinking a box of rancid milk. All I could think was "he deserves, because he made such a bad movie." Do not waste your time or money on this.
