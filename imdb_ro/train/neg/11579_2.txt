I have to admit I do not remember too much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there was one, I was so irritated by this movie that I had a little hard to focus on. How can you name a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then shoot it in Texas? The desert country around Arlington (I think it was the location) does not resemble the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much more enjoyable neighborhood. Obviously, nobody in the movie was Tulsa anymore, or else he would have understood how nothing in the movie is so resembling him. Has not anyone seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders at all? I know it sounds pretentious, but I can not help her. I have seen this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two interesting actors could not live this story of pride, and a false story about the people involved in themselves who are NOT in trouble! I'm sorry, it can not be more expensive to shoot in Oklahoma. What if "living and dying in LA" was shot in Toronto? Would suck? Well, that too.
