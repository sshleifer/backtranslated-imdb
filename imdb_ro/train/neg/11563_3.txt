This Italian semi-horror film begins very much like a soft porn base film and turns into a mystery that has few to many free heads to be good, and that it's pretty boring just making this movie pretty not perfect for my tastes. The only thing you deserve to watch is a lot of tits that are spreading in the movie. The story has a guy who, at the beginning of the film, lures the girls in his castle, where he takes them to their dungeon, berserk and kills them. They show nudity, but they never show the crime at this time of the movie. Then the guy finds a beautiful red head at a party and goes out to do it and marry her. He has something for the red heads that you see as his ex-girlfriend, ex-wife Evelyn, also died in conditions that were not normally the vision of the audience. After many crime scenes, crimes began, involving snakes, foxes, and others. At this point, it's easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the crime and why is it a nonsensical ending in which everything is not packing so well. This movie did not work for me, left me many questions, and the last third of the movie did not have the brasses of the first two-thirds of the movie. Explanation of Evelyn's death would have helped the film as if it had had an end in which Evelyn got up from the grave. Granting the title is not completely misleading as it has left the grave, not just under its own power. Gore is very easy for the most part, because there is a scene with foxes and a scene at the end with a bit of blood too. I thought for the most part this movie was a tedious tad.
