The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his clients' relatives. At the same time, he decides to model his killing after the Zodiac killer of the 1960s. He comes in contact with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and forms a friendship. Michael has a weapon (apparently the only gun, as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors, but not portrayed as the same gun) and he left the prison. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but editing and acting even drowned the plot. I thought the "blood" was too fake, the light was horrible in some places, and the dialogue was too standard. The movie was filmed on video, which is fine, but the editing of the film was only for strange scenes "Plan 9". It's not a bad movie for B-film fans, but if you want something with a bit more Polish, go to something else.
