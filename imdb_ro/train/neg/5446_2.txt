For loyal fans Duran Duran who want to watch a good musical video, skip him. The producers decided to become creative and make the video of the 80s a story of SF, which involves the evil villain of Barbarella, from which the band took its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea go wrong is that even in the midst of Duran Duran's songs in the 1980s, confusing and annoying scenes are showing that the fictional antagonist is trying to stop the band at one of their concerts . Not only is good music interrupted repeatedly, but we have to suffer through a cheap spin-off story hosted by a bad doctor, Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
