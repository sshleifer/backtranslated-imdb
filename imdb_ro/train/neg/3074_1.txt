Even for cocaine linked to the 1980s, this is a pathetic one. I do not understand why someone would want to lose celluloid, time, effort, money and auditory brain cells to do this. If you want to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to shoot garbage like this, keep it for you. If you release it as a joke like this: NO! I mean, it was a joke, right? Somebody tell me it's a joke. Please.
