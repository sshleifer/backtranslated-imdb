I was very excited about this movie after reading this book. My son, 13, looks forward to him too. I rented it and I grasped it to enjoy a classic celebration story on the screen. Well, I was disappointed. This movie has come out of the book several times than it is forgiving. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this case, it seemed he was fully in character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time was pretty flat. I realize that this was done in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it was about the quality of the B movie, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley. The greatest disappointment was the fact that they left one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit The Christmas Contest takes Scrooge into the whirlpool tour of the world, observing people in the most grim circumstances that still have the light and the love of Christmas . I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with "reformat" Scrooge at the end. This was a refreshing portrait. I wish Bob Cratchit to have been portrayed a bit tattered and below. And Tiny Tim ... oh, I'm not even arranging bad actors ...
