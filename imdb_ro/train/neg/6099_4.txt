This was a less interesting short film I've seen between Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film came out of its very intense Technicolor technology, the film itself did not move, and sometimes the plot seemed rather cheesy - as it was done for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience NO NOT a consideration . In particular, I've even looked at how many times things have been resumed in the movie - as when the characters talked to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "lady," "Miss Barton," or " Clara ". In addition, a confused soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a confederate rebel, ..." - almost like he was Mojo Jojo's cartoon character from Powerpuff Girls. It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later "Perry White" on the television show SUPERMAN) with a beard in the role of President Garfield. Yes - he's under this beard.
