One thing that amazed me with this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being the major historian on the Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, much of the actual events have been altered or ignored. Another commentator said von Trotta said he never wanted Lena to go with Goebbels, but in this case, why did he give the whole impression that this was happening? Why would not it show other possible reasons for the liberation of men, such as the disaster that was Stalingrad or the fear of the Nazis that the international press, based in Berlin, would find out about the protest. , why did the whole story play the second mirror on a family-friendly story that was made again and again? Definitely something wonderful that this may have its own history! Instead, it was like the movie had two lines of story that really seemed to have little in common. Generally, this film did not succeed in its purpose, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a shame, because it did better, it could have had a major impact.
