A stupid and simply strange movie about a child who gets traumatized when he learns that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or cute. One Christmas fixes himself and decides to kill naughty people - dressed as Santa of course. Puzzling and simply evil killer movie Santa. If you're looking for a gore, it's not here. Only a few of the crimes are shown and are not those that have a very false effect. Most of the film contains only Brandon Maggart talking to himself and slowly becoming mad. The script is tricked, the acting is terrible and leads to an end that made me watch TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I did not have a hallucinatory one! Indeed, indeed, the poor end. If you want a scary chirp for Christmas, the rent "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70s - NOT the terrible remake). Avoid this at any cost.
