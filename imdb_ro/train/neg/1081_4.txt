There's only one nice character in this movie. Is Kenneth Branagh's lawyer we should shoot him? Let's see - we learn that he is a defense attorney who becomes criminals in techniques. He treats his colleagues as bovines, involves them in a personal crisis (underway, they lead to the killing of one of them), jeopardizes the safety of his children, threatens his new husband's new boyfriend, tries to arm the police and the administrators school - and all this for what? Because he was thinking with LITTLE's head! I even drew my father and his gang to beat the lawyer's filler and drown him in the swamp ... he would have done for a much more satisfactory end.
