=== Minor Spoilers === <br /> <br /> They are, like many others, a huge fan Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging in front and the trailer coming before MI: 2, the expectations grew. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Large vehicles. Nothing Cage and Fresh from an Oscar - Angelina Jolie. What can go wrong? A lot. <br /> <br /> The script is not funny (it's hard to try), nor is it interesting. Put a black person who constantly makes racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa! Do you have a comedy? I do not think. Excitement is totally out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said many times) there is no sympathetic character to care who is killed? If you can stomach the premise that a psychopath will kill Nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know is that Kip (the brother) walks again with Nic on the streets . Is this emotion? You do not think so. Then comes the best bit - the romance between Nic and Angelina. In fact, she seems bored to have to say all these stupid lines to Nothing. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' "Do you see someone?" 'What went wrong?' etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one glow of hope left: the machine follows. I am very disappointed to say, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them and there is only one. A very long period, caught in an irritating motion of the camera. I really had problems with the action. So is it a action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there is no need to decide, avoid this awful mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars and feel like I'm generous.
