Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a little amusing in this 1970s, but the script is so cruel and insulting that Goldie Hawn's youth (just after the Oscar victory) can not start to get him out of the mud . As a celebrity skirt-chasing in the 40's, sellers are offended more in grade n. <br /> <br /> A 3 of 10. Best Performance =? Nicky Henson plays a young guy. I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well, because I do not see any other reason for this type of murder in 1970 (a very good year for movies - CATCH-22, MASH, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, 5 EASY PIECES and many others). You can not win all of them!
