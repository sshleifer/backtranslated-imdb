Do not be confused with the supernatural thriller above, The Sentinel. Sentinel was a great film for me, without offering consistent action, some critics promised on the back. For me it seemed to me that everyone left her half, and only there to make some quick money, because she felt like a television movie. Sentinel is a remix of several better movies, such as "In The Line Of Fire," it has no originality in it, and watching Michael Douglas run around, feeling stupid in my opinion. The main issue, along with its inexperience, had to be the poor rhythm. I often enjoyed myself as I was trying to watch this movie, while watching how long it is, more than once. Not only miscasting with Eva Longoria, who could not convince her worth a lick. Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a trustworthy actor here, obviously going through the movements. He does not convince a man on the run, or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also stopped. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here's just OK, nothing more than that. He tries to happen like a gruff, but he managed to be bland, then anything else, and, to be honest, did not seem interested. Eva Longoria Parker is quite mediocre. She did not convince her in her role, and she was a pure candy for her eyes. Kim Basinger is pretty terrible like the first lady. She seems bored with tears, and her role is a throw, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has an important role in the end, but it is not enough for me. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Sentinel is another political thriller that bored me with tears. He is too old, too tired and, most importantly, the lack of effort sucks. It is not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
