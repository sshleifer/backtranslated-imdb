By entering this movie you know this is the film has six lab technicians in a lab sealed with an invisible maniac. So, immediately guess who will live and who will die. Survivors are just what you would expect, so there are no points for plotting over there. And if you're not sure whether this is a B movie or a movie that just happens to be in a lab with an interesting story, William Devane plays a role: the instant state of B films. The film is promising at first. In the laboratory we are introduced to invisible gorillas that are becoming more and more violent. Ooooh, concerns. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same thing that makes Bacon invisible. There's a pair of naked breasts, a really dirty and pretty curtsy dirty joke, to give this movie an R rating that it really does not need. For a thriller there were really no surprises, unless Shue does that MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a "Whaaaa?" OK, there is a surprise. Then Caine (Bacon) returns once in the elevator shaft last time. It was a surprise, but just because you shout on TV, "Noooo! You're already dead! Finish the movie!" Speaking of shouting on television, that's all I've done in the last 25 minutes. "Put on your safety glasses!" Instead of putting their glasses in the infrared so they can see it, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). The story really lost it at the end. But the special effects were good; this is the only reason I give him 2/10.
