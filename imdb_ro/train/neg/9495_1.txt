This is a terrible movie, and not a scene has an ounce of sincere emotion. The characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable, and the story line is obvious and fulfilling the typical Hollywood desires. William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when this movie was made, but he plays someone at the age of 40 and looks like he is 60 years old. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was screened to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the road was sexy and had more life than their erotic connection. The character of Holden - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film (not coincidentally) - is featured with the obvious, pre-hippie traps of the 60's: the Bachelor's pad, the rocking hi-fi, the lunch Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously inappropriate, weird of the old phoney, desperately desiring that the free spirits they have seen at Sunset and Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin cars sexy. has never been so desperate, and I find myself thinking that Bill Holden was so desperate for the youth that he took this embarrassing part.
