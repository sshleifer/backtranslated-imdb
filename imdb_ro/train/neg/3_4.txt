If I had not read Pat Barker's "Union Street" before seeing this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It's actually my film, it's done well, and I do not mean otherwise, but as an adaptation, it fails from all angles. who lived in an area in northern England of working class, caught my heart and refused to go a few weeks after I finished. I was caught tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and misery when I read about women at Union Street. Excellent. A novel I sometimes felt I could not read, but the novel just could not get him down. Depression does, but very tight. The movie. Ouch. Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker and threw a layer of sweet sugar over his head. A beautiful movie, an inspired soundtrack, great performance, a story of hope and love ... yes. An adaptation of "Union Street" ... no. The women in Union Street and their stories are condensed in Fonda's character, their stories are touched, but many are thrown away. I accept that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and are too horrible for mass viewing and that a movie with about 7 leading actors is not practical, but content is not my main subject. The essence and intellectual truth of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the stench of poverty described graphically is replaced by sunlight, beautiful houses, and a glimmer of William's score. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope of "reality," I advise you to hesitate to read the book without first preparing for something more like "Schindler's List." .. but without the end happy.
