Shirley Jackson's novel "Haunting of Hill House" is an atmospheric story about terror that transmits supernatural phenomena into an old mansion. The atmosphere is well established and the colds are well organized. A haunting masterpiece. The 1963 cooler "The Haunting" remains closely related to the book, but he also adds his own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, so the book's terror and theft are even better on the screen. The black and white photo adds only to the fury of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then, Jan de Bont did that. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this remake. Why he had to make a remake of the 1963 film is a mystery in itself, but for now, let him watch the movie himself. It starts on average, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious and, for a few minutes, it looks like the movie will actually be quite redefining. Then the first hope appears: a harpsichord thread weakened a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and the truth is said, almost we had in tears. Since then, the film has been spiraling downwards. The actress seems to be somewhat woody, as the film goes on, Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it is such a relief when decapitated by the river). The special effects make this film in practice, which is a shame, because most are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of such things are many, so I will not bother to list them. Therefore, along with hundreds of others, we strongly recommend watching the original cooler or, alternatively, buy Shirley Jackson's novel. But please, stay away from this. And if you decide to watch this, watch it on TV (because many channels prefer to shoot this movie instead of the original) or rent it cheap, but please do not buy it, no matter what you do. Do not lose money! <br /> <br /> Final evaluation: 4/10
