The cars in this movie are great. The actor in this movie is terrible. Stage and driving scenes do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you really bother with movies where someone moves and suddenly goes faster, save your problems and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well there is a part in which they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally driver. If you can not tell the difference, go and see, you'll have an explosion. It's really down to this, there really are really really nice cars in this movie, they are horrifically driven and are completely unrealistic. The actress is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such beautiful cars would be represented in such a bad movie. If the car class was to match that of the movie, it would have to compete with rusty bicycles.
