This "movie" is a transvestite. No, wait for it - an abomination. NO, WAIT - is undoubtedly the absolute movie ever made with beloved characters created and set by other actors. I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even the daring to "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is asinin and gouging money. Laurel and Mr. Hardy respectively died from 1957 and 1965. Why would anyone begin to imagine that the appropriate updates for L & H would be in the person of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain are beyond me. I entered fully expecting to be terrified and embarrassed and certainly not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, shameful should be neglected from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and filming. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS - HAVE A WARNING ATTENTION.
