Despite the sterling works of supporter actors and a clever screenplay by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as "a crying tournament," and unfortunately this sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and top publisher / buddy will spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and completely annoying. The party has asked for an actor who can make you love him even when he is a brother - for example, Ewan McGregor. All the spiritual satire of the class system etc was wasted, thanks to this irritating and inappropriate performance. All I wanted to do was to shake him and tell him to go over himself.
