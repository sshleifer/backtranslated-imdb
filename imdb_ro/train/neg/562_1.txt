I like music, but as a fan of Dickens, I hate him. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in labor? The poor of London are going to sing? Do Fagin and Dodger go west? He is not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly and Fagin became mad in prison. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing a little more than mourning to show him the evil. However, the worst is Mark Lester as Oliver, who is often so weird and passive if you are the main character. His image is in no way helped by the fact that the best things he could do when singing is the oak in a girl's voice. I think they did not realize that triple boys can be found in almost all churches in England. Authors respecting Dickens' fans: Stay at David Lean's amazing 1948 film or BBC adaptation of the mid-1980s BBC. Avoid this slippery bully of a musical.
