Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his abilities, I noticed that this film is listed and was surprised to hear of him. I traveled more than usual during both the 2000 movie and when she hit the theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later (that the passing of time is the first indication that everything was not good with production) . Now Patrick Swayze can not act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough capacity to cope with the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person you would be pleased to see, even if he showed them he was staring at dry paint. Being curious, I checked the production information of this site. She made a weekend of $ 600 on the screen and a little over $ 400 each, after the theater of the month ran in the last year in 2002. The gross total was 261 pounds, which I doubt it could cover hotel and food location. <br /> <br /> The story is quite benign and even the use of Reno, usually interesting, is as boring as the rest of the games. It's something like a number of SNL bits have been built together, neither individually too large and even worse overall presentation. Whatever it was supposed to be, the costs for this production had to be considerable - even though they all worked less than the usual fees - so the only thing that made it a barely tolerable opposite was the quality of Billy Bob's filming and presence (although of course somewhat laconic here as compared to his usual work.) Think of the three wonderful, completely different characters he portrayed in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa" and you know he realized he was working under the standard, long before the audience had the opportunity to confirm it. A star for him right here, and one because production was better than, for example, the typical "Lifetime" movie.
