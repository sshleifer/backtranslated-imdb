Hunters follow what they think is a man through the woods, although the public sees it as a werewolf. Hunters do not seem to realize this, because after they shot him, he looks normal when he beats him. A doctor transmits the eyes of the werewolf to a man who has lost his own experience in the lab. The man, Rich, has sex with the nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before removing his bandages. After leaving the hospital, he finds out that his wife has also cheated on him. When a smoke machine sends clouds over an amateur board of a moon (with a branch of false trees in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His torso grows even bigger, splitting his shirt, and on his head he has a huge werewolf mask that has red lights in his eyes. His trousers remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, though a kind of robotic (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows gives it a bloody appearance from time to time. Despite the werewolf's werewolf suit, there is a fair amount of blood and gore, and these are pretty well made. There's even a pretty good head off in the movie. However, when a man falls from a height, a dummy pretty bad does the job. The rich has a friend called Siodmak, who is an occult expert, and he also happens accidentally over a small man with crutches called Androse, who is also such an expert. They try to help him a little. The rich kills people who have done it wrong. A policeman investigates the murders and tries to hit Beaton, who does not really care about lesbian scenes, so nothing comes of it. Quite cheap, but between nudity and blood and gore, and not a terrible story that combines (the other) the most dangerous game with the hands of Orlac and the wolf man, is somewhat fun. Available alone or in the Scream Queens Vol. 1 speaker set.
