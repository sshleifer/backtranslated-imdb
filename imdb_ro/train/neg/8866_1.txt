In theory, the "Director's Comment" should have worked. Rob Bryden, talented, plays Peter DeLane, the former television director, telling his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he is supposed to have worked are Bonanza, Flambards, Duke Duke Street and The Bounder. His comments are not very informative because of his custom of wandering from the point of view. But in practice it did not fail. It's a joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. The Scriptures are completely devoid of intelligence, and Bryden fails to convince an old man. Whenever he gets stuck for something funny to say, which is the same as every five seconds, he emits a lame laughter. Rather than be amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If the old men hurt you like hilarious, then that's for you. It did not help the shows to be mocked, except for "Lord and lady" and "Crossroads", good enough. For the jokes to work, they had to be very terrible, such as Charlie's Angels, OTT, Young Addicts, Neighbors, and New Faces. time, fortunately we are spared the horror of future editions. Would it not be ironic if the "Director's comments" had been a misleading day?
