The film was terrible. The theater died silently, because everyone was embarrassed to be there, watching such garbage. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him play a script with a five-year dialogue. Martial arts are "ok", but when it's placed next to Jackie Chan and "The Matrix," it's best to see one of them.
