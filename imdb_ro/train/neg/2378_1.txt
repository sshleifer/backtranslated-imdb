Why would any legitimate actor have read the script in this piece of nonsense? My God is actually embarrassing to even look at him. I can not imagine the shame that these people need to feel to be a part of it. Also, there seems to be some controversy over the fact that River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who asked before. This movie is proof that no matter how many "big names" you have. His ears do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someday someone can explain the reason for this movie. It has no strange, fun or even comical properties compared to anything else bad.
