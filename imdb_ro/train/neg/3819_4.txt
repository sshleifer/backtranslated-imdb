T.Z. Post, a college professor, receives a fake letter stating that he has inherited $ 750,000. Now with financial means, he withdraws his $ 4,000 life savings and decides to get out alive and live. After sending his luggage to a train in Chicago, he meets a voivode who travels and decides well enough to make a show on Broadway. The night of the show, the fresh postal teacher has to hide from his creditors, solve the problems between girlfriend Pansy and diva Eleanor and make sure that the show has to continue. After watching many of Keaton's unrecognized stones, this is a pain to stay, but I felt it could have been much worse. Supporting the role of Durante, Todd and Selwyn, it is sometimes disturbing, but still enjoyable. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as the director of the frustrated show. 90% of the script is badly written, while MGM is trying to quit this movie as a Marx Bros. movie, where many of the gangs have fallen from scratch. Compiled with Keaton's drinking problems at the time, this film is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating- 3.
