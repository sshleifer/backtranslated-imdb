So ... that's how Brando's images were added ... interesting things, but not really Oscar. Susannah York was just a boy. A new scene where Lois finds out that Clark is Superman is unbelievable by not noticing that instead of real bullets there are guns in the gun. The real bullets would have penetrated into his clothes and then flew off the floor, but we forget ... to listen to Donner to have fun with Lester's version, which made more sense. The president speaks of Zod who "defames" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Adjusting that scene made that line quite absurd. Superman's "Freedom of Press" line sounded bad compared to "Getting Out" which was delivered better and had a perfect connection with Clark's previous scene in stopping the truck. Then it ends with the "turn the world back in time" effect. It turned everything into the whole movie and made you wonder exactly where the rocket was held for Hackensack, N.J., because it does not release Zod and the company anymore.
