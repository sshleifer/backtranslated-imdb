The only reason this movie is rated 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a thinner plot than depressing cabbage soup, horrible action and special effects showing that they have emerged from the television series "Thunderbirds," it's amazing that Widmark did not kill the director because he put that black sign in his resume . Even until the 1950s, the special effects are atrocious, with the exception of a few underwater submarine sequences. I can only assume that he has been nominated for the best special effects because, except for 20,000 leagues under the sea and THEM!, There was no one else. Surely there was no contest for Disney that year if it were their only competition. I would not recommend the film, not even for submarine movies, because the most realistic scene of the submarine was limited to a single blow that can see that seawater can be perceived in the periscope. There are other, much better movies that you can enjoy this era, such as the 20,000 leagues mentioned above or the Torpedo Run.
