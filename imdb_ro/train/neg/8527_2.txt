There are three movies with this animation style that I remember sincerely. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I have my own copies of "The Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and have not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I had not. The most disturbing thing was the script. It was incredibly agitated and often inert. Things would happen for no reason, and other things would happen without explanation. We are not just talking about small things; we talk about key plot points! The story itself is not that big to start, but it could have worked if the script was decent. Not even close. Besides, the music was awful! I know that music in movies like these rarely have what they would call classic songs, but the music in this movie made me want to knock unconsciously with a bowling ball. This was one of those movies I was supposed to show my children one day, but it was just cut. I do not think I could stay out of this crap again. Disappointed makes it easy.
