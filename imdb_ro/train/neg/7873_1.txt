This movie is so bad and worsens in all imaginable ways. It's not just the bad act and the scenario, it's not the lame and perverse weather that loses her in watching her. What really puts this movie in my shamehouse is the apparent struggle that writers and producers make with the movie to try to make it funny. The actress who replaces Jean Reno's descendant is elderly and learned the lesson in the first film to add a new girl to marry. Almost all original excerpts and gags are coming back, this time makes me want to bite my eyes from the sockets because it's a waste of perfect film. Torturing constantly cuts and still pictures of the camera in any scene in this movie can put the spectator in violent convulsions. This second film takes the original and pulls it out of its coffin and parades the body in the public square and destabilizes not only the original idea and her inheritance but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce goose, could not fly because it had no plot in the main ones who were returning for a "necklace". No scenario, as it was apparently written and added daily. No attention is paid to the camera or images. Light illumination and special effects made for the sake of doing so. This movie will not even pass for a student movie in the base movie 101. How did this pile come through no one can say. It was a great investment in loss and it seems that no one has the power to take this unnatural mistake out of our misery. This movie has a good part ... its END! This movie is the best film of all time, eventually "Howard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
