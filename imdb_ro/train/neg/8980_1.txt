I will never forget the night I saw the movie. I was on a patrol submarine in the North Atlantic and this was the scheduled evening movie. We all gave up after the second drum. They did not even try to show them in the middle of the night. By calling for a repeat instead ...... That's all I have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I should not comment with random words, so I will continue to wander until I bring my ten BS lines. I did not find George Goble enrolled in credits, but I remember him in the movie. Sining was terrible, and the songs were even worse.
