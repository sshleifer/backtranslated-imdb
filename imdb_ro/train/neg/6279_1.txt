No, basically, watch something that makes no sense. In order not to spoil the movie for those who really want to take a look at the movie, I'll explain the story. A regular everyday woman goes to a street, her own car. She is following her, and many events take place at that time that includes her and her family. I made a special account to comment on this movie, about how horrible it was. The actor was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - could have been added extraordinarily and could become a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer tried to do by doing this at the end of the movies, most questions get answers, but this movie asks: What happened and 1 hour 20 minutes went for nothing. /> <br/> Spoiler Starts__ <br /> <br /> We had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come to our world and kill us. It was not all done during the movie and you never know how it happens or why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally shows up and runs away (the lover of the sisters) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds after. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, I threw it immediately after .. do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing is done again.
