Everything about this movie was terrible. To start with this movie it had a fairly good distribution and it seems impossible to make such a big casting in the biggest disaster to the genre of gangster ever. The soundtrack was like a very poor comedy. He had this music throughout the movie and started to become quite irritating. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLUENCE THIS DISABILITY PLEASE PLEASE ONLY
