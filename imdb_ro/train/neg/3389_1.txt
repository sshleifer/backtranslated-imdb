I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy of this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to reconsider Chorus for the screen, but could not figure out how to do it. If the man who came with the show is hit - it should answer your question. There are a few shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough's fresh musical work "Ghandi" and animal dances in "Doctor Doolittle" came to lead this film, which had no resemblance to the stage show. Surprising! Surprising songs! Great songs have been abandoned or given to other characters (that did not make sense). Michael Douglas was sent on mission. People who could not dance were trying to act and there was the sexy "Landers" woman who could not sing, act or dance - I think he had just finished Ghandi's wife. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances show nothing but "schidlock" in Flashdance, and nothing works. I sat amazed how something so riveting and emotional to be drained to nothing. If you really like this show and returns to Broadway in 2006 - see it, but think long musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this film.
