"Smithereens" is a kind of worthless blow that is just among the television channels that deal with space as a sweet novel in the public library. A small amount of collapse and a first effort for mediocre director Seidelman, the film is full of bad action, bad sound, improper room work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better movies never manage to sell and why junk shots like this and do not seem to disappear is one of the great mysteries of life. (D)
