This splendid British / Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see from it. I have three versions, two VHS, a DVD and all are very carved, so bad that it looks like the buildings are talking to each other. Several films suffer as bad from pan and scan as this, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so in love with the widescreen process he used to use both sides of the screen simultaneously, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see all the inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are steep cuts of peasants pulling their rifles, a Mexican shot is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate and that's it. We never know why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never know what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), though I suspect he was called home to stay in Kojak because his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange retrospect sequence in which Michael Craig ("Mysterious Island") dances around a bowler hat and a bad costume in the old tradition of the English music room at the Battle of 1960, BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here, the lyrics I have not heard before. On the plus side, the location is wonderful, an ancient ruinous fortress with Escher-style stairs that leads nowhere, a beautiful diving by Robert Shaw and good performances of Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I did not like this movie, but I did not see it. I will try the widescreen version and then make my decision.
