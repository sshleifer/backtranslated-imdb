A boring movie about a boring city in the 1950s. How can anyone think it's a classic? The producer ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several films that have moved far beyond her acting ability. I think this film gives a glimpse into how wicked Peter Bogdonovitch's future movies will be. Cybil Shepard's career sank after being in several movies Peter Bogdonovich produced. Only after "Moonlighting" his career began to recover. I thought acting was a poor interpretation of the "graduate". I noticed that this movie was not presented in the US. The only place I was looking at was that it was across the ocean in late-night Europe.
