I do not think it's so bad for a show under the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbids anyone to go to law school on the basis of these programs, which I heard when I watched some interviews of the show. That made me cough a little. Besides, Spader and Shatner, who should be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. Although this may be a compliment in certain situations, it certainly is not here. Their constant harassment on the show is fun at first. But since that's what they literally do all the time, I realize it's as profound as the show will appear. The attempt to scatter serious, dramatic moments and even tears in the midst of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest that I have experienced in trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's flashy and free advertising ads, in which he changes his opinions, does not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for Crane's speech wearing a colonial costume. I give two stars because there are times when I thought the attempts of the show to deal with contemporary issues were done with care. I think the show's writers have become aware of the fact that Denny and Alan's sexual harassment has become arrogant even to those who have invited them from the beginning. The thing is, I do not care if the treatment of sexual harassment in the show is well done but I feel the writer insulted me by artificially implanting sex banters along the show in the hope that my libido will make me come back for more. I'm no longer a teenager, and I think this show is promising if its purpose would not be to answer the smallest common denominator to get ratings. Of course, I write this after realizing that it really will not be much better than that. It's a shame because it's one of the shows I'd love to love.
