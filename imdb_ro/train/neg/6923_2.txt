Absolutely awful Mexican film is probably based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a daily newspaper that wants to go within a sheltered shelter in the woods to write a story about how it works, When our hero, Gaston, is considering the great show of Dr. Maillard, the head of the asylum, we see all sorts of things that should be terrible, like men who hang on for a long time in a dungeon and comedy like that being our hero being joked by soldiers as he climbs up a staircase hanging from a part of a building. Then there is a view that should have been one: a man filled like a chicken, yes, it is even a chicken that fries around the earth for chicken food. The scene was supposed to be a movie comedy, but at least for me it was the lowest point of the film and really the most revolting when you thought the men and women raised thought this could be fun from a distance. Ah! This is really the real horror, which is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this important fact about the movie in which most of the films that suffer multiple edits of titles usually have a serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems, and others, of which one is one, have numerous changes to the title, so that someone can innocently buy the same garbage several times. This is definitely garbage. It has very few possibilities. The only interpreter to look at is Claudio Brook as head of the asylum. He is a huge bumblebee, as maniacally laughs, orders bellows with a sword in his hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired to hear them talking about the "soothing system" as a means of healing mental illnesses. What kind of ludicrosity (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this one deserves this type of word). It will not take too long to figure out what's going on in the asylum and it will not be interesting anymore. Kinematic chicken scratches!
