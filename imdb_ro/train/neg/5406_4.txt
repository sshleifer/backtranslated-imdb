My first opinions on this movie were, of course, bad. I was expecting terrible action, bad, fun, ridiculous, special effects. What I received was not that bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the film quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent. The act was not that bad, and overall, I enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a bad movie, but it's not absolutely worthless, as I thought it would be and I'm delighted to know that this movie managed to amaze me, even when it was not that good. Generally, it's a film that should be avoided, but it was not as bad as I expected to be.
