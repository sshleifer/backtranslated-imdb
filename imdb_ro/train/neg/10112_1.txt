Every year, I watch hundreds of movies, including many simple amateur abomination from a low budget that no one would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of movies in my time, many excellent, many forgotten. Zombie Nation Will I ever remember as one of the most horror horror films I've ever seen? in fact, I have not yet recovered from my experience of pursuing it. The following day seems to be a kind of strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work from a warehouse? The voodoo prize really recommends that "zombies" eat cheese? It's sure? It's sure? It's sure? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend to the Zombie nation if you want to see a "good" movie and I would not recommend it as "so bad". However, if you are distracted by the prospect of probably watching the most indefinite film the abyss ever? This is for you. Now, whenever someone asks me what's the worst movie I've ever seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. Seriously? I think it's a bigger crime to make a boring movie than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that really amazes you with its ineptitude. He is really Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age and I can not wait to see if he makes another film as ridiculous as this movie.
