After watching this in the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this movie is borrowing. It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least others. At one point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any clue about how many holes there are in the plot. such as the fact that, although gas is not available, there is a lot of gas in the abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough to keep an F1 racing car running all over the country.
