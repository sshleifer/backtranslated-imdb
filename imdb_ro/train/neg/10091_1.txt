I can not believe this movie has ever been created. I think the director is trying to make an artistic piece in moments, but that only makes it worse. Zombie looks like they have applied too much eye makeup. Zombies are just in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, maybe five or six total zombies, certainly not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one, is certainly the credits, because the painful experience was finally over. Again, to reiterate other user comments, voodoo prizes are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl that does not make sense at all. It is never explained.
