When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a horror movie well done, but this was really quite different, representing what I would describe as an initial effort of science. Karloff and Lugosi play both scientists (Rukh and Benet) - competitors to a certain extent, until Rukh wins Benet with a demonstration that proves his great theory. Science was at least a little rough around the edges (so science fiction, with emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses a kind of radius from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "a few thousand million years ago." At that time, a giant meteor hit Africa, leaving the deposits of a substance called by Radium X scientists - who can heal and destroy. Much of the film is quite sad in Africa, looking for meteor deposits, which Rukh finally finds and uses them to create a large weapon, unfortunately inflicting a kind of illness that makes him and he's a big gun. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi takes on a role that the boy is pretty good about, although I discovered him in a very convincing way - especially during the scenes in Africa. And the story went up a little, and while he kept my attention, he did not captivate me. Since this is indeed a science fiction movie, rather than a horror movie, and sci-fi has been in its very early stages, I suppose the movie has to be cut a little weaker. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing less. 4/10
