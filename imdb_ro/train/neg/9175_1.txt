This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film fits the quality of such films as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever," but even those who had name actors if it dropped. The "Candy of the Eyes" of this film was a 50-year-old woman with a facial lifting. (just one example of quality). I would have evaluated this negative film, if possible. Ladies, I have to tell you that the men were not bad to look, but not too much. If you are going to watch this movie, I recommend saving your money.
