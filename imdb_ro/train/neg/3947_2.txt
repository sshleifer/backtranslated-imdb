In Comic, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorectic fashion model. Nor has the morality or personality that Modesty has in the comic strip. Modesty would never give a woman advice to show more skin to earn more money. I can not see similarities with my comic books with Modesty and this movie. As an impossible film, Ethan Hunt was imprisoned in the high school detention room, talking to the goalkeeper when he went to high school, and Hunt was played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). So, if you're a fan of the modest, you do not see the movie you're just going to upset. If you do not know too much about the modest comedy, renting another movie does not waste your time with this. I do not understand how Quentin Tarantino can name it. I'll ask for a refund to my DVD rental store tomorrow.
