In spite of having met people who are either fans extraordinary of Noam Chomsky, whether it is a relic tired of the 1960s, I was not really a judgment in men, except that I knew that gained fame as a linguist, though I could not elucidate anything his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist inclinations. So, after passing over DVD documentary Noam Chomsky 2003: Rebel without a pause, in a video store used a film that followed a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, I decided to I get him, he may have little knowledge of the next man when a person, pro or con, talked about him. While I was glad to have received the film, my initial reaction to this bored and bad hagiography was, so what's all this about? For a man with so many degrees praised as "the most important intellectual in life" by the New York Times, depending on the DVD case, surely there was not much there from an intellectual point of view. I know I'd chewed him and spit in a debate, and I would not even want to look at what William F. Buckley could do to him. Granted, the whole film seem that Chomsky sees conspiracies everywhere and having collages mesh coated in approving amazing things most unique and outrageous that they would say, rather than to linguistic, perhaps this is why the come so bad. But again, if he is a linguist and is in his top, why in the world someone would take care of what he has to say in any field outside his field of expertise? Even worse are his acolytes, who seem to further isolate man from reality by encouraging the illusion that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins. As little as I knew about Chomsky before watching this movie, I knew this very much: in general, he was thought to have been, and from an intellectual point of view, quite irrelevant since the fall of the Soviet Empire. The film is so poorly structured, and without a narrative thread, that it is difficult to separate everything. His wife, Carol, as an example, apparently gave an interview, which was cut and cast anywhere in the movie. She seems to be a fairly pretty woman, but entirely out of her element, responding to anything but the most elementary questions about their lives. The only interesting thing he says is that the 9/11 was a great thing for Chomskys, because he won a lot of money talking about the charges. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this type of film offers almost no biographical background. It is supposed that all viewers must know all the pleasures that this "great man" bears. Chomsky is rarely interviewed to one another. In terms of style, there is movement room, interesting changes and no signs of signature and most of the film is destroyed by Chomsky huzzahs Chomsky recorded on this or another, students looked at him as though he were immaterial, that is, when the dim-coats do not ask questions that are barely audible and ridiculous of simplistic. The film is very poorly done by director and publisher Will Pascoe, who, in the DVD filming statement, shows that it is still a Chomsky uncritical acolyte. Besides, one of the surest signs that there is an objective documentary, but only a piece of agitprop agitprop vanity, is that there is one time that Chomsky shown that struggles with an answer. It seems to be a font of knowledge that has no limits. Since much of the movie was filmed during conferences of Chomsky at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, much of what he says Chomsky seems equally distant like the Vietnam War. Yes, he does some good points, here and there, about the complicity of the American press before the war, but he pursues them with a little weakness, because he does not seem to realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not are full of plot. As an example, he argues that the advertising industry is a cabal that ruthlessly controls the population, but does not say a word about the zombie population that is left to be controlled. Similarly, he claims that the trilateral people rule the world, and that people's fear of murder is still a result of the war. Of course, this statement explains so far the crime crisis centers, and all the other lawyers' offices in time and money consumed consumes. He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when Castro and the company have been its great sponsors in Latin America, Asia and Africa, until the Soviet Union has fallen. I can only believe that UFO conspiracies expect only Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have created centers for the impregnation of species in Idaho. In his simple, gray world, Chomsky is frighteningly dense as the members of Bushco, which he is, are; all the more so since they do not claim to be intellectuals. In short, Chomsky is a man who lives in the past, over his head in most of his problems and in his intellectual depth. Close to this film, he warns, "Be careful when you hear that intellectuals are fighters for justice," but one can only laugh that man has never met a revolutionary person or the idea he does not love, no matter how barbarous the crime their, and anti-intelligence their position. Please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and irrelevant DVD.
