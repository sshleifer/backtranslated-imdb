It's almost not recommended this movie. Chase Masterson is always pleased to look and actually be able to act, although her role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the distribution varies from bad to mediocre. In many movies like this one, someone will shine through the material and note them for further references. There's no luck here. Creature Unknown ", a clich√© with moving monsters, with the kids beating each other. The monster is a man in a rubber suit that listens back to Paul Blaisdell's days, so bad, it's good! so bad it's bad A little bit of humor would have made it tastier, but everyone creates the deadly death material straight up There's a twist or two at the end, but until then you do not care.
