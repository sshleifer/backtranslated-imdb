"Private practice" is cut off by the anatomy of "Gray's Anatomy" quite successful and well written. Distribution is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is terrible. The pre-pilot disguised as an episode of Gray's Anatomy should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So we put the DVR on the pilot band and all the other episodes. As I looked at the pilot, I always looked at how a show with such a cast of loyal actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot should suck people and keep them back for longer. It should be emotion, flash, great writing, intriguing story with a cliffhanger that has to answer throughout the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this show did not have any of them. Thinking it was a fluke, I looked at the second episode in the hope of the best. And, although marginally better, it does not come close to what needs to be interesting, it can not miss TV. I took this show from my show list to watch. It is not worth the IMO effort, and I would be very surprised if this show even before the middle of the season. Get him one of them.
