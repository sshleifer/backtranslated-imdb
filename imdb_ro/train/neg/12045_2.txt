Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, even if I use it as a reference for quite a long time. Therefore, I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably affect my hope that I will not upset myself. <br /> <br /> I spent two years of my life (all that we made the Greeks), analyzing the epic Omirus (and not Homers as you see everywhere), rhyme through rhyme. If I remember well, it was the Iliad in the 8th grade and Odysseia in the 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a great disappointment for me and my Greek colleagues around the campus (I'm studying in the UK). The Iliad Epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus, 400 years after the current war. Historians put the Trojan War around 1200 BC, and the actual reason for the war is not Helen's beauty, but Troy's strategic position. That said, we can now understand that Omirus epic does not present actual events (because it is not exactly historical), but this has never been the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this gigantic poem can seek to ask for the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty, and so on. The best part and the most educative were these prolonged discussions between the warriors before the battle. None of these was disclosed in Troy Warner's Troy was really inexpensive for my eyes and other intellectuals, my Finnish and German colleagues myself. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, a perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work) and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> Shut up saying that it would be better to follow something else. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a very expensive movie B. <br /> <br /> Good luck
