RINGMASTER calls Jerry Springer the host of Jerry's television show, but it's not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are trash, but not trailer trash you get on JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they're attacking each other but not on ..... What is the purpose of making a movie about JERRY SPRINGER and claiming it is not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And, moreover, it's a very boring film
