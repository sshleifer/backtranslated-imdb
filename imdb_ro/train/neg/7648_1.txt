It is considered fashionable to highlight all social evil as a result of patriarchy and masculine domination, however moronal this illogical "logic" might be. However, in the film's story and theme, there is no gray area and the woman who should be called the film antagonist is "the villain of the story." Under no circumstances can it be justified what she did. Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It is a betrayal of the ultimate way. The man spent his resources and time in wasting the prodigals of another man. First of all, the weaker arguments raised by women's "released" characters in the climax are pathetic. The sexual needs of a woman are not an excuse for her to commit adultery and to betray her husband continuously, and worse, there are no more children. So in essence, his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations lead to the execution of the unjust.
