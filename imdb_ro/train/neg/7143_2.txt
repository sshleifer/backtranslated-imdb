This movie has some of the most wonderful cars I've ever seen in a movie and certainly the hottest women, but I should say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen ever. /> Here's the plot, and if you read it with a small inflection, you also have the role of acting. Begin, bring your characters, sing the hot woman (synchronizing your obvious lips). A musician or producer comes in, thinks she is wonderful asking her to race. He's coming back, too many bad memories. Flash to the war hero, back from the war, has more fights and becomes a film hero with the attitude that he is better than anyone. Get into the exotic fast car. Brother of the race, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut to get weapons from friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but it seems to really care for them). Of course you want to do this; Yes; I mean, you're really safe; Yeah, give me guns; you are really sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can not talk to you, be careful man, I love you. Now he goes to blow up the uncle's house that owns the car that his brother drove. She finds a woman, decides to save her, she moves away and does not finish killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Yes, you have to throw another scene with the bad people who come to beat people who do not really matter but can add a small plot. The race is not that exciting, of course it ends with two racing cars and one that should win throws a final surprise. Okay, I just saved $ 7.00. You can send me all my money, because I should have given you the same placards as this movie. Do not get me wrong, the cars are great, and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a terrible movie.
