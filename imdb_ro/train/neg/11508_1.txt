What possesses Guy Ritchie to remember Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new movie is a mess. There was another person in public when I saw her, and she left for about an hour in her. (I hope she asked for a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end was that I never came out of a movie. But I sat down with this piece of junk thoroughly crying that Madonna and Ritchie might think they did a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the act is atrocious, and the only beautiful thing in this movie is the landscape. Ritchie took Linei's film and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". This is a movie that you do not even miss the time watching Cinemax late at night. Time is too precious to be wasted on these crap.
