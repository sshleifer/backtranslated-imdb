Inappropriate. The PG rating that this film receives is another wrong step by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13, but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents are not fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a big mistake. I often found myself uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for children, but because it was completely out of the blue and useless. But whatever it is, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The Tower and the overall appearance of the film are the only rescue harps. Beautiful Kelly Preston and Alec Baldwin are always good at their role, even though Preston is almost too good for a role like this one. Children are conditioned and showcased, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that keeps me looking and not throwing things on the screen. Did I mention that there was an oversized cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely crying. I did not like Shrek's voice and I really believe that Myers should no longer be left near the kingdom of children's movies. Representing The Cat is a slight version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. Eventually, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if only for one day, he destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and struggle. Cat in Hat can be the worst movie for kids ever.
