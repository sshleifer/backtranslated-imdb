This gets just crushed because he sees David Hasselhoff. Well, let me give it. Compared with the garbage they call horror that's coming out today, this movie is not too bad. Has beautiful Leslie Cumming. He's hot, but he can not talk very well. There is a wonderful scene with her when supernatural is violated. He shows his body beautiful. Linda Blair is doing nothing here, not Hasselhoff. 3/10
