Let's put it this way. I got this movie. Get what the writer / director is trying to do. I understand the dialogue was meant to be dry and excited. I understand that the plot should have been outdated and outdated. That was what the writer / director was doing. A humor / comedy very very very dry. With all this understanding, I think the movie was sucked. It seems the writer / director is trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this movie. It had all the same features. Even the main character behaved similarly to Napoleon. But Napolean Dynamite was actually funny. The script worked. This movie is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me rephrase this. His only goal is to break Napolean Dynamite and try to capture that aspect and sense. Too bad it did not work.
