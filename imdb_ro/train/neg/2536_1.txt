My wife and I finished watching BÃ»su AKA The Booth. He fell asleep in some parts of the movie. I really would have liked to amuse her, but the unfortunate fact is that the voice of the main character is so loud and heavy that it was impossible to sleep. When our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner singing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. We hoped he would be hit by a five-minute bus in the movie. Do not misunderstand me, I like Asian horror cinema, but Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really does not make any sense. If you want a good Asian cinema, check out a story of two sisters or a mirror. Avoid the cabin like a plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.
