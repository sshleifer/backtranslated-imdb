I saw this movie for the first time not too much on TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the viewer's clich√© has never been more thorough. This viewer has seen little in this regard. I was puzzled by Lucy's infinite attraction (Lauren Bacall). Suddenly, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film, her character is more distracting than attractive. I think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would probably ignore Lucy rather than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was made during Humphrey Bogart's latest illness, and the weight of his damaged health may have affected her performance. Of course, part of this legacy from Lucy was to contrast her with a feeble woman, Marylee, played by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she engages in a sensual dance, while her father is routinely abject in a fatal heart attack, is far from the best scene in the movie. Malone's performances highlight the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue over the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Overall, though, I should say that I am not really a fan of the melody. The charismatic character behavior of the characters only makes a very unlikely story for my tastes.
