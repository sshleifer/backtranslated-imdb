The film is as fun as the sun's eye.Sheriff Pataki is a totally retardant who loves nothing better to do than to stand on his back fat making a smoke ring from his puffy cigarettes and drinking drinks while the doctor acts as a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucks everything what so-called "blood", which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch. Most of all the plot seemed very horrible even to call this piece of nonsense a movie. The rest of the characters in this movie are total waste of time, the end was terrible, the contours were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else should I tell you more? My advice is to take your Rabbi if you've already watched the movie. This movie can give you foam in your mouth if you have not received the updated photos.
