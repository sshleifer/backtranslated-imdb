Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy bloody, and the light disappears quickly. If it is not, then why else should you watch. five college children are enrolled to prepare an old home for the due date of the demolition. Problems arise automatically when a weird, homeless person asks, and the group is short of a few people. Then a murderer is at large. I was honest to say that I would enjoy this. He had a proper organization, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The movie is too slow and almost as silent as a library. Most of the act is below average, and moments of "point of view" are so old news. The well-known composer, Christopher Young, from "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" films marked this in a repetitive line that was made better for a TV movie. However, it looks bigger than the film deserves. So, besides Young and Zuniga, it's galling down the bottom of the cylinder.
