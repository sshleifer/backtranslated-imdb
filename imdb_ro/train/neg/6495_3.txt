I hired this movie amid what the trailer showed and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. If Jackson Pollack collaborated with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, that would be the end result. I do not think I saw a movie like this that made a LSD trip like an episode on Sesame Street. There are lots of pieces in which the characters intermittently in and out of reality, or different realities, and the film does not culminate in anything until the last 5 minutes, when it suddenly makes sense. I wrote a shaky review on my review movie blog, which basically offers everything and I will not do it here. It's a well-played cinematic piece and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and allow me to say this, if there is a redeeming feature of this movie, it's music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogues are incredibly good and incredibly bad at the same time. I enjoyed the parts of this movie, I really did, and once you get to the end, find out what's really going on. It is regrettable that you have to go over 2 hours of madness to get to an important point that minimizes the effect of the whole movie. I give it 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not the action, it's all.
