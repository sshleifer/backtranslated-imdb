This was by far the worst, low-budget horror movie I've ever seen. I'm an open guy and I always like a horror movie. In fact, when I rent movies, I'm looking for some underrated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, I think I know, I've seen a lot. But this movie was so terrible that it does not deserve a chicot. I thought I'd stop him in the first five minutes ... which he probably should have. There is nothing good about this, first of all, the crew of the suck3d A $$ camera. The intro was stupid as the end. Effective and special effects were terrible. Please do not look at this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
