This movie was much over-hyped. Many viewers, who thought this was "amazing," must have been in the old school movies, because the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something of the past, so I expected the blur to dream that the light on the characters would pass, but it all works. Basically, it was a movie that tries to mix the future with the past, and the two do not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could see the blue screen with which the actors worked. There are too many movies that do exactly what this movie does, so there is no reason for critics to walk this film by saying, "It's the biggest movie ever made." It's just stupid on a stick. It also did not contribute to the fact that the story line was so strange. I do not understand why Hollywood has agreed to produce this film, and I also do not understand how actors / actresses in this film are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost like everyone would read the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "Everything will be done on a computer." This was a movie that should have been in a cinematic network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I am very upset with me that they are paying money to see this. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
