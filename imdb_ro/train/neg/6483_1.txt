It was not good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality was from the memories we had of the previous movie, which contrasts with "new" personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously believed that the opening scene was Ariel's nightmare because of the absurd. It was serious. He reminded me of all the annoying characters on Disney Channel - everyone is overactive, and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without a real connection. The most disappointing part was horrible pieces - not amazing. In the original, Ariel had a stunning and powerful voice, and all the songs are appealing and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not at least creative; is like talking in an annoying voice of song - quite weak, disappointing. I do not have what I want to sing, they feel like I usually get from a Disney movie. It's like someone did not want to make this movie, so they barely made an effort. . . this movie would need a new line of stories, new and more appealing songs and warmth and excitement, without being annoying "Look at me, look at me! The mentality of this generation of Disney.
