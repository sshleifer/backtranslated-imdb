... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, NOT THIS MOVIE. If you want to look at the esquire document at "hood life" you're also in the wrong place. If you are looking for a piece of laugh, this is a real winner! The act is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example for this is certainly the officer investigating the driving car. I can tell you that he made the voice and operator 911 through the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box, it would probably sound like this guy. Yes, and the "zombies" have made the best impression of a snake, which is in the same position as FANTASTIC acting on the whole (note the sarcasm ... HOW HAVE NOT WIN OZCAR FOR BEST MAKE-UP) Quiro .... .. did not do any kind of direction. I felt like watching an improvisation track (the period is rather like the 1990 LA) Direction is still one of the worst scenarios that ever think of a movie. I have not heard such wonderful lines, such as an epic word that starts with the movie "F ** k!", Since Ice Grill was another "urban" thriller. This works, of course, in connection with the epic hip-hop soundtrack too! All 3 songs of it! In total, what the hell would you expect from a movie titled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I hired this movie with the full intention of laughing at each scene, and the boy gave it even more! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to meet with a bunch of boys and laughs at a horror movie (even ...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
