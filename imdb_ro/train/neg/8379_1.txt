As some of the other commentators have alluded to before, I'd like to know what the script really did, and it went, "Yes, that's ... This is the next movie we'll light green! "And whoever is that person should examine their head for real brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for destroying money to do this after reading the script, I would like to give you my e- mail and you may want to give some more money This movie is atrocious in every way Wayans are funny, at least they can be, they made some good movies and had incredible fun shows along the way But here , not only does the premise defy all the logic, it not only acts terribly, it is not just about the whole film offensive from the beginning to the end, not only that the direction is as amateur as you can find it, but actually I want to pay for this movie ... Maybe if it were free ... naaah, it would be a waste of time. I would usually be inclined to write a long, detailed review of why this movie is at t bad, but suffice to say that brevity let me speak. This is the smallest film of common denominator to do and is as unhappy as a heart attack. 0/10 .. make my top ten list of the worst movies of all time!
