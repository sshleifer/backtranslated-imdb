The funniest scene of this movie is probably when our rescuers get their medals, plates and nothing. So the basic idea is that the police overrun these gangsters by one million to one, but they are powerless because the wicked weapons are just a little bigger. I think the cops' ammunition is multiplying. They decided to film this documentary film with fake interviews and everything and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They talked as if they were armed with wrapped newspapers. Well, I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even when the situation is so profitable but you do not eat. And why the hell took 44 minutes to solve everything? I would say it is a very long time when you surrounded them and you are allowed to pull. They're ten feet, they did not hit anything. Then go and buy some bigger weapons to increase his heroism. And then yes, there you have, one of the cops hits someone. The bullet was probably hijacked by a lamp station or something like that. I had a good laugh, I think.
