I still can not believe this movie. They have so many unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe someone wanted to do it. The story is a joke, but in the sense of being fun, but more like no story at all. How can you mix a comedy with a robbery, a train robbery, a prison movie, city conspiracy, sex jokes, and an FBI agent? Can not. Besides the terrifying direction, the actors are most visible. I watched this movie and I thought, "Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be." (5 minutes later) Is Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true (5 minutes later) It can not be Donald Sutherland (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino This movie is too bad for all (No, no, can not be absolute Martin Sheen !!!) Not for 10 seconds of such a Then it's over and I've gone with my nerves So many good, Oscar-winning actors, usually convincing, in such a stupid, stupid and horrible movie Rarely I wanted to know how they came Actually, they could not get so much money, just an incredibly idiotic movie.
