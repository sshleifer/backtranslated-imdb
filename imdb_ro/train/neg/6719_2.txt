This is a wonderful idea for a movie, but unfortunately it does not turn out to be a great movie. What begins as a sweet and almost naked romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with Fluffee's spirals out of control in a bizarre combination of genres and a real plot of land with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even a curious "dash" of 400 BLOWS thrown to the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but, ultimately, this thin, well-produced film does not add anything. However, all the actors do a game of play with the material and there are some good laughs in the world behind the gay porn scene. <br /> <br />
