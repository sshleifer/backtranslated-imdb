Denzel is the only thing that's right in this movie. Perhaps once in an early stage, it was a better film. Someone has decided to cut off some action and make points at the beginning of the movie, providing the bulk of the story line in the first 5 minutes. This and the destruction of what accumulates in the rhythm and rhythm that the movie could have had before. <br /> <br /> So first you confuse and then put you. Dramatization pushes beyond disbelief. Of course, there is that sense of great injustice and anger that such films can manage to instill the viewers. So, if we look for that ... you break up.
