Comedy Central was successful with original programming using professional comics. Chapelle's show, Mencia's Mind, the Daily Show and the famous Colbert Report, all the latest professional comics and all are, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, solid performances. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comedies in business, I was expecting good things when I entered. I was so disappointed. funny, but given that the star is Silverman's caliber, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot and we hope the next week's show will be better. If not, call them better help as better writers for the show.
