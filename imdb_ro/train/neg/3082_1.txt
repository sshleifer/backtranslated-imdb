God, what did they think? !!!!!! Here's your warning about spoilers, even if I do not think it will really matter. You will not see this trash anyway. A group of handpuppets go after a group of really stupid people who go into a really stupid hunt for them to try to kill them, and the puppets complicate things by allowing them to live their really stupid fantasies. In other words, everything is very bad. You know it must be bad when both Mike and Bots can not save something! And they did not! I know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the "HIT" sign and hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad. All I can say is DO NOT WANT THIS CRUDE CARTRIDGE. YOU ARE NOT EYES.
