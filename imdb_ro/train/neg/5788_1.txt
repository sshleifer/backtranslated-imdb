So Mr. Agram's company (who is involved in a dubious deal with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a terrible smell by a Mr. Carl Macek. What is this terrible smell-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek has made three animated Japanese SF series (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada) by adding TONS dialogue - firmly believing that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - edited the whole lot hard for violent content, added some mumbo jumbo metaphysics, called it using some of the worst voice actors this part of the act of Hell (Reba West's song was - and still is - unbearable and a total scandal, especially in comparison with Mrs. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity issues and plot holes. Of course, the mecha were very interesting to look (especially those in the "Macross Saga") and the parts of the parcel that remained untouched were good. But what was good with Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "voice talent" he had recruited. It was because of efforts and efforts (unbelievable - why? I would be too daring to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who finally came to the wind of real understanding and compared the originals to Robotech, now want us never to be exposed to Robotech. Originals are much better, naturally and have much more meaning. Robotech did something to do: it caused legionary creator of anime Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign to protect the Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and unrecorded reprocesses produced by people without talent like Carl Macek.
