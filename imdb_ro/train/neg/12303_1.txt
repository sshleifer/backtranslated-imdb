This movie is so bad, it's good - in an unintentionally funny way. I could not look, I laugh so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul interprets Emily Wendell, the wife of the oppressed priest, who falls hard on Luke (Corey Sevier), a vagabond and mysterious guide that I finally learned in prison; The only thing that Sevier guilts about is that he is acting badly! Remember, it's not worse than the other actors. You have the feeling that actors do not have the idea of ​​being in a very horrible movie; they play straight. Everything about the movie is bad: act, script, love scenes, rhythm, plotting, choosing music. Climate scenes are just ridiculous - first of all the church shootings, then the final words of Luke to Emily - we laughed at the laughter. Obviously, Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab abdomen in jail, and we'll see to see a lot of his naked torso. This is probably the climax of the movie.
