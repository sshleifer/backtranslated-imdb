Warning: contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the lemma above. The second scene is the spinning center of the whole action. Knowing the end makes the movie boring. Moreover, other plots are revealed because the story goes on and on again. And that became more frustrated. To compensate for the lack of suspense as a result, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the characters are. And oh yes, they have much to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, moreover, he deceives his wife, moreover, intends to rob his father more?, His wife is wrong with his brother more ? he does not regret his complicity with his mother's death, moreover, is he a serial killer, more? etc etc is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how could have a top job. And why did not his wife leave him before? On the other hand, I am very pleased with the performance of actor Hoffman. Even here PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spending on this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it makes no sense, why should I take care of the clever characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic character (at least pleasing). <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we should take care of the suffering of the widow's father, without knowing anything about the parents' life before the crime.
