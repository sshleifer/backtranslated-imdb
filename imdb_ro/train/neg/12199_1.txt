- My sister and I watched that movie now. I laughed at the deaf. Can u imagine on the covers there is an Oscar nomination ?? - first of all, the musician mixed up about 4-5 different style of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character is moving ... --- the main character Silvester does not fit there. he looks like the Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are all but Russian girls :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. plane called charter painted in black. <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea when Rambo goes to jump from the plane, but is he left? rope mix 3. a face? the best scene is when he dies. He has a lot for him. has it known for centuries? he cries for her, ... my God samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? His bag is always full of arrows? I did not notice a scene they collect - but I saw the scene where the arrow is in the soldering head in Vietnam - it's very important 5. how many rocket helicopters can hold ??? (real one) I saw 4, but Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. The main part. what helicopters of the special Russian army do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. the first scene when he entered the Vietnamese camp ... his first idea was to release the refuge that sits on the tree on the open space "wow, what idea then again: 1. With the knife u can cut the iron wire? Do not know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer is looking at many movies in the war.) 2. Mortar - using to hit a man running? My God, the Americans really have to learn about the weapons! World II)
