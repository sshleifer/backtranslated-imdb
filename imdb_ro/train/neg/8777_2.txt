Okay, I tried to get rid of the fact that in selling EVP as real, the movie actually lied to me from the beginning. I thought about the hell, I do not believe in the vampires, but I still loved Dracula, so I could live with it. However, even with this I accepted that the movie is not very good. She did and acted competently, but she does not catch you at all. There are a few moments of "jump" and I looked at them and I thought "yes, I did not expect to do that", without actually jumping the slightest. Also, resolution does not make sense. If the force behind this is capable of doing what seems to be, then why the hell has to use a proxy? In addition, the final legend was absurd. They obviously put it there as part of "giving the credibility of the film claiming it's all real," but to really work it must be at first. But they can not start it, because then they make the plot away ... sticking it to the end just made it pull out like a big finger.
