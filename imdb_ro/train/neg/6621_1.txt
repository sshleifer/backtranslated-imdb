Something else must have happened very well even when the director perceived this plot. The film, which was supposed to be the remake of one of the most beloved films in cinematography, fails to deliver in every aspect of filming. The best of the artists could not also recover the tuning, which means the movie itself was a serious mistake. Editing is poor. Direction is bad. Taking action is from this world (omg)! Characters that look like scary people force to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. I would not watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with him.
