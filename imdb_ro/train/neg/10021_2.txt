The worst movie I've seen from Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, nothing! Action sequences seem more like a series of Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up commercials sewn together. Very influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. I do not have much expectations, but I forget that this movie is an exasperating experience that makes you wonder, "What did these guys think? The only thing you remember after you forgot it is that Kareena is anorexist, a bikini. The reason I did not give a rating of "1" is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood proves to be wrong.
