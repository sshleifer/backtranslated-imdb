The plot and the characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and unclear. The fact that Fulci has filled the whole fog film does not help. On the other hand, everything is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite fun, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he gets stuck in the new guy in one minute of screen and has a bunch of women on the side. Although he shows his anti-social tendencies by randomly placing an arrow in some poor b ***** d who think only of their own business The images of the blood or gore that flow are receiving more attention than the characters but what you want from Fulci. Perhaps he had destroyed his career, but he was not really worse than Zombie. It's worth a rent if you like the horrible blows in Italy or you're desperate for sword and witchcraft or something bizarre. How do you sleep by the fact that someone sucks in a pit of two legs from the head and yells for help?
