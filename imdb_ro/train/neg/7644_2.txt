It's been a long time since I've seen a movie so bad last time. The actress is very young, the story is terribly dull and I'm at a loss in terms of execution. It was completely non-original. Oh, and this is just as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood a pregnant Schwarzenegger woman! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV show - where the hell are you?) made it right - the distribution was 80% of what we do - the actors forgotten. If they were hoping to launch a career, I think this could never happen in their resume! The scenario had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and should obviously remain an actor) fired it. Fred Durst was the only one who looked better than any of the others. I'm sorry, but if you want to follow this, I recommend turning you back to something less traumatic, because it's not only a total waste of time, but also a poor example of bad cinema.
