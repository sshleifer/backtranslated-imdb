Absolutely the worst movie by Burton, which seems to get worse with every movie he leads. A miserable script loaded with slings is just the first of many things that can not be brought to this movie. This is the kind of movie where whenever something happens, you'll be sure someone will scream "lost your gun!" or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is really terrible and so is Wahlberg, who can not play this right and be convincing. The very beautiful effects and photography, but the poor music in John Williams' mattress by Burton's cock, Elfman. Heston appears in a nonsensical scene to take out the most famous capture phrases in the first film. Very poor results. If someone else has also seen Sleepy Hollow, it's likely that Burton's low quality will be noticed. I heard that this project was produced by others, and that Burton was brought as a director, in which case his judgment should be called into question. But I think he allowed any possible vision he could have previously had in his career; the evidence exists in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow," he could not decide what kind of movie he made, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you Do you think it was kind of a monster rally movie (which are never scary, as horror fans know). The film failed neither horror nor comedy, because it was so schizophrenic that no style has been developed to align the two. "The Planet of the Monkeys" is the same, and the result comes more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than sci-fi. He also fell into the river several other "big" directors, trying to satisfy the entire audience possible. Burton's Word, if you are there - choose something and do it right, or use a certain style to do it all together (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you can withdraw because people like me the fans of your movies will stop.
