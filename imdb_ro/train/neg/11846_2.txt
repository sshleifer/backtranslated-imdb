After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or about the fact that the cinema sound system might be faulty. At least for the first half of the movie, it is extremely difficult to understand what someone says about background music 20 and the scratch of the sound track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but not so - he was the director. I was told that the subject of my complaint was an essential part of making the film. Music and sound had to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. These days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see this movie, the sound score will be the same. So, apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find elsewhere), sound distortions are themselves a good reason to give this film a wish. You will hear only the distorted noise of the sound track and certainly not cat lick.
