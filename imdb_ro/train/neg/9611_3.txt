There are so many crazy things about this movie that I can not name just a few: <br /> <br /> The character of BOGART: 1. His name? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'm leaving it, boy, makes Humphrey sound good.) 2. His long, clean hair and bad burns. 3. The Black Man is up, full of spurs! 4. I'm not sure what the shadow of the lack they made to wear it, but there is not one too flattered. The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lips do not give him any favor, either. 2. Man is swallowed by the hat during the whole movie! Could not find a hat to fit it? Even a Few? !!?! 3. His trousers are too tight in the back. 4. He blows the smoke off the gun too many times if you know what I mean and I think you do. If you are a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney, and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a vest, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. EVENTS CAN BE COVERED! (I mean, when I'm not bored.) In all fairness, I admit that Westerners are my least favorite genre, but I've seen much, much better than that. <br /> <br /> At a comedy level, or as high, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, the viewer is careful. Therefore, you see this only if a) you have to see every Western one there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments I remember you. Uau ?? ..
