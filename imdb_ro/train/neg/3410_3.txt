Yes, this movie has children going to a space camp and it starts pretty well as the kids meet each other and learn the ropes. Then I introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986 because they have nothing with this type of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes a friend with a robot, and the robot pays the baby's goodness by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp in outer space with a very limited amount of oxygen and radios that do not have the signal to reach space. This camp is also not very fun, because these children are being put into a real training, and the instructors take them all for unsuccessful missions or do not do the right thing. Give them a rest, they're there for fun, not to become astronauts, you just give them the space flight experience, not a military camp like the camp. However, you will see Joaquin Phoenix in a rather early role. So, eventually, a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, could also have children fight space aliens besides everything that happened in movie, as the movie would have done a bit more pleasant, at least for me. Perhaps for some others, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face hooked with strange, extraterrestrial creatures.
