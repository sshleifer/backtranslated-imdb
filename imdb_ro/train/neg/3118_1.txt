I felt the movie was dry ... very disappointing no plot .. expected something to happen and nothing dried out like a bone .. a waste of money .. One of Robins Williams's worst movie .. if you do not think me wait a few months it will be on DVD because this seems to be a model for movies that do not do well in theaters are like rents before the end of the year ... This is one you will not want to see or Tell me why I spent my money! Besides, because it was a new movie, there were only 8 people watching him ... That was one Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that more enthusiasm or something was needed to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were also very low, you could not hear what they were saying.
