They show this on a network outside the network. It's crap. While it's not as bad as B's movies on the Sci-Fi network on Saturdays, but still a bunch of nonsense. Action is acceptable. Plot and writing are quite substandard and the rhythm is completely too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like a part of the movie in which they pack things before credits - not the tip of the film, the outcome. Also, large portions of the film looked to age for the age range they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worthy of being pursued. Save your time. It does not even deserve the time to watch it for free.
