Ah, Channel 5 of Mexican natives t.v. Every day, at 2:00, they shoot horror films from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. It was "Come Back to the Cabin Near The Lake" movie that broadcast yesterday. I'm sorry I looked at it. The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a popular budget builder on a regular basis and was well accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentional, and attempts to mimic the original. Ugh. The story is really bad in the sense of the word. The film at some points looks like a soap opera due to absurd dialogues, cinema and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice is: avoid this at any cost. It's a movie that no one should see. Not even for mediocre film lovers. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
