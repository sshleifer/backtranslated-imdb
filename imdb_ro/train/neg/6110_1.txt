Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa, studying something or another. He follows him (how?) And tells him the gentlemen's stories about a giant monster, whose roar in the evening can be heard throughout the jungle. (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue of the film), who saves him from the bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving him enough time in this two-hour agonizing to break up while a horny monkey looks and cheers. Normally, I am very open to different opinions on any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Note: Newsday called it "impossible," which is the best summary with a single word I can think of. The Maltin Guide shows that it is almost worth thinking about a lower rating than BOMB).
