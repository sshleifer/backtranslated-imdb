The two things are good about this movie are two unknown celebrities. First of all, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and slim, with a look that still contains her body today, steals from the very beginning what is in it and that is. She is obviously only starting from the fact that her action has improved with her future projects. Secondly, Christopher (Chris) Young's famous composer's score is the one that keeps this stinker from getting a star ... yes, I know that one star is not much, but in this case movie, is a lot. The rest is the terrible terrible horror of a couple of students who are trying to clean a home that was broken down, escaped one by one by an amazing killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where this happens. Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
