She is only receiving the third billing (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but it was David Niven's first lead role and he is charmingly stupid as Bertie Wooster, Jeeves' master (only in name), PG Wodehouse . As an adaptation, it is more like a decay of 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian trip. And that's too bad, because the interaction between Treacher & Niven is not far from the mark. Unfortunately, the "tropes" in the movie "B" and the forced comedy develop very noisy even in a short period of 57 minutes. The next year's watch (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even farther from the brand, without Bertie being in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forcing him to play.
