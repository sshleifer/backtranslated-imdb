I have seen this with a growing sense of restlessness. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these distinguished men in their attempt to escape the Devils Island? And what was he doing there first? I mean, I know God is working in mysterious ways but helping thieves, killers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness, and heart changes in such a terrible location ... In any case, it's hard to find a nice movie. Regardless of what Gable had by charm missing in this portrait of a very selfish man, Crawford is as bold as she always was, that is, for me, not at all, and the whole aspect of the film makes it look as if it were made . years before. Compared to contemporary movies such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," this seems prehistoric.
