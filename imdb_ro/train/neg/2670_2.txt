There is no way on the ground that you will take care of any of these characters. A bunch of midwifery kids who take drugs take some drugs at a party and get off with each other and back up. I just saw this on TV and I did not think it was a "movie" as such, but rather a post-'This Life 'indulgence that does not have any resonance or proper drama. Things of this kind will be made available over time, unfortunately, illegal "lifestyle" nonsense, which takes too much seriously. Has David Baddiel in him and the bird in "Cold Feet", you know what to expect. There was a lot of stuff about this in 2000, it was a particularly brittle state of mind ... "they are educated and do drugs, friends, but quite dysfunctional and incestuous, it sounds wonderful!" This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie comedy-gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have a taste, this will upset you to the point of violence.
