Dark Rising is your typical bad movie, obviously produced by horror / sci-fi / fantasy. It has a strange, inexplicable plot with holes so large that you can fit an elephant. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was happening, but it does not matter, he was a simple demon hunter who turns from the hell's dimension to saving the story of the caravans with the added confused stuff about witches and a bad book with plotting elements and characters that have no meaning or disappear entirely for no reason. The act is bad, but there is no honest thing to do with this scenario we guess. There are some topless scenes, which is probably the only reason this bad movie has been made (like many other bad movies). Give her a license if there is nothing else on T.V.
