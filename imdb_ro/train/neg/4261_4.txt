Pathetic. This happens when the director comes to work just because someone pays it. <br /> <br /> Intentions were good, great locations and settings for an epic-sized movie. But the show, damn it! I swear, in some photos you can see a background excerpt that looks into the room or looking for actors because nobody told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". The battle scenes are so bad that you ask - are these real people? It could have done more damage only by mutual embrace. In slow scenes you can see people on the battlefield walking around or just standing, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the foreground action is underlined in a way. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not really. Dialogues are foolish, the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong's action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on screen in the best scenario, the end result of this enormous effort is a round round laser disk in the thin lid placed on the shelf from the video store.
