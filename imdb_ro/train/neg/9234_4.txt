Fix it today, this movie would be a dark and very disturbing comedy. Stalking, obsession, and a network of lies and manipulations are given in a gloss of 1948 not-not-cute harmlessness. Drake interprets the stalker, an unbeatable user, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays the pursued victim, alternately angry and unseen. Very disturbing; I could not look at classical romance with the same suspension of mistrust ever since. <br /> <br />
