Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's like someone gave a dollar-dollar budget to a third pupil in autism and told me: "Make me a secret service movie." Editing is ridiculous, cinema was random at best, every single syllable of the dialogue was completely delayed, and the direction ... was there even a director there? Everything was just as useless, blades and useless ... and by accident ... and blades. Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the worst thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you enjoyed this piece, you will also enjoy it; Determination, Dark Blue and Partial Partial Lobotomy.
