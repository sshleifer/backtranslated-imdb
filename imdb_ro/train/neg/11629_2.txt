** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, does not have a plot, and basically it was only done to see the stars portrayed. The most suspicious scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi was in the shower and then we watched his TV playing on the PSYCHO shower stage. This movie expects users to think that the character of Naseeruddin Shah has a memory good enough to remember where some fires have been shot and how many! *** SPOILER GET STARTED *** At the end, the killer shakes Shabana Azmi's courage long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to stand up and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** It's a bit humorous (just a little bit) at the beginning of the director's interview and expressed the members who were insulting one another and they heard Shabana Azmi exclaiming, "Oh sh-t!" <br /> <br /> In general, baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of ********** (2 of 10)
