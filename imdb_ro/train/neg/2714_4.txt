Years 60 (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released on video / DVD as a full-length movie) about the insults of the 1960s, seen through the eyes of a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is driven by Dutton's excellent performance as Rev. Willie Taylor and equally spreads the story of families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway, and the black family is completely forgotten in half bored, incoherent and bold. RATING: 4 out of 10. Unrated (subsequently rated PG-13 for video / DVD release).
