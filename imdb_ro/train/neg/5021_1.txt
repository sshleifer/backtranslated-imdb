This is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious, and the hammer of action. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school project, but it certainly played as one. It has no great success in its central intention of trying to appear as a single continuous taking. Horizontal camera cameras are a cheap and non-original way of hiding pieces.
