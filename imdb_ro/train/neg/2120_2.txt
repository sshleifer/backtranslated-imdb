I thought I'd be pretty melancholic, especially when I see a wonderful and pungent movie. But not for that (which surprised me!) And it's also very surprising to see how many people have appreciated this movie so much. There are some disturbing facts in the films: 1. Despite the blame - Ben's real intention to save seven lives to redeem the past, it seems to me worrying that the film seems to encourage this type of suicide action. Some people can perceive this heroic action and others think cowardly, in the end it was a disturbing action for me. The story line of the film is over-dramatized, but the logic is too simplified. From a medical point of view, matching the blood type should be an organ donor. By the end of the movie, I found out that Emily had a type of back blood that limited her chance to get the donor in the short term. However, Ben seemed to have the rare type of blood, just like his own who allowed her to be her donor and, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only her heart but also her kidneys, cornea and bone marrow, which in all cases require not only a matching blood type, but also a tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the jelly venom he kills? However, some of the disturbing facts outlined above, we hope will help you reconsider your plan to watch this movie. If you go for a film of soap-film work, go for it. But you're looking for smart entertainment, give it a miss!
