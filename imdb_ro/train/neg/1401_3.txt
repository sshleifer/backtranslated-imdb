Someone mentioned editing. This is wrongly edited and what began as somewhat interesting has become misunderstood. To begin with, tell us what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choices for the type of experiment they are involved in? And what is it testing? There seems to be a big plan that an agency will exploit. The actor is pretty bad. Everybody is moving. Everybody keeps secrets. They often mention that if it were not the money, they would have closed it. There is a disturbed minister who gets rid of the scriptures. Again and again. But again, the biggest suspension is the lack of putting a playground for the actors. There are some really cheesy items. Small rooms and sitting rooms. The awesome wallpaper (was the wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it did not seem to go anywhere.
