My roommates and we almost shortened our TV from the many excuses we made while watching this hilarious piece of pseudo-zen dreck of itself. I've read about this campfest all the time, and I've been scanning local night TV shows for those years looking for this turbulent. A few years ago, ABC's local affiliate was known for having performed wonderful moves for its weekend filming (eg, "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40, on a Saturday night (5 years ago) there was! I had over 15 people and I did not disappoint! "See Andy Griffith as the worst and most ungrateful bad guy from Jaye Davidson in" Stargate "! William Shatner uses a variety of things over his head that looks a bit like human hair (or something organic for that). the inexpensive jaw in the 1970s psychhombus that makes "chicken soup for the soul" sound like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel Content that any decade was better than in the 70's For those who I still read ... the plot surrounds a bunch of mid-level middle classes who decide to suck them up to the boss's chief (Griffith), joining him on a cross-desert race that stretches across California and Mexico. "They all wear leather garments, looking at Christopher Street more than anything else." Along the way, they stop at a Cantina, get drunk, smoke the joints (Robert Mike Brady's vision "smokes a joint" is an image that does not you'll soon forget), start a fight, try rape, and behave like a bunch of suburban middle class offsets. Although I have a great copy that I recorded from TV I want it to be released on the video, so that the whole world can enjoy the half-baked marigold.
