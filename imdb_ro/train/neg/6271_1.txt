There are no words to explain how bad WEEKEND NIGHTMARE is. It simply defies the description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that fall into the mouths of the victims, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so impressive that it's amazing. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! They do not do this stuff. The computer also controls things like machines, although there is nothing to link the computer to the vehicle. The film is a total garbage. Surreal bad garbage. Spectacular, a unique trash of evil. There are lots of sex scenes thrown here and there that are not very hot or erotic. There is even a scene where a woman makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantua, which rolled me on the floor. Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. There, with BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to understand what's going on.
