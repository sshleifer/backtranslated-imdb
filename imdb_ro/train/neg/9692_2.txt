Bonjour Tristesse has a theme similar to "the wedding member". to understand, a possessive daughter tries to prevent the formation of a relationship between a loved family member and an interlocutor. While critics love the "Wedding Member," I find Julie Harris half an hour and an adenoid adventure that she embellished in everything she was. This shows the irritating idiots, rich as last year in Marienbad, but this is a trip. <br /> <br /> In this movie sequence Preminger develops, but the characters do not. In the first 30 minutes, he is pleased to fade the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, which makes uncomfortable sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg can not deliver the necessary depth to the party. Kerr shoots and turns the movie into "Endless Love". Seberg's troubled reward is something of Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really want someone else than Niven in his role. He spends so much time normalizing British Orthodox behavior in all his films, he never gets around the character. In the most memorable sequence, an evening dancer becomes free for all in a port. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for the empty exercise, "Conformist." Kerr is on board to clutter his hands and to represent another major pain (as in Black Narcissus, Iguana Night, King and I, Heaven knows Mr. Allyson, tea and sympathy, etc.). Indeed, Kerr was a horrible actress. I want every movie with her to end with a fatal accident, or even better, start with one. People who do not feel comfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
