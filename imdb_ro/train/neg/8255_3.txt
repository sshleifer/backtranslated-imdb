At least it is not full of violence or puffiness. It is also not full of thought or a smooth story. This story had a potential, but the director seems to have lost the green spot. The story is divided and extinguished in strange directions without any conclusion. I also do not think the director spent much time around a golf club in the country. Some of the representations are absurd. Not too busy.
