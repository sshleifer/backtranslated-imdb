There are two points that I must clarify from the beginning. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscar really was all about this year. It was the way of the Academy to show people that they are not racist and have never been. They wanted to eliminate all the preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is useless to make remarks about the show, because indeed, what difference will it make? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I'm tired of Oscar! I will not watch the show again. Every year I do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when they should be Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it and you will agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released was not nominated. And with regard to this year, the bad choices were everywhere! Bas Lurhmann does not receive a nomination for "Best Director"! You're kidding!! "A Beautiful Mind" Prepares for "Best Makeup" ???? "Training Day" becomes nominated? The film was terrible and it seemed that Washington did not even perform, all that proved to be, knows how to use four-letter words! That won the prize for! Remove the tongue and bet that he almost plays himself! I liked "Gosford Park," but I did, but why do seven nominations? And how could not give Altman too Altman! I mean, if I just give people a prize to eliminate any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public eye for 32 years and no Oscar! There have been many, many things that have bothered me about this year's Oscar, but I will live with him as long as I never have to see another show again! The pinnacle (and only) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first ever appearance at the awards show. This will be one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
