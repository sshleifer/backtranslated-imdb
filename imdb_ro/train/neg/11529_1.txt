Yes, unfortunately, I went over the DVD and found it was incredibly terrible. First, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if a dork in an orange hat named "Orange Sherbert" is the best creative idea that these guys might come up for a character, then it certainly should not be in the scene of the movie. Maybe "costumes", bad interviews and basically there is no "fighter" on this whole disc with any kind of charity. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots who play easily and playfully together on a trampoline. They care to chicote together all the time, also making the experience look more like a child's play period than a "deathmatch". <br /> <br /> Practically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a clone quite devoid of Backyard Wrestling. Just in place of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we have a trampoline, chirping children, TERRIBLE audio and a guy named Orange Sherbert. Combat fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's terrible.
