How low can one sink while trying to recover an old glory? ST: HF will be glad to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are accustomed to seeing what you did for a good Star Trek show, DO NOT follow this. <br /> <br /> -podge, the portraits of the actors in their characters are weak and, especially, the design work is just the dog. Like seeing the powerful captains, do not look here! Like the strong attitude of the Federation? Forget it here! The Float fleet is mocked by badges wearing SPIKES in their hair. While an apparently psychic-minded captain overturns about two minutes after the opening of the show, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange a meeting with an engineer. It degrades from there. No, even the uniforms do not fit for the sake of good. They are too small or too big, with collars to the chest, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mix with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. Discipline and strict tradition of any of the missing originals in this production up to the crossing rails! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve slightly in each season. OK, I get it back. Who uses CG inexpertly? Designers of this show. Do not bother with this, it will hurt your Star Trek sense, as it did to me. Not even throwing back to previous shows can save this catastrophe. I cried open when I looked at it, probably because my eyes blew and almost broke my head. So bad.
