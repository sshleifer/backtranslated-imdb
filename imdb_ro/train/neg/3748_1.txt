... but this does not work and I am surprised to see how many people she considers good. On what grounds? There are some weak suggestions here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are generally interesting because they create a sense of confusion, and yet I'm very playful when I do that. There is a visual sense, there are subplots, characters, ideas, etc. But this is boring and yes, useless. Because anything to explore is either "small" or too far, or simply said earlier in a superior manner. Just Lynch explores DV, nothing more should be treated like this. 1/10
