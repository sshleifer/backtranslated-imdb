(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely terrible movie. First of all, he has that guy in the middle. I think she made a career to play super-eager fathers. It was the first time that he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but after 10 minutes they managed to do it again! And so it works, the movie moves in real time. At some point, I began to imagine that it was a few days later, until I remembered that the story line was just the next day ... in the early afternoon yet! I'm not sure who this couple should be in real life. First of all, they are portrayed as a couple of Manhattan yuppie who grew up and had a baby. But I drive an old blue Volvo. These types have ceased to lead Volvos decades ago. Today they run Prius. But in 2002, I'm sure they still did not run Volvos. OK, then it's Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a little magical Wendigo statue and tells him of his strong magic. Okay, we still make old Indian mysteries. Just to take him home, to cross over every Indian statue in their tourist traps in New York City. American Indians are portrayed in an unseen fashion for decades in this movie! Oh, and about Wendigo. It's not really the cause of horror. He does not kill the child's father, which is the most horrible thing in the movie ... he was just killed by a hickan with a predator and a great power rifle. Wendigo just comes out at the end of the movie to take revenge on the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed Wendigo was a little mad at his father, maybe because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo must have been happy that the father was killed ... but ... and so it goes ... insulting, boring and meaningless. There is no reason to watch this movie at all.
