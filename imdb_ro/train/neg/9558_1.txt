I thought this was a continuation of some sorts, and is meant to be original since 1983. But a sequel does not take the original plot and destroy it. We actually had very little to expect this movie, but we lost only 95 minutes of life. Without suspense - I actually feel clairvoyant, acting poor and so full of technical errors, so like a geek computer, I could not believe it. They tried to make a combination of a generic war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low-budget TV movie. You do not see this movie, it's a complete loss of time. Instead, get the original. The theme is still valid. Do not leave too much power in a car. And action and plot are more demanding and convincing.
