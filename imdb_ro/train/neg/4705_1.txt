My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I met a bunch of my friends who are NBB busts and they had a big fire and I took a CD with their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch pictures of band members and cast them into the fire and danced a happy piece around the burning stuff while singing "Ding Dong The Witch is Dead". This was the best thing about the show and this show is bad with a God chapter this show is shit. I hate so much. Get rid of the massive car. Just suck! You've really destroyed the entire channel! Without any crime or something, but you have to get a life, that is, who makes a stupid show with a fresh singer who can not even sing! You call yourself horrible, and you have to get a life like a hobos or something, except for Roselina. She's very cute. But still, you will react!
