I hated this silly every Friday as part of tgif, and constantly sucked out stupidly every week. If you want to see something funny, watch "No On Would Tell" With Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really hilarious, it shows exactly why nobody ever goes to a good career after making a terrible television show. This show makes me sick, I hate those kids and the sagetous bob has to go from a bridge to do that. I've seen funny things everywhere, but here. I wrote 10 lines! Look at the "full house" to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.
