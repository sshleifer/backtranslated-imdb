This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some movies. It's passed like an art movie, but it's really a piece of garbage. It's a quality of redemption, the beautiful tango dance, but that can not compensate for Sally Potter's obvious disgusting tribute. The film of this film is non-existent and I guarantee you will start laughing to the end. Especially where she starts singing. It's absolutely unreal.
