This may not be Mandy Schaffer's latest film. Someone, do something! : D: D: D: D: D: D: D: D <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < / p> <p> The brother was pretty well done, and he did not even get into the movie until halfway up and please, put Mandy in several movies, she's too beautiful to bury his career at a young age. , first of all, how Traci continued to awaken at the very moment of melodrama, to see everything he should have seen and never seen in return, was very disturbing Hollywood: please do not give up the villains a perfect luck that ends exactly when the climax is high, it's great Write better scripts so you do not need to use that device with blade plotters. When your scenario is not good enough to get you up without it, then do not produce it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Carmen would not have fallen for that fake trick that Traci shot. He was already on Traci with his finger. Worse writing / pointing me there. We could destroy this movie, but merit forbids it. Actually, I did not hate him as much as the others. It simply had little reason to do, unless it was simply a vehicle to show the wonderful Mandy. Oh, and for anyone who did not think she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say she was not sexy? One or another of us needs glasses and I do not think it's me. More MANDY. (Do not be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - though I'd like to see it again ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I say that I hope Mandy makes more movies? <- D
