First of all, I agree with a little bit of Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His deliberation in fact of the interesting counterpoint is what makes the man hit the university campus. He meets with lies, hurriedly, pragmatically. He does not care about the current political style (inappropriate biopartisantism) and puts his eyes on the far left as well as on the far right, chasing for both good reason. Unfortunately, the movie itself is a duddy. In fact, I would not even call this documentary, but just a collection of speeches. Watching "The Rebel without a break" is no different from watching a speaker on a 3-hour segment on CSPAN. There are no room movements, no changes, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative. From a technical point of view, production is strictly amateur. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we can not hear Noam speaking, sometimes we can not hear the questions posed by those present. When Noam speaks seldom, we are allowed to see the reactions of the public, unless we gave a brief blow to his wife, who apparently participates in each of his speeches, and he pride himself with pride every time we see it. /> I can not recommend this movie and would say that it's probably best to check your recorded discos on the tape or CD to listen to them in the car. 4 out of 10 stars ... and I have a generous mood today.
