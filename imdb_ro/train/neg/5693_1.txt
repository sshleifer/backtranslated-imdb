I can not believe in the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, badly executed and badly performed movies I've ever seen. And the plot was completely absurd (sp?). Does she start to deal with him while she is tied to the chair? - Puh rent. The worst thing was that he was not really bad in a good, ridiculous way. Very terrible - I did not realize why they even bothered to show HBO. I thought Belushi was incredibly stupid - very incredible as an "eccentric" man. idk, I could go on - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that keeps me looking is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go and what's wrong. And the end did not disappoint even in its depth! "you live by the sword, you die of the sword ..." ridiculous.
