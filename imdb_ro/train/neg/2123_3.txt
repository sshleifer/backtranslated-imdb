I go to UCSB and take some classes along with executive producer Alison Anders. She is a gorgeous teacher and director, so whatever puts her name, I thought it had to be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara Film Festival seemed a good choice. While this film contained some beautiful and cinematic pictures, the lack of storyline and coherence really took her away from everything she was trying to accomplish. My main problem was that this was the first film of someone and you could say clearly. Inappropriate action and an even worse scenario prevented this film from descending to the ground. The soundtrack had a pleasant music that gave the feeling that the main characters struggled to cope with the sadness that led to his departure and returned to the place where he grew up. I have to say that despite some of the best crafts of the film, the lack of story and performance prevents it from being good.
