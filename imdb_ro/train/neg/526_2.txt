Almost as tiring as to read, the Evening is a prodigal failure ... until Meryl Streep walks in and shows the other members of the casting quietly how to do such things. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as Death Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Perhaps, if Vanessa and Claire had changed their roles, we'd seen the vibe of the young Ann who gave her the entr√©e to the world of the story, and we could have imagined that the bigger Ann died. <br /> <br /> We hoped Michael Cunningham's addition to writing credits would make offending stories easy, but unfortunately. He gave me a headache.
