He had all the clich√©s of such films and no substance. The intrigue did not get anywhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker because I was following it. Production was good; however, the script and the role were the quality of the B. Casting was poor because there were good actors mixed up with crazy actors. Good actors have not kept their own attitudes and raised the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. are playing cartoons in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for mindless fun, I still would not recommend this movie.
