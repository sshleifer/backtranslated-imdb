this film is made for the Asian / Chinese market, especially aimed at fans of Jay Chou, one of Asia's greatest musical stars. Jay Chou is a very talented writer / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he has appeared in several high-budget productions ("The original D", "The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he won both the golden horse award (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong film prize for the original D film. The sustained distribution is very well chosen, which appeals to all of China. The cast included many cinema / TV actors, singers, and even sports commentator (Huang Jianxiang of China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. The biggest mistake is that Chu took over as both director and writer. She has a reputation for making superficial and non-brains based on incoherent scripts. With its poor story of direction and lam, all the talented distribution, fantastic visual effects and tons of production money was wasted. However, the terrible movie has successfully earned over $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asia, which has made it one of the greatest box office successes in Asia. The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see money and talents being wasted, or if you simply accompany your children who are fans of Jay Chou.
