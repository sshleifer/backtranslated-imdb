Humm, an Italian film played by David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, did not expect too much to be honest, and in fact, I took even less than I expected. It does not mean that this movie is the worst I've seen, because I looked at things worse than that, but the plot was often confusing and uninteresting, and some good gore scenes are the only one which saves this. Besides, you will love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I just want to see "Troll 3" by the same director, sure it will not be worse than that.
