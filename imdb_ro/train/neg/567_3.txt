This movie is one of the most terrible movies ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie? He's a singer, not an actor, what? Did he kill guitar vampires? And what about the terrible plot? God, my God, this movie sucks. Finally, the vampire queen, played by the eternal vampire, Arly Jover (Blade), surrounded by a vampire army, but when the "fantastic" hunters arrive, only 4 vampires are left! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They remain in the sun ??? And what about Grand Mare, when Bon Jovi hits his head with a rifle? This is actually a "NO". In "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes is not a single vampire killed with a SHOTGUN ??? This is indeed a lack of originality!
