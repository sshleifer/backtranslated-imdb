<br /> <br /> What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few surviving survivors. He has to eat bugs and insects, or anything else, after a poisonous war or something, almost erased the entire human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth, still capable of living in comfort, we will call him "Big Chief Head", has a great quest to prevent the release of seeds of secret spores. Looks Big Chief I know he's the last person on Earth who knows that these spores really exist. Spores are located away from any living soul and are very protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The big boss knows that secret spores will remain in their sheltered secret receptacles. So he makes a plan to send a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all protection systems and the secret location. Sending people to the secret spore does not make them a secret anymore. Sending people to disable all protection systems makes it possible for spores to be easily released into the air. How about leaving the dogs sleeping? <br /> <br /> A pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As the unimpeded macho team members withdraw with a mechanically predictable time, engaging Vivian Wu's charm makes the idea of ​​the plot of his old employer so desirable. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! Vivian Wu's fans may want to check a remarkable B movie he's got a few years ago called DINNER TE GRABESTI. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
