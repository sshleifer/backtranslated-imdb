One of Frances Farmer's oldest films; at 22, is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in the voice, but the songs are not the best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, perhaps great in its time, is really corny today. Roy Rogers also appears in a singing role. In my opinion, you just have to look at yourself if you are a fan of Frances Farmer and perhaps a fan of Bing Crosby.
