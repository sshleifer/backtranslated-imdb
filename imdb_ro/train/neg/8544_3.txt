I have never been sure where this is going. These people seem to be interested in what's happening on a mountain. They investigate, have narrow leaks, go, come back, leave, put themselves in danger, get sick, attack witches who have solid cabinets, etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but she leaves it for a number of times . She is taken, takes her back, leaves her again. You got it. Everything seems to come to some sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure or turning people into a witch, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endless and it's not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the footprint is so bad that there are no unusual twenty seconds of black. It is caused by age or excessive use of night filters.
