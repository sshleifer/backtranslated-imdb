I saw this movie on the mystery theater when it was called "Live at night." This title is much less misleading than "Batpeople." In fact, it would be better called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats, I think because he wants to do better treatment for rabies. This is not clear. What is clear is that he and his wife make a tour of a cave and he is bitten by a bat. Why a scientist has to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. He should not be able to enter alone. Well, after being bitten he and his wife go to the honeymoon, where it starts to fit. They go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. Eventually, the man kills 3-4 people, and his wife sits beside him, and you should roots him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
