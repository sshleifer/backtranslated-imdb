I read reviews of this movie and generally were pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a great fan of francofriend and art, but I think this is still a case in which critics do something "artistic" or "intellectual" in something that is not. I will be tough: it contains scenes of sexual perversion that I never wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems, but I did not want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is, in essence, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a dream, I was rejected by the last scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was not close to the disgust and rejection I felt during this film.
