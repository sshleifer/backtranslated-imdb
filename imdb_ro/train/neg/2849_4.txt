A comparison of this film with "The Last Detail" is done by some, but "Chasers" is flatter than a string of interstate motorways in western Texas. And, like the desert landscape, there is nothing to note, not even the fact that a female prisoner is carried by two escorts of this brand. No one in the cast decides too well; with this blade script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give too much space to this if he ever writes a memo, I do not think.
