I understand this movie was made on a very low budget, but it is not an excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, Fire Throne, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Barbarian Invincible were made on budgets and some weak special effects, yet they managed to create classics of worship, adding some women warriors dressed repeatedly and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscapes gave Grendel the potential of being a great budget sword and witchcraft, but the producers have completely ruined this opportunity by using the extremely low CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie to Beowulf (1999). Perhaps it's not Citizen Kane, but it's a good example of how to make a low-budget SF / Adventure movie, using credible special effects and appealing characters.
