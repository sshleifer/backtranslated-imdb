My wife and I like to rent awesome / sci-fi movies and watch them with friends for laughing. I saw it on plinmoondirect.com and we decided to add it to our netflix list. Now when I say the movie is terrible, I mean well. Everything about this, the role of actor, camera, story, costume, is so noisy and low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors showed that it would have gone right. I really hope that who did this movie was not serious when they did it because if it were, then it would be just sad. If you enjoy watching terrible horror movies just to have fun, then I recommend this.
