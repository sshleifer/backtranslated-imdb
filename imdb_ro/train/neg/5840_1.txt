All right, then. I've just watched a load of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not too sure about which I wanted to revise first. Then he hit me like a rat: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity does not see anyone and it is boring to sit down. And it's about mutant rats that kill people. Yes ... really scary "original" The Foods of the Gods "or" Willard "whoever? They were better than that, and that does not say much ... POSSIBLE SPOILER ** Well, here's the story: the Inna lab, the man his scientist and his assistant plucky, experimented on rats and their lab is in a lively neighborhood and a rigid building, and the moronic friends of the floating assistant are showing drunk and everyone gets food for mad rats and almost all die and, yes, there is a huge rat that looks miserable, but it's killed, there, all in a sentence once! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I want to contradict you! The second we all realized there was a rat giant, we all know it will eventually die !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> - Well, I watched him for free, but for all the others ... hmmm, no, there's nothing good here. <br /> <br /> I did not hurt him, I did not help: <br /> <br /> - Uh ... okay. gore was decent. - Very medium cinema. <br /> <br /> - Rats are not as bad as they could have been in some photos ... <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> In other photos, CG rats were quite inexpensive. Look, if your movie has a low budget, maybe you should not rely on CG. Lesson to Heart. <br /> <br /> - The actor is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - It was done before - many times. <br /> <br /> - A great, stupid story. - The giant rat looks like a fat man in poorly designed bear costume - it was kind of funny - but not fun enough to give this movie the value. <br /> <br /> - Dialogue resumed, unrealistic and boring. <br /> <br /> - All schoolchildren at school tequila drinks from huge plastic milk cups - and yet they do not seem to be drinking for more than a few seconds. How to stay with continuity, boys. Ugly: This movie is bad. Simply terrible. Worse than you would imagine. It's not even bad like, for example, "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead". Now those movies are the crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you great. Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Closed action blade film, complete with unbeaten heroes and explosion. Because he did not feel like the rest of this monstrosity - but still sucked. Action: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (Tempting Your Son Occasionally During movie, so I probably missed it, but it is supposed to be there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialog: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average for time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you like horror movies from rats and parasites. Wait ... Check this out. You do not look at him. It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
