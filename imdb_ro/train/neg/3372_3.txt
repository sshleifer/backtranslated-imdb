A pale shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that director Richard Attenborough completely loses the musical point, uselessly "opens" him and fools the force of the play. The show is about a group of dancers doing a job audition in a B'way musical and examining their own will and desire to work in this demanding line of work and not always satisfying. Attenborough gives us a new expression of hope, assuming he's trying to get a "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the gritty mix of characters created on stage like a "Gypsy" workgroup, along with a few newcomers. The movie has an edge over the play and this is the opening scene, showing the original audience size and real contraction scale up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, which is badly kept on the line in the movie) . Anyone who can catch a local production of the luminous work of the play will have a much richer experience than to see this badly designed film.
