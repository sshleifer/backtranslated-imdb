"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It's a movie loved by mothers, grandparents and locks who go to movies every five years. As a zombie film, it blows. There is no corpse to face and is very weak in the gore department. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is big on corpses and quite generous with bloodshed - so it's better than "Gone With The Wind". It is also not overestimated. Most commentators are not at all confused with the fact that it is a garbage. However, it is not a boring trash. After a terrorist steals a virus, he leaves it while he is being followed by a helicopter, and chemicals are leaking to the ground. The terrorist, who was exposed to an ugly mix, is hiding in a hotel room where he slowly turns into a meat-eating zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. Once it was bitten, the mark of Lucio Fulci's hell marks itself. As usual, for a Fulci film, the action is atrocious, the story is full of plot holes, and the gore is abundant. It seems that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei to explain his rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, too badly edited, and the sound design is flat. Yet she is rescued by her joyful admiration at the most amazing of the murders and her impatient rhythm. It is certainly worth listening if you are the worst. Or does not like "Gone With The Wind", no doubt the worst zombie movie ever.
