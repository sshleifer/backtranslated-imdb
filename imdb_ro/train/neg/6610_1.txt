This movie should not be seen because it should have been a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to do this remake of the classic Bollywood movie "Sholay", but after he had problems with the original producers he decided to go ahead with the project and ... to find all the good parts of the movie (action, script , songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and film the movie just because it is already going to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he fired a Coppola (Nose); What did you think of the RGV? However, the story is, though hard to follow, almost as similar to the old school. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, the new kid in the Ajay block (Jay, sholay). Both bad and fun friends help a cop catch a bad guy first. Later in the film, now the retired policeman hires them as personal security and the safeguarding of the very desired Bubban by Amitabh Bachan. If you have not seen Bollywood movies, good boys will eventually win. That's where I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
