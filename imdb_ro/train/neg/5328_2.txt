Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top credits under the belt. I'm sure she's glad she came back from the movie that seems to have admirers. I'm not one of them. I've seen a better adventure in high school than in Smithereens. In a plot like young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to do it in the music world, he is willing to do something to get there. It even rejects the sincere progress of a young artist who lives on his eastern river van, played by Brad Rijn. The young Mr. Rijn contributes with the slightest performance in the film, in fact one of the worst jobs I've seen for a long time. No wonder he did not go anywhere. I'll say Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar places in East Village where the movie was shot the most. But her work with her living artists has not changed. I'm not sure he had that much raw material to work with. Look fast and you will see a very young Christopher Noth before the Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can stand by it for the soundtrack. I'm staying at Bing Crosby.
