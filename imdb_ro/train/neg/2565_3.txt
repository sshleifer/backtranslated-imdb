There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. First, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed in just five or maybe ten. The whole movie is already short, but this could have been done by paying more attention to Leo Mean (as he missed a reference to "The Wiz" on that one) and working subplot or a little more closely in the main plot. In short, the script had a good idea, but it needed a lot of work. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it could have been done without gross humor. The original had some that he could have done without, but at least there was almost a later idea - here abundance and urination abound. Third, the show is too self-conscious. The original series was pretty good, just like the first movie, but here's just way, too much. Brendan Fraser's in-jokes were just a little over the top (and why no mention of "the new Ursula"?). Other Narrator gangs, especially some pairs of close-end interactions, also outperform common sense. Fourthly, a little more attention could be paid to CGI's work. At first it was hard to say that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out as a big finger. Ideally, special effects should only tell the story if they are good or bad, and at least they manage to matter, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. All he said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is pretty decent. He is deprived of the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher only fails in a comparison - he even managed to give George a personal depth that should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie , but it was not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original. Most other performances were quite standard, not standing in my mind as good or bad.
