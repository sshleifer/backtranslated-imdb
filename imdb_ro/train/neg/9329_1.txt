One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money from Hollywood Video?" This is in no way worth four dollars, or any dollar. I think it was an attempt to destroy Mexican or Vin Diesel movies, but it did not do this miserable. The acting was terrible, I'm sorry for the actors they could not find any better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. I turned to the lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The lady's foremost Mexican accent was an exaggerated insult, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Jump over him.
