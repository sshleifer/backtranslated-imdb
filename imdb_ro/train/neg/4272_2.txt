These types of movies where a psychopath from a variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually completely eliminate) a naive person to take over his life. The fatal attraction, Pacific Heights, The Swinging Hand, The Only White Woman and a Thousand of Movies Made For Television Are Some Examples. But while a few, especially Fatal and Heights Attractions in the Pacific could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspicious or some plot overturning, the Illegal Entrance plays everything through the book. And if it's not his star's notoriety (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film will sink to mediocrity sooner than a miniseries Danielle Steele. Russel interprets Michael Carr as a naive guy who calls for help from a pair of officers when someone comes in and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly rejects his fury of feeling so helpless in the situation of the wrong policeman (Ray Liotta), a typical psychophobic bastard with no limits to his power. At the first empathy with Carr (probably just by pretending to do so), the cops are friends with the couple. But soon enough, the cops will take Carr away, destroying the boys' lives in almost any way (which is quite easy when you are a cop and when you are the police officer who installed the type of home security system) to take over and probably to get her wife. It seems to be less goal-oriented, and more like the policeman just wants to prove his strength. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words than a purpose. And the story is played entirely by the book, you can probably predict each occurrence before it happens on the screen if you have seen enough of these movies. From the shocking moment, the naive, main character realizes that he is a victim of credit card fraud (committed by the psychotic villain) at the end of his life, which is not really dead.
