The truth is that a film based on Harold Robbins' novel will not win prizes. There is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B picture in budget, distribution and execution. From a technical point of view, it resembles a movie made for television. The act is very uneven. Joseph Cali is particularly terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As a Katherine Hepburn commentator said about a certain performance, her range goes from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and scattered in her roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserve better. However, everything can be very fun in a strange way. Robbins, as is appropriate, is all about sex and nudity. If you want to have fun ... and you're not too sober ... that could be for you.
