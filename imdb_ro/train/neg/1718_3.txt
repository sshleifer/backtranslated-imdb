I've read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, where her costumes and locations echo the actual strip photos. Especially well done is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photos taken on that day by Blanche's affliction on her dying husband. However, this film is still Hollywood, and our heroes are still pretty good to the end, even after they were shot with holes (alive, Bonnie was burned in a car accident a year before their famous ambush, a perishable cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is boring and the acting is weak, especially those that lead. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. It may not be the "true story," but it's a great movie.
