Big West I hear you all saying! First brilliant effort! Well, I'm not sure what movie you've been watching, but it must have been different from the one I've seen. The great westerns or, indeed, good movies of any kind have characters you can believe in and this movie did not have any! The actor was the poorest and at least he did not care about any of the characters, making this movie useless. the story was too big for decision-makers and you should probably try their hand to make direct TV to low-budget garbage as you see on these science-fiction programs "FACT or FICTION". look for a good movie, a great western or even a pleasant half hour, please look elsewhere.
