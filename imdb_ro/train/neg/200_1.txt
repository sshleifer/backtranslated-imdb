Reviews that I liked this movie surprise me. Land is a mess. Characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the movie spying on the other characters and mistakenly judging all. No one has a quality of redemption or a point of interest. This is not a shattered work. It's not imaginative. It's not ironic. He is not intelligent. There is nothing directly in this boring work. That's the lack of the theatrical release is no surprise. That "this network" is broadcasting this location. I definitely recommend returning to a resumption of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even good information if you met this mess in late night TV. If you meet her during the day of television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better that you have not suffered through this. Life is short. This movie is long.
