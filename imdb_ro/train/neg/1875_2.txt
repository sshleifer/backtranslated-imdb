First of all, I really liked Henry Fool, which puts me in a very small pizzeria of movies. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But the movie was a full transvestity. Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the movie in the excerpt - so proud of it, and making unnecessary analogies to Star Wars - has returned to the stomach. This was a top-notch (HDNET) maker's hype. A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Mostly I feel that Hal has spoiled forever HENRY FOOL. I do not think I'll see again in pure, innocent light. Remember Hal, you can bother some of them early ... The director would not be anywhere today if all he did was get the garbage out of the way. Unfortunately, it is a pure example of the lesson learned in ADAPTATION. The story must be interesting and active, or her hopes in the box office are really weak. It does not matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to act in a jacket. The score, I think Hartley's, is tasteless. With drum strokes that go through the dialogue. There's only one Apple Soundtrack music loop I admitted to giving me a smile. When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they just try to catch a new audience. But it really is this ridiculous walk. I'd be happy to destroy this movie for you, but it's over. It's rotten. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
