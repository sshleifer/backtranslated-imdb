I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screenplay of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps strangely around (since then I found out that the film is missing a section), and the characters appear and disappear with an irritating suddenness. Some interludes are too explicative (for example, "why are you not a child anymore?" - reduced to the picture for a long and slow beating - "you are a woman!" Yes, we got it first), but there are some sequences speech that calls for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and the argument of his blonde friend, please!) Complot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically), was disturbing to the point where it was hard to look. For the writer's credit, this problem has been treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the correct and good inevitability of Mary Pickford movies (for example, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney offers good performance as usual, but I think he was better directed in the past - he has done it several times here, IMHO. I liked the clown sequences and I was very impressed with the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though amazingly young. The film has its moments, but so far it's Chaney's least favorite image.
