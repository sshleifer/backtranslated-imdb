To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there should be some facts and realism. 1. We never know why these people think so. 2. The location is New Year's Eve in Toronto Canada. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REMEMBER TO MIDNIGHT AND WHY (based on costumes) YOU WANT YOU READ SEPTEMBER 3. The actress was in that neo-naturally style that needed a director to know how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. Individual pieces of stories were all disturbing and without a purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to do that boring like the movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on the IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thank you I am as always JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSMAN
