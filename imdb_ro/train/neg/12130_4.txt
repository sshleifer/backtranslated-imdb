The Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci. Now, with this great talent mix, you think this movie would have been a true gore festival. This can not be further than that. The massacre falls on his face, being one of the most boring slasher films I've ever seen coming from Italian cinema. Actually, I was struggling to stay awake during the movie and I never had this problem with Italian horror movies. The massacre begins with a prostitute who is slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used in Fulci's nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and it raises the film's expectations as an ax that acts for slaughter. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie is so dull. The film is heading for a set of horror film that is filmed and there is a lot of evolution of character during all these scenes, but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acting that your interest starts to disappear. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not that bad, but it could have been much better. The film's gore was pathetic and since Fulci used most gore scenes in the Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the film has left a beautiful breath, but it remains still largely unanswered and continuity falls directly through the floor. It was not a very good film, but for a truly horrible Italian horror (like me) this film is a must have, because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
