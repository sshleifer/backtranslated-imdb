I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and I was fascinated by it. then I immediately took the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw him back in 98, I liked it somehow. well, now I looked at it again in full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how bad it was said: When they enter Lhasa, people begin to grasp their tongues in the mouth, and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that it is the way to salute in Tibet, so they salute back ... in Harrer's book, sticking tongue is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and can do so in front of the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama himself wearing glasses in public. In the Harrer book he mentions that no one in Tibet was wearing glasses at the time (I'm sorry he forgot the reason, but he also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did it, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what do you think Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young Buddha alive? childhood ... and Tibetan clothing Harrer and Aufschnaiter tailored to fashion, not European designer costumes! why are so many events that really happened in the story just to fill the time with a fictitious love interest (the female tailor ...) that is completely inalienable? like the whole story about son harrers, role. no word is mentioned about him or even about any member of the Harrer family in the book. but that was OK for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about the person harrers. about Tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet that heinrich harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for cinema.
