this is the only movie I've ever left. bad action - bad plot - bad casting - bad targeting - bad cinema - if he wanted to make a bad picture he could not have done a better job. I hope they're proud of his turkey. I'm surprised that someone associated with this movie has ever been hired again at Hollywood. Do not waste time!
