It seemed to me that I had bought one of those legacy of horror film collections 50 and you think I still look through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find a nice plate, such as The Devil Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's great movies (some are not terrible and they're just there because Hitchcock has directed some horrors and suspense), but once they seem to have put movies like The Island Monster and that's because I can not accept that it would be easy forgotten and it should be for that. So we're opening up to a Westing game idea. The rich but cruel and abusive father, played by Carradine (one of the present features), died and left her children and servants still hated. Carradine offers performance as good as ever, but he has gone mainly into a voice recording and flashback sequence that lets us sit through mediocre / terrible shows. The rest of the cast is either overstated or staged. Since it was an independent film of the 70s, lighting and effects are quite limited. It's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can not see what's going on in some scenes. Some actors such as Igor and Elga serve at least one effort, and I am ashamed to admit that they let me torture myself mainly for pure nonsense, but still, with very little happiness, they fired a version of overturning quite obviously who did it, but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. You are not allowed to enjoy the characters, whether they are selfish and crude or psychotic, but it leads to a whole new level and makes many undiscovered. Scenes of death are pretty bad and suspense is not right there. It turns out that you will probably enjoy the movie of 20 films "Chilling" that contains films such as Haunted Hill House, Little Shop of Horror's with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead over it. This is best avoided.
