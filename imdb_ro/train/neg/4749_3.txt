This movie was so badly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. Banknotes in the film are horns, and although the intrigue is interesting at certain angles, too much attention and, at times, ridiculous. If you are 11 years old or more, you will overlook the writing of the film and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger, this is a movie that will capture your attention and be amazed by all the stunts to add them are badly made) and want to be a warrior. Filming in this movie was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like trying to build up the tension but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible), the action in this movie is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this type of movie, in some of the more serious, ridiculous scenes. When he did some of his "fighting" positions, I started laughing loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is certainly the direction, for example, the part where his enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain possesses, as her voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly bad and how Wendy's instructors (Brenda Song) were all school teachers, being possessed by monks, which was ridiculous. So to surmount everything, a disappointing film, but good if you are 10 or less.
