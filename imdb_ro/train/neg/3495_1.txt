I watched an episode. Yeah, I've been through all the miserable experience and I have to say that this comic book is one of the worst you get. Imagine Peter Griffin, the Guy family. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (certainly thin and minus the glasses), except that he now lacks something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know he's an idiot. Sarah has no authentic character, none of the abilities that act to get her character off. Perhaps her tribal banknotes, forms that make comedies even smaller than her character, can do it alone. Perhaps there is a lack of credible foliage. Her insensitive person, bigoted, can appeal to insensitive, bigoted people, as opposed to the massive appeal of Stephen Colbert's insensitive, bigoted character. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying and unpleasant character. It lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, not to mention the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman does not have, remarkable. And when you do not believe or identify yourself, it's no longer funny.
