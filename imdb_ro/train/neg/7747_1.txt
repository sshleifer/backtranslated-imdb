Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like the old B films, should warn you about the quality of this film. This is, however, not a movie B. It's a D movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals - WOW - is the worst data animation ever made over the past two decades. <br /> <br /> Never see the SCAAARY templates displayed on the front cover. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and sometimes seeing a teeth or a tiger paw. He's so amateur! It may be worth seeing, just because it's so bad. Give a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen and I'm waiting for their reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is weak to give a warning Spoiler! This is a spiller.
