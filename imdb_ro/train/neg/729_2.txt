Before I started seeing the show, I heard it was great and aesthetic very interesting. What a scam, the scriptures are so bad that I'm sure the authors are son and nephew of Scoobidoo writers. And what about the SFX and the colors are so extreme that it is painful to look, the colors are not saturated, they are too saturated, the scriptures are overwritten and show that it is overestimated. This show is like an unpleasant pie in which a baby would just put sugar and butter thinking that, because these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two components of this show are, in the end, the emptiness and total lack of credibility.
