Andy Lau plays the role of another undercover cop. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for police and is also close to the top of a drug gang (Lau). The movie starts as we see the police trying to make a drug bust just to see how it goes in pieces. Then I was presented to the young drug addict and her daughter who lived near Nick, his friends and policemen, and in 45 minutes I closed the movie and put the news. Well, act and wonder to look at this is like we did not have a movie as we have seen for a long time. It's not as bad as that, you really do not care. I mean, I did not care. Actually, I started doing something else completely forgetting that I had a subtitled movie, so I did not care. I would have liked to have hated the movie, but the movie is so steadfast that it made no impression (I could not even sleep with something to ignore it). Come on the tape called Scarface Chinese, after he died? This is one to avoid.
