People at Disney have a lot to explain. First, why does anyone think this sitcom material would ever make an honest film. In the Kooky 60 teleplay, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us had not yet been given the sophisticated treatment of the X Files. Strange visions of the little green men have long been destroyed by ETs, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and Aliens 1-3. Every charm of the property was mainly due to the relationship of hope created between the late Bixby Bill as Tim and Ray Walston as a foreign visitor. I thought the Martians had the antenna seemed sweet then. Now it seems to be positively idiot. However, Christopher Lloyd's uncle deals with the metallic appendages. In an early blow, the antenna on a sign for the television station Tim is working on should make us think of "Martian"! When you last saw a rabbit ears, did not you? Disney does not trust strange relationships or relationships and embellishes this movement with special effects for young people, including a talking room suit called Zoot! Yes, you read correctly - Uncle Martin's silver suit speaks. It should be a real hilarious cut! Figure again. I have stretched socks that are more fun than Zoot. Whenever action is latent (and is constantly delayed), computer graphics are put into play to increase things. Tim is here played by kindly Jeff Daniels, who can not (or will not) do anything to save this scary mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings a comic zeal to her neighboring lady. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully drawn in procedures - all without result. This foreign visitor is dead on arrival. The constant discussion of sitcoms returning to the screen makes me hope that the movie "I DREAM OF JEANNIE" will not contain a harem speaking. I pray that Samantha's cat in BEWITCHED has no lines. I live in fear that I love LUCY - The film will proudly present a CG Conga Drum called Bongo. Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - Take me to your leader.
