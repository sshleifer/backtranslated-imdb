Not that I do not like kids movies, but that was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities. MJ Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart, and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly amusing, but he does not have a chance in this movie. It is sugar-coated sugar and could not appeal to people over the age of seven. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
