I grew up on Scooby Doo Where are you and I still love. It's one of my favorite drawings along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect like Scooby and Shaggy), the theme song is tolerable and has a pleasant animation. However, it is quite disappointing. Normally, I do not mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be the main character, he gets annoying quickly. Complete with Power Puppy Power, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. Also, half of the band is missing after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were generally blade and non-original, very few monsters who followed or exposed the evil. Overall, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get an idea, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, voices, theme song and the fact that it's beautiful for kids. Bethany Cox
