The film has about two stories: one is a political crime of a girl, the other one a first-class political party. The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino, being the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening. If the script is terrible, with no decent dialogues and free any sense of drama, Al's performance is memorable: how many people can be as convincing as a strong and fearful man (like the "Godfather"), as here as a little servant see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become an old one tired. This passage of the ages moves a lot, because it makes the audience think of aging. But his slowing is just a makeup because he can recover his energy in the church scene. > <br /> Maybe it's a good thing the movie is so terrible because it put the light of the stars on Al's talent!
