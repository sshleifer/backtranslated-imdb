This was a silly movie with a predictable story and a terrible action! Willy Nelson was as rigid as his clothing. The film looked like a long notice for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore - especially because there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not funny and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Any money spent to make this movie was a shameful waste. Any other hints on Marilyn Monroe's old movies have not improved the Blonde Ambition view at all. It was also so incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to get executive secretary at the drop of a hat - which was ridiculous!
