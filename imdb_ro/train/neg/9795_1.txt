Come on, what about this show, Power Rangers anyway? I have always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and excuses in the history of toy marketing! There is absolutely no point with this show. bad luck, earrings, etc all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to "duhs" from the main distributor, Jason, Trini , Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: Give me a break! Saban brought this from Japan, then Disney bought the rights to this show five years ago. Now the audience has to endure the restart of this show on Disney Channel and others. All I can say once again gives me a break!
