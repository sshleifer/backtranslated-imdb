A mess of chocolate, which appears as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull champion who leaves the rodeo for a home stay on the desert of his Arizona people, where government suits have just invested in the family cattle flock (who needs a shaft). What director Peter Tewksbury needs some narrative skills, however, what he lacks in the evaluation he compensates in comic fixes (his social commentary is not exactly underlined, but Tewksbury has a satirical inclination to his glow and there are some scenes funny). Despite the colorful transformations of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general turmoil is getting bigger and there are too many Hoopes and Hollerin to support a great deal of interest. As for Elvis, he is free and frisky along - and while it's nice to see him have fun on the screen, we have to ask if he has just given up at the moment. This shameful image has a distinct clue that gives it a whisper, and although the spirits are high, the yields are largely low. * 1/2 from ****
