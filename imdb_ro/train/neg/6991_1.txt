Just do not bother. I thought I'd see a movie with great obedience and action. But it becomes boring and terribly predictable after the exciting beginning. In the middle of the movie, you have a little social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down. The end of it gets better, but not really great. I think the director made this film too serious. In such a movie, even if you do not care about the plot, you even want a beautiful action. I almost stopped in the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br />
