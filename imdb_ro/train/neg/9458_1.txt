There are a lot of comments already posted, saying exactly how I felt about this movie so bad to shorten it. "Grinch" I thought it was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physically comic, as well as being a versatile intelligent actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, makes his laugh annoying. I love it very much in his days "Waynes World" and "So I married an Axan assassin," but I was never in love with Austin Powers and "Cat In The Hat" just finished. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible - the throats were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but also in the fact that some of them were so dazzled that they did not amuse anyone for 50 years! The land was dirty, dirty, dirty! It is a shame because the children were very pleased, as was the "mother". Perhaps he could have picked a better bastard than Alec Baldwin - but could he have shot him if it was not for Myers, ugly, revolting, even a look at a script? Has one been written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be wings! On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and the hints were wonderful! But, unfortunately, I can not save this movie. Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius! Do not destroy your reputation by adapting your work in such a lazy and disordered way!
