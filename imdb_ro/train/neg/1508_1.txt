I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in the chair. I think we just waited for a movie with Gere to have some value in it in the end, but nothing of value ever came to the screen. The story is a bad excuse to gather after a slaughter and torture. There is no character in the movie that does anything like real life. Cutting style is based on jump cuts, thumbnails, and overlays to give weight to this vapid configuration by a sadistic band that has been running out for years and that SURPRISE leader is the "victim" of an executed killer. I do not see Gere, a Buddhist, involved in this violent, sexist garbage.
