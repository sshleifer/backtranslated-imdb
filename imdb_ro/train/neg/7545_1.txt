It is regrettable that you can not walk less than one star. Before watching The Wicker Man, I thought Aliens 3 was the only movie that would actually deserve negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not have the joy of a previous movie, but it remains that my joy of cumulated film has been reduced by seeing. There is a cheap trick often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good or too fast writers to allow it to make a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: it slames in a shock and ends and hopes the public will make mistakes for something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds, and in this case only manages to squeeze the embarrassment of a fine actor and ridicule the producers. Even more so, by the fact that the conclusion "carefully arranged" (or whatever they put it) does not seem to follow logically from the plot (which, of course, they can not elaborate without introducing spoilers), and instead deny what it deserves up to that moment. It's a movie that could make a logical appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles and eventually Nicholas Cage's fans, but only to some of the mainstream audience. If you really want something in these directions, I seriously recommend The Village in exchange for M. Night Shyamalan. If I do not have a memory eraser, I think I have to look to something better to force it from my mind, say, Attack of killer tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
