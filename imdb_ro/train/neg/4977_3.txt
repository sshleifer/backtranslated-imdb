This is a rather unnecessary television film, telling Beowulf's story, especially after the recent Beowulf and Grendel movie in 2005. This film does not really fit into Beowulf's story, it just takes us through its battle against the beast mischievous, known as Grendel, because it leaves a kingdom in fear and absolute disorder while the powerful Viking warrior, Beowulf is called to escape the monster. If this is done successfully, the King will no longer have to sacrifice his children to keep him back. After some failed attempts, the creature is killed, but the angry and revenge mother soon attacks, leaving Beowulf to re-divide his powerful acts of courage and power to defeat her. "Grendel" seems to be shot on a small budget and the effects of CG are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely useless.
