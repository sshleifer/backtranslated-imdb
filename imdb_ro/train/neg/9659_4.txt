After watching this movie, I was frankly disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the director - I was disappointed with these movie ads. Trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third way" other than surrender or die (the Polish information was even wrong that they had a choice between being killed by their own artillery or German weapons, even translated the title wrong as "missed battalion"). This guessed the right place and I bought the movie. The disappointment began when I realized that the third way is to sit down and count the dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting the corpses ... Then I started to think, "hey, this story can not be that simple. I bet this intelligent officer will find a cunning way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, she did not, they just stood there waiting for something to happen. And so it was me. The story was based on real World War I events, so writers could not use too much imagination, but I even thought I found this film really unconvincing and even a bit boring. And as I first wrote - it's not the fault of the actors, the writers or the director - their marketing people have raised my expectations far beyond the level with which they could cope with this film.
