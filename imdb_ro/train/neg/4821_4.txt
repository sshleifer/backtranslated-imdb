The fiction film (which he writes as a story, though he has a "documented" credit) about a group of scientists who go into the wild of Canada to try to find a Bigfoot. (They want to capture one and then attach a tracking device). His many mumbo-styled styles mingle into what is really a boring film of a group of people walking in the wilderness. There are some attempts to create tension and scare, but to be perfectly honest, there is nothing to be noticed here except some wonderful wild pictures. This is a perfect definition of a exploitative film, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it offers very little. Recommended only for insomnia
