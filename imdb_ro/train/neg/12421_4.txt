Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" in 1987 is an extremely gross comedy in many parts, but occasionally very funny. This movie could have definitely been a lot better, the action is terrible, and some extremely skewed scenes make it harder for me to watch, but the concept is fun and has some funny moments. in the near future (1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John McCafferty) hosts a "Live Or Die" game where prisoners sentenced to death have the chance to play for their lives and for money. Candidates who fail, run in the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other bizarre execution devices, followed by applause from the applause studio audience. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made a lot of enemies ... "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many respects, and the act is terrible but is undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it is certainly fun and good time. 4/10
