After a day at work, I sat down to relax and started the movie channels. The movie appeared on the guide and sounded interesting, so I set it right before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of ability to play Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot made me get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit that should be given to act in this film, it should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. Overall, she does not intend to impress your friends, choosing her as a tenant for a movie night.
