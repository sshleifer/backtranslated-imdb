The movie is actually too slow. There are some beautiful pictures, but it can not go beyond the fact that the movie is actually boring. You see sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual act while you eat a melon and maybe a little more. It might sound really interesting to someone, but believe me to watch her for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh many times, but it really is not enough and maybe it is more desperate and unbelievable than fun. To bother the director of boredom try to put some videos in the movie. There are very colorful clips of absurd melodies, maybe in the 50s, but it's hard to say exactly and try to be so funny that it's very sad. Sometimes you have the feeling that this plot can evolve into something, that a powerful scene is created, but at the end it evaporates and somehow evaporates. Apart from videos, there is almost no dialogue or music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. I personally can not recommend the movie. I think art is something that should not be boring. During the projection, he was yawning around the cinema, which confirms the brief review.
