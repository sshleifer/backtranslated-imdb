I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The best thing about the film is that in some parts you think a little about the spiritual subject, your evolution, your synchronicity and your role in the world. However, the immersion of the film is easy to break and there is a very small ratio between the spectator and the characters. It is very clear that this book is losing much in this movie version. Events that should have shown that synchronicity is occurring are almost unrecognizable. A multitude of reasoning must be done for the spectator to see that the scene indicates a coincidence and even more to imagine that it is related to a greater purpose. <br /> <br /> Enlightenment scenes are visually weak and do not create the better feeling they should have. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in the Little Buddha)? Well, there's nothing like that. Most scenes are badly executed. There are lots of scenes that do not develop the story and also do not help create an atmosphere. The best actors in this film, Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not Save it. The first 2 seem to have had more scenes than their characters should try to save the movie and because they have been paid more, but that does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells like a bad guy (as usual), but the script does not help him all. The scene in which he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad screenplay. The execution of the scene when it dies in an explosion is performed absurdly. Flashbacks in the movie can never be commented. Overall, this movie is a great time, read the book! I did not read it, but it's probably a billion times better than that, it must be. It's so bad I had to write the first comment in IMDb.
