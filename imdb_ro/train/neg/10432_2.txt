Terrible termination - and I can not believe Moore spent a year with her. The smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed in just three weeks. This was quite disappointing for me to throw my records for the first 3.5 years. Now, the first 1.5 hours were full of action, though absurd in the premise, and then deteriorated in a slow, painful, sophomoric dissolution of the series. Incredibly, how slow and attractive it was for the last time. Would we think more deeply? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would have recited Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Absurd to believe that the 38 people would give up everything for a "fresh start". Absurd to throw a missing Kara and Baltar and six reappear. Absurd to throw in mitochondrial morning. Just absurd.
