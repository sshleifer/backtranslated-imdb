Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find her way to the official list of DPP Video Nasty (Devil Hunter, Luna Bloody and Women Behind the Bars), this is perhaps the least deserved of notoriety, being a great jungle madness animated. , a useless scandal, a free rape scene and a lot of nudity. The blonde superstar Ursula Buchfellner plays Laura Crawford, a star of a racist kidnapping and taking on a remote tropical island, a wild tribe worshiping the "devil god" hiding in the jungle (a big, empty, with clogged eyes, who likes to eat the hearts of the feminine sacrifices). a $ 6 million redemption, courageous mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnamese pilot Vietnamese pilot travel to the island, but they have problems when bad boys try a double cross. During confusion, Laura escapes into the jungle, but goes straight into the arms of the natives of the island who offer their god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs in his usual and tortious style and loads this ridiculous effort with his terrible common brands: carp gore, dirty cinema, fast zooms, numerous footage, focusing images, sound effects terrible and editing in ham. The result is a terrible mess that is a real fight to get from start to finish (took me a pair of meetings to finish things), and even Buchfellner's view in all her natural glory is not enough to me it makes me come back in a hurry.
