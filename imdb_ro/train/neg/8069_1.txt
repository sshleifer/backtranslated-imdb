An incoherent mess with a deafening sound track, "Soul Survivors," is the latest entry in "Who's Dead and Who's Alive" like horror movies. Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to different colleges, but before they break up to the Thanksgiving break, they are going to the rave party for a last time in a burnt church to the suggestion of luxury slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, alias Faith, the other vampire). Scary reasons do not start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and the quartet before leaving the party. Remove into their SUV, they are watched and then passed by the scary boys who, promptly and inexplicably, make an intention 180 in the middle of the highway, causing an ugly and fatal accident, the SUV throwing over a dike and throwing it in bad. Sean is killed (or is it?) And Cassie spends the rest of the film to the loneliness and vice (driving), it is not haunted by the ghost of Sean or tortured by those poor boys. An inexplicable incoherence is due to the fact that Cassie's mental state continues to degenerate until we reach the foreseeable conclusion. So who is dead and who is alive? Ninety minutes after this purgatory, who really cares?
