I hired the Hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! A bad attempt at a tele-film. The guy they received for leadership was totally weak and when he ran (he did a lot) seemed to eat those minted sweets ... with his back! The contact fights they wore were great, though I feel that the actor relies too much on them because there is nothing threatening about his actors. The wise American Indian chicken must be one of the most difficult stones to see. Talk about a cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I think it's because he did sex. The sex scene was greedy. They can also show curtains if you can fill this up. Finally, and this is a big hate for pets, on the cover and DVD menu, the losers have digitally pulled the cold sharpened teeth of the type. There was no place to be seen in the movie. :(
