With all the disrespect for George Stevens Sr. "epic" of miscastings and wrong mistakes, I can only wonder that the legend "James Dean" could survive this exit, say then the studio enjoys "giants" collecting its own "gigantism". Not even Rock and Liz were much better. Let's just say that "Dallas" was the authentic "heir", even if in the last days "Texans" such as Lay and DELay, not to mention the alleged "president" of these Amurric states. a chance of global dimensions. I have never read Edna Ferber's original, but will put the odds that the head and shoulders are superior to those on the screen. And all the well paid, I would imagine, "supporting" celebrities and celebrities, despite, "Giant" is, for me at least, a foot of low merit, it does not bother promotional campaigns.
