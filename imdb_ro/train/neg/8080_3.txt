I had great hopes for this movie because it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes collapsed on the ground in the first 20 minutes or so. The palace was ridiculous. Not even the beauty of Heston or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or naked short scenes) could save this film. Some of the space effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should ignore this. Grade F
