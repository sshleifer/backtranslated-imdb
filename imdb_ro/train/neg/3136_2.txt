There are a lot of obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's face, however, the main reasons why someone would think it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they are not good actors, they say they were embarrassed in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I say the filmmakers did a good job making the ship pleasant to the eye), but it even has some major flaws. For example, just before the ship goes under it, you can see an unfinished image on the blue screen behind your main characters. Do not get me wrong, I love the story REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to this story. The editing was atrocious - there is no reason why a movie should be over 2 1/2 hours (except MAYBE Biographical), and writing and scripting were terrible. that music was maybe better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is a scene that comes out when the ship sinks and the bass sounds bass. This could well be the climax of the movie. As for the mood, it was extremely dull. I was more relaxed than sad when Jack died, which I know can not be what the director intended. In a shell of nuts, it seems terrible to me that they have transformed the beautiful story of the Titanic into hip-hop.
