Kol, a prisoner of space on the space-dead line, manages to hijack a space shuttle and flee to the American forest, where, along with a new friend found, tries to escape the cyborg killing machine Alienator. Fred Olen Ray's best film career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers," this can only help to feel like a little letdown. Just as budgetly as the previous movie, but not as fun as me. None of the actors talked to me. The movie is fine for the non-discriminatory viewer during a rainy afternoon rain, but that's pretty good for me. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> Where I Watched: Thriller Showtime
