This is a movie about cruelty to animals. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see representations of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a dead horse in SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this has his consciousness spiritually cleansed by the flames of the burial / burning of the horse, which, of course, is still dead, being tortured to death. This is one of the sickest and weakest movies I've ever had the discontent of watching. While Gene Hackman and James Coburn are approaching the arrival line of the DYING animals, we have to admire their spirit for finishing the race. I would like to put the producers and the director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they'll end, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
