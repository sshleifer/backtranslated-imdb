The film is blocking an important point: the fact that this killer was also a responsible, loving and caregiving father. Not that the impossibility of being a father and a murderer. But this man is shown killing a teenager without challenges or motives and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think a father who cared so much about his daughter could have been so cold with someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, it could have been so cold that they worried and cared for their own daughter. And the idea that a condemned killer would actually ask the victim's parents to take him and take care of his daughter is not convinced. That being said, the characters were acting with conviction by the actors. I thought the change in Scott Bakula's eyes made him look colder and more threatening than usual. You could not see him in his eyes at all.
