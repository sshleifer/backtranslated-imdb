this movie has many disadvantages and that's all I could see. it is painfully long and bold. I could see the whole audience becoming impatient and waiting for it to end. Running time is over 3 hours, which could have been edited in less than 2 hours. The transition between stories is medium. most people have confessed that they are on the seats waiting for something better to get out. His amusement is only in his pockets. ambitious project and an execution under par. govinda makes a loyal job, anil kapoor disappointed me, we rested as expected. if u expect something close to babel or love actually, then it is not where near.
