Well, most Steven Seagal fans know I do not expect a masterpiece every time I make a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least one sorting budget. The main problem with the copy I tracked was terrible in terms of doubling. I know that in some films this must be done and I accept this, but when they overcome with a completely different voice of actors and continue to do so through the movie, the magic of overcoming. Also, the sets seem to be built with no care, as in a single scene, the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and I hope the next Stevens project will be finalized before sending the movie to buy / rent. The story of this movie I wondered if I was looking at a SF movie or not some parts seemed extraterrestrial but never fully explained what was happening. I find it very confusing.
