I bought this rather inexpensive ex-rental movie, believing that the coverage looks nice enough. And it was beautiful, but the movie is garbage. I can handle class B, sometimes I really enjoy a good B (ie, "The Nazi Survivor must die" is a classic example of how the genre can be fun), but it was only weak. The incredibly boring scenes have been broken too poorly by cheap and healthy pornography and horror dreams. This film has very little to offer.
