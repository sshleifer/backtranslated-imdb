I did not expect a movie as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it seems like this movie was made for television and made a mediocre job at best . The (good) cast could not hide the fact that the script was too predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try all they can, I think) through their bad scenes, giving them their characters pretty full extra. When I watched the movie, I had the feeling that I saw more in other (better) movies. In him there were car results, big blows, romanticism, plot overturning, etc .; This movie has none. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the Cuban character phone, you know who's behind all these suggestions and all the suggestions you give ("stay too close to the president , see it from my perspective ... ") sounds bad. <br /> <br /> If it was me (and maybe it is a good thing it is not) I would rewrite the plot like this: The first lady orders her husband to murder because she is ill and tired of writing checks all the time in Cuba.
