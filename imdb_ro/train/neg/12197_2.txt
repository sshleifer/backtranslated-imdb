Beast Wars is a show that is over-hyped, overpraised and overrated. Let's meet the characters of this unpleasant show whose creators must have been acid-based to try to make such a show. Cheetor - Seriously, they must have censorship bars on this guy. Why do not they hide their audience in the same voice as the Taz child? (at least Razzoff from Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is Expressed by Slip & Slide) Action Blast - If you want a show line that sucks, get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron-A show that should go down in a toilet. Creators of good jobs (Sarcasm) Show him that they are self-retarded and bored (at least Super Mario games are better) This show had a lot of followers who say I bring it back but I think it was canceled for his own sake.
