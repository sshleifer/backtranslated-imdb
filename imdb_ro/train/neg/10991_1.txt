My brother is a DVD avid collector. He glanced at the cover (two models on the toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I woke up to see what turned out to be probably the most difficult film (I use this free term). I felt compelled to stay. I did not dare contact with my brother, sure enough we had to curse the receipt in his tight fist. The biggest name of the film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in a single scene, which "the director" has decided to show each and every movie (about four). Actually, the whole movie follows this suit pretty much. The fact that the DVD contained deleted images was a shock. (I went to bed without seeing him, though). I was not surprising at all, I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later.
