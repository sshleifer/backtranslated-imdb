As is often the case, the impressive and explosive trailers in Asian movies add to nothing but unclear stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was wonderful) Dog Dog Bite tells a story where men are raised as ferocious wild dogs to meet their master's bid. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, immoral killer who is offset against an equally unstable police officer, are far from common heroes and negative characters that we often see. In fact, by the end, you lose track of who you should be empathizing, not even feeling the least excitement for any of the men? if this was the failure of his or her director, perhaps the message pointing out that trying to say is up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film has been filled with intrigue and unpredictability, half has led to a story of survival and revenge. The suspicion that was obvious at first disappeared due to an incorrect wrong music score that put out the potentially effective story. And, in the end, you were left feeling that all this detailed background information and insight into the main characters was in a way very useless. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, was the transition from story to point A to point B quite atypical compared to American films? so those who are not familiar with Asian films and have been tired of Hollywood's predictability should check this out. The white balance was across the length of the film. It was like watching a picture shot on fluorescence when it was supposed to be put on tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but he's stretched out my eyes. The movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you ?? an interesting construction gave me hope for the story of slow motion until she was redirected to a low-budget, low-budget scenario. And just when you think you're going to get an uninterrupted indie endless with a mixture of Shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it's not a end at all, but rather a transition to a wacky country music fit for peace and quiet. </ B> <br /> Throwing some hidosa, drowning scenes, an unexpected moment of redemption back in the wild and back again another way, Asian fascination with body fluids and a horrible music score that do not match the movie , and you get the thrill of the thrilling Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I simply do not understand why every battle scene was covered with clips of roaring lei ?? did I think she had to symbolize the dogs? Finally, in the end, is it reminding us of a real killer who is still hiding among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
