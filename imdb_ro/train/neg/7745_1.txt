Where to start? the special effects should be called special flaws. When the director shouted "action," I think he also indicated the actors to perform the worst performances they might think. Perhaps it was disturbed by the producers and wanted to make sure they would not recover a single penny of their investment and that the work would be a case study on how not to make a movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family did not let him. The only thing that is sure that anyone who uses it in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous references.
