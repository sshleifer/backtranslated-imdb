Think of "stage play". It's worth seeing once for the shows of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Together with Melvyn DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas in this movie. Are there vampires in freedom in this "Bavarian" village, or is there a more natural, though sinister explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is expressed as a particularly morous character. It's fun to look at its different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. It's not going too long for a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's smoking physician is the real killer. There is too much "comical relief," but this is true for the course of this era. Fay Wray looks very good.
