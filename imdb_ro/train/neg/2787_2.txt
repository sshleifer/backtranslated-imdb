Through the story of Kid (Prince), a singer, on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. I saw this in a theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince but I liked the three great songs of this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The concert scenes in this film are wonderful - full of energy and enthusiasm. Unfortunately, this is a very small portion of the movie. The story is obvious striking and has been done several times before - and much better. Subplots are, to put well, wrongly handled. The triangle of love between Day Kid, Appolonia, and Morris was so predictable and tired that I was actually insulted. His father beating his wife is necessary for the story, but the scenes are so hardly manipulated (in acting and in the direction) that I could not believe it. The script is a terrible, stupid dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And here they are miserable of misogyny - Kid's mother is beaten; The child who hits Appolonia and (undoubtedly) Appolonia the stripes and goes swimming without swimming to a dirty river. Also, the characters of Williams and Princes treat women horribly constantly. The actor is the place where this movie really does not succeed. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (with ease) the greatest actor I've ever seen. His black face and the delivery of wood dialogue are so bad I could not believe it. This film comes just for life during the concert scene, but there are not many. The "dramatic" scenes are so badly manipulated and manipulated that they make this film a chore in order to stay. He should have made this concert movie. I give this 2 - only for music.
