The subject seems pretty dated today. Adapted for television from Rona Jaffe's book; we are traveling and looking for a fantasy existence. Four college students are deeply involved in playing a live version of Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). A player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantastic world too deep. His co-players have to get to rescue and save him from self-harm. David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the game with four. The support is made up of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. At this time, it seems to be spent and tainted. But the highlight of the view sees Tom Hanks between the salad days of Bosom Buddies and his big spot in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of the spectators will have the greatest pleasure.
