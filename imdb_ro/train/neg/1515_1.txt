I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the casting of Gere and the Danes, and because the synoptic of the story sounded interesting. This was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen (and I've seen some turkeys.) I've never posted anymore online, but this movie was so terrible that I had to do that. I assume the problems start with the script that was so amateur, it's incredible. The story has nonsense and the dialogue is so nice it's wrong. Poor Gere, deserve much better. As for the Gere / Danes match on the screen, because of the horrible writing, no character is thought for a single minute. I bet Gere wants to buy the negative, that it was possible. It's a shame to see the lost talent so bad, not to say I want to take 2 hours back. (I know what you think, how do I really feel?)
