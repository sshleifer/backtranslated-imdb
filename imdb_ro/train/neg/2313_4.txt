Shintar√¥ Katsu has won tons of fame by playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unbelievable concept - a blind guy is Japan's greatest swordsman and spends every movie pointing his mistakes and excessive pay to those who do bad. He is a good boy and the movies are interesting and addictive (actually, I saw every movie). That's why we've seen this last installment of the Hanzo Razor series, as we assumed it would be very similar ... and the boy was wrong! It seems that Hanzo movies are extremely sexual and also promotes the rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a Meiji policeman and regularly takes the wicked into custody and interrogates them through the violence of violating them with the "steel penis." How you made such a strong member is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for squeamish. In general, I can not recommend that someone sees these violent and misogynist films. However, from examining the other reviews, I see that I'm still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite some decent and stunning fighting scenes, movies are just like a brain pollution - and I would like to imagine how the films would contribute to violence against women.
