Mark Hamill should have felt embarrassed by summer CORVETTE! This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain the possession of his dream car, a bright red vet. It seems that another teenage age sinks in the first half hour and makes a turn in the wrong direction. Writing and routing are terrible, with some scenes that you can hardly take away. You will expect this to happen anyway and also smell the smell of the late '70s. Only a newcomer, such as Annie Potts, will easily steal the show and save this bad film from repopulations! Her impractical but delightful personality is in your interest forever, and this is the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Answer Annie! I'm sorry, Mark! I think the Force was not with you this time.
