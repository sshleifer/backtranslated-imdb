The worst movie I've seen for a long time. An interesting first half, with an appealing and peculiar dialogue between dubious characters in a late bar. The film then degenerates into an unmoving sequence of visual shock scenes (read disgust) without any remark or redeeming lesson in humanity or anything else. I wanted to go, but the director was present at this, and my politeness prevents me from showing him a lack of respect. However, time is precious (as the director even noticed in the intro) and even suicide me with the time I lost in the second half of this year. The saving of graces was the three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female one.
