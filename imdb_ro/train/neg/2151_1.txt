This is a hybrid creature born to Carl Macek's mind. With Robotech Second Generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in a miserable movie, they have no logic! The story is very, very bad and you can not forgive Megazone action when it has nothing to do with Robotech. If this movie has such a high rank, it's for the TV series and not for itself! I said it, the name can not save it!
