My sincere advice for all: do not watch the movie. Do not get close to the theater where this movie is playing! even a piece of it is bad for health. seriously. no jokes. it is 3.30 am. and I came back from this worst movie in this universe. FOUR PEOPLE !!! I'm proud to have survived everything! If it's called survival. I'm very frustrated. irritated. disappointed. it was a waste of time! the money went into the sewer! no plot. I hope I wake up healthy tomorrow and no memories of this night! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Birthday of the United States to one and all :)
