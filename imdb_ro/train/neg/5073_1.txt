The Tree of Palms teasers try to pass it like a sort of allegory for a real-world fairy tale, then start moving about animation right away. I should have known what this means. The main staff, Palme, is a good example of the whole film problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero looking for himself, the next being a violent psychopath with an unhealthy attachment to a girl he once had. Like all the characters in the film, Palme is poorly defined. You have nothing to do with the characters, although Shatta has gotten some fancy girls. It seems the writer was more interested in filling all the drama and complexity he could have done in this film than actually exploring the motivations and personalities of his characters. In the last fifteen years, new stories of unnecessary movie minutes have been introduced. The writer was serious enough to rationalize his story. Maybe it was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help wondering if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been more appropriate for a TV series or a graphic novel. In the last five minutes of the film, it lacks the quality of laughter and laughed at the way the characters, relationships, and the whole plot were invented. I touched my comrade, and he also started, like a young man behind us. We tried so hard to control, but we just could not take the terrible quality of this movie. On the brilliant side, the animation is incredible and the viewers will feel admired by the lush background and charming drawings. Animation guides you closely; when you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
