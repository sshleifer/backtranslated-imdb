I just watched her, I and my better half could not believe how terrible and bad he acted was. If someone thinks well, then you have to be easy to please. In fact, I gave up one night to look at it, everything was done before. IE. but at least that did not make you ask badly and with the lack of story line, with the same old things, re-haired, I read so much about this film, I even recommended it to my colleagues, my guilt, someone said he was fine! not horrible, horror or reeling in disgust than the "terrifying movie" medium should be said, please do not worry about this movie. bring your boys. now that's scary! I left now, go to the cinema and look at something more frightening than that, maybe a little sun
