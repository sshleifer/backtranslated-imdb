It's just put, the worst movie I've ever seen. It varies from 2 hours, and the art of the box was totally misleading. My friends and I hired it because, I thought it would be a poor man of 300. You know, laugh and have fun. Not. There is nothing fun about this movie, just pain. Then the movie starts and speaks a different language. We think, "Oh, it's just the beginning." But no, the movie collapses and becomes more like a super tedious book that you should read in primary school, where nothing literally happens for hours, and battle scenes rival with those of the two kids who are fighting in a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this movie belongs to the garbage compactor. Such films will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which was a good movie.
