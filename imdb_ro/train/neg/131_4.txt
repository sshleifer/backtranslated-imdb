So where are the cannibals? Those interested in the title and the appeal of the "true cannibal" of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we were shown a strange man and re-visiting a village in Papua New Guinea full of locals, one of whom was his boyfriend a few decades ago. The man, Tobias Schneebaum is a New York Jew while they come and, in a way, this intertwines with the documentary as it appears in yamika in several scenes. There are no real cannibals here: only stories transmitted by some locals and even by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinema. Schneebaum remains extremely sympathetic and gives us a fascinating look at a life that is as far from Western civilization as it can be. parcel summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
