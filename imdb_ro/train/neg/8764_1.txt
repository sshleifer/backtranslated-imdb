This movie was absolute torture. First of all, it lasts for 4+ hours! It is true that the Kargil war could have had some points that were captured and fought for, but each of these battles should not have been shown. Perhaps this is a documentary, not a commercial movie as advertising. Of course, it did not look like this because there was not enough background information and there were some flaws. Battle sequences were so badly executed. I am very disappointed by the man who gave good sequences in Border. Each battle was exactly the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This could be a spoiler.) The whole army marks up, five curse soldiers five thousand times each (I use the same cussword every time), one of the main actors is shot, someone yelling for a stretcher, the actor says: No, you do not get a stretcher that will take 6 men out of the battalion, "and then an actor dies. The same thing happens always and quickly. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so much. The distribution of the film is too great for its good. Despite such a long film, none of the characters have been well developed. The actresses had tiny roles. Everyone is dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were crying in sync. It was so comic. They moved their hands and heads at the same time, and then they wiped away with them. <br /> <br /> The list continues and continues. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyway, I think I shot the movie enough to get the picture.
