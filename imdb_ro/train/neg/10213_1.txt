Many people seemed to like the movie, so I feel bad about giving it a wrong review. But after spending 96 minutes, I think I have to do that. Where the hell is the plot in this movie? Perhaps I missed it, I was waiting for the story to be revealed, and nothing happened. Of course the end was "somewhat shocking", but they did not grow. I forgot who was half the time, so they did not really develop the characters. The actor was so, most of the time he was credible, but I managed to see through him most of the time. So ... without giving anything, I have to say that if you do not like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I did not understand why there was too little or too much of the movie. I can not decide what it is, so I say judge for yourself. I do not even know if renting would be a good idea, the cost and all ... Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Actress: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel really too big, I I stand with my vote up.
