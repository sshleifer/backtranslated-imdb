I'm a big fan of Stooges, but the only quality that deserves this movie is that Curley is in it. Done long before he begins to drink much, he is his classic self in this (and Larry is not bad). Moe's character is a right (especially) and this movie would be better called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that none of the Stooges movies were really good (in my opinion), but, as a commentator here said, how sad it is that this movie has real potential. The tower was good, it was well guided, filmed and edited, but the story line tried to be something serious, with only a few Stooges antiques and musical numbers (which I think was right then) thrown in. Do It During This Movie You Should Believe It Should Be Better Than To Laugh Lawn And Take Garbage (Which Is Understanding) is to wait for Curley / Larry scenes and to sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat in the rest of the time.
