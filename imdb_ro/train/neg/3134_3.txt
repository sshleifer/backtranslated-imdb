"The Fallen" falls under the "Waste of Life" category (WOL). I am sad that I am two hours older I was not entertained. The other members of my family also watched this movie and threw disturbing comments on the screen and rooted for the mummy. I'm sorry for the actors (Wagner). I've read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie, otherwise it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30-minute slot on the TV without any loss of plot. It reminds me of some kind of food that has some good ingredients, but when served it is gentle with no flavor. In my humble opinion, the 42-meter mummy had to be 8-10 meters and improved the plot by removing the mystic and replacing it with more people who want to dengue the facts and want DNA samples for bad reasons. Heroes are discredited and thrown there by their peers. Later, after everything was deceived by evil men. Heroes would save the day and prove that everyone is wrong.
