Simply, this is the worst film from the "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked that movie, you probably will). What did they think? Some ideas should remain just an idea. The fact that this idea might be herself filming should be a criminal offense. What was so bad about that I heard you asked. One word ... everything. The cost to rent: $ 4.50 Cost in time to track: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund on both!
