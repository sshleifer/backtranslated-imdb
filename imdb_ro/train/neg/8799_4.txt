Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours in the makeup room every day to show Zola's side. Muni was one of the greatest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - other than those who love the classic movie - know something about it. He has been a business giant for at least a decade. She could have won the Academy Award for this show, which would have given her two in a row, earning her for Louis Pasteur's role a year before. My opinion is that while he tended to overtake a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "golden age." Every part played; you were ripped on the screen by looking at him. Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought this story struck a bit of what I saw over the past 60 years: passing overboard to make a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its contempt for police or military, making it a point to tell us how these organizations are "corrupt". People love him only when authority is provoked and defeated. In this sense, this film is long before its day since we saw this great time in the 1960s. However, it is worth noting the facts that support this story. It also does not diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer, escaping some evils. Good for him! I wish I'd spent more time pointing this out than concentrating on a trial.
