From time to time, someone in the blue looks at me a little laterally and asks, "What about SNITCH'D?" I immediately know they have a case of fun and horror barely hidden. You see, I was the cameraman of the movie. Let me clarify some points about this "exciting life experience." Secondly, SNITCH'D was called ONE HIT HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a very small feature of 35mm which, like many other indie features of the era, have never been distributed despite the festival's distinctions ... has fallen victim to the fine print of SAG's notorious experimental experience contract. But I do ... though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to shoot the little gangster at 16mm, with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000, I do not want to get out of peace, I got it . After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... And I believed the myth then. <br /> <br /> Let's do just like 'movie school' for many involved, including myself. SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill learned Drama at a high school in the last city (yes, he is a drama and English teacher ... he believes while watching the movie or even observing the use of the apostrophe in the title), hence the locations and distribution. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that I get a movie under her belt. I have to say that her professional dedication, focus and attitude "to do that" kept me inspired and was a prefiguration of her star - who is just coming. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, more boom du jour operators and an uncorrected offline delivery for dubbing. Nothing in this shades the real content that speaks for itself. However, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors (at a net loss, I understand), which inexplicably had no photos of Eve (until then was a growing name), but who managed to get a photo clear of what seems to be an authentic latin gangster to give SNITCH'D credibility. Since Cahill's other passion is the antichrist book, he seems to confirm that he thinks you can actually judge a book by covering it ... as many have taken this DVD on its lever. - A year later, Eve, now on a soap, and I met James someday to shoot a short short film he had made, SPLIT SECOND, which I think he never saw piece despite the festival's intention. <br /> <br /> Six years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill movie titled JUAREZ, Mexico. Although he developed this process; my participation was conditioned by scenario and crew control, and the resulting film was actually promising in the newspapers, what was ... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murder of Juarez girls? Despite the allegations here and elsewhere, the film NEVER has never appeared in any festival or event, although Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has been distributed and simply awaits launch to coincide with the launch of two studio pictures on same subject VIRGIN OF JUAREZ ORAS OF GRANITA.
