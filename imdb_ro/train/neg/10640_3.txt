From the uninspired title to flat performance, Curdled is very much an unprecedented film. The film won several fans by the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to it, and the bad and out-of-place knot for the movie "From Dusk to Dawn" to Rodriguez / Tarantino. These things do not make a wonderful movie and this is more than obvious all the way through the curdled. The film suffers from a lack of ideas and tries to mask this with crimes that are meant to be stylish and events that should be disturbing. The score of Mexican music that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cold, but it becomes very annoying; especially as the main character is Mexican, does not match the tone of the movie. The story of the film is usually unmatched and follows a gorehound who, due to her obsession with terrible killings, takes a job with a company that cleans the scene of murder. It sounds boring and it is. William Baldwin is the only "name" on the distribution list, and even he does not make an impression. Nothing has been done in the film and, apart from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look threatening, he's quite lost. Angela Jones or rather; the Pulp Fiction taxi driver takes the lead role as a young obsessed with killing, and it is always clear that her involvement in Pulp Fiction has won this role, not her ability to act. She may have been pretty good in her little role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she does not have the talent to lead a movie alone. It seems to be lost and lacking in place for most of the film and if it were not her latin accent; it would not convince the public that it is strange at any level. Curdled is a piece of garbage worth a hundred percent. Such films often gain praise for inventions or the black comedy; but this does not succeed at all levels. Whether you are a fan of Tarantino, a fan of William Baldwin, a fan of horror or just a movie boy; this is desirable.
