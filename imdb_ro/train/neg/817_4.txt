"You will not shoot those little creatures. First of all, they have not done you any harm, secondly, they could be radioactive." Ah, 50 years of science fiction? However, despite strange strangeness, Superman and Mole-Men are pretty uninspired going even with a long 58-minute running time. Is it more than cheap (Superman's only flight of flight is a few incredibly inept animation frames) and quite boring with him, although he has a surprisingly altruistic message? the Mole-Men mute, a diminutive skull and fur actors who look more like Mr. Mxyzptlk without a hat than the underground creators released from the underground world by drilling oil, are not evil, only misunderstood, and George's Steel Man Reeves to prevent the local small mafia headed by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
