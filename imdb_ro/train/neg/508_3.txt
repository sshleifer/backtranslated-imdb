The early film directed by D.W. Griffith; has a happy happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the Minstrel in the palace (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers lovers, he decides to take Edgar Allen Poe revenge. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear those plotting against them; although the actors try to look alternately noisy (lovers) and quiet (cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" look great. Performances are good, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The closed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
