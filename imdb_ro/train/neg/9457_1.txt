Almost everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. It has come to the point where you realize that its shtick has not changed since SNL's ten years ago. He does the same joke and the same voices with all kinds of consciousness. His cat is painful. He's trying to make it hard. He's a strange type A comic, not the cold cat he's supposed to do. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly - and clearly a loss of millions of dollars. (Cutting the background building card would have made more sense than building a neighborhood and a street). Alec Balwin tries to make a big impression on Santini, but ends up and seems incoherent. There is even an inconvenient moment with Paris Hilton famous celebrity cheese - which is in mind just because it should be a story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this movie at any cost, folks. Not even an interesting job on the train. (I hope that Horton Hears will be Who with Robin Williams. Then we'll have the trilogy of "Seuss").
