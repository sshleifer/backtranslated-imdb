All I could think of while watching this movie was a b-grade. Many have talked about the fact that the redemption of quality is how this film presents a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and of an individual and his subsequent spiral in a state of self-perpetuation of unfortunate events. However, the techniques used (as many have already mentioned) have been overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. As far as the plot is concerned, it was devoid of scale, unimaginable, implausible, and convoluted. You can read most of the other reports about this movie and they will say just like me. Some actors and actresses are attractive, but when they face such a boring action ... you can only wear a movie so far. The action is faint and intermittent: a few blows thrown here and there and a final blow to the end. Nothing is about writing about home. As others have said, "BAD" movies are great to watch even because they are "bad", you enjoy this fact. This movie, however, is a void. There is nothing. In addition, if someone really needs an educational movie to scare people out of drug use, then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that deal with such issues in a much greater way efficient. "Requiem for a Dream", "Trainspotting", "Fear and Wickedness in Las Vegas" and "Candy" are just a few examples. Although we should check out lighter movies on the same subject as "Go" (as a whole, both serious and funny) and "Halfbaked". In a final note, a single redemption line, Vinnie Jones's film was stolen from Lock, Stock and Two Barrels Smokling. To think that a bit of great movie has been affected by "Loaded" is vague. In general, I strongly suggest saving you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.
