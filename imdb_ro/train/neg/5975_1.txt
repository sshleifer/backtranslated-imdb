I never wanted to see this movie, then someday for a joke I saw to see how bad it was; my preconceptions have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I would like to question the politics of the film. She hides behind the mask of women, "making it big in the city," but the only way women can do it is by using their sexuality rather than by their intelligence or abilities. These women are nothing more forgiving. Are the little more attractive girls who are not allowed to be successful? This is not the only message on the right side of the movie, there are hundreds of American flag frames and huge budgets. A good example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and any spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even seen in this film. Money is described as the only important thing for young people. The bar manager says he does not allow drug users in her bar and then goes to salted gallons of alcohol down his neck and then the necks of his staff and clients. Anyone who knows anything about the intoxicants will know that the liqueur can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. And, finally, why are the scenes where the main character is a sex point of interest to the public (when she gets naked or her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We wanted to strip her camera with her feet while she was her father's phone. She "bid" her father just as she "bid" her boyfriend. That seems strange to me. In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading for women and sincerely, worrying. But what are you waiting for from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
