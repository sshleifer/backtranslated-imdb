The humor in Who is your father is such a poor taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Seal closures are not funny! No one thinks I am. People get nervous when they see something so brutal and hide their nervousness, laugh. Watching Who your father has given me a disgusting feeling of nervousness.
