I watched the pilot and noticed more similarities between 3 lbs and House, M.D. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially useless of choice, similar to Laurie's Character, but without the acerbic spirit that Laurie brings to the House. Meanwhile, Tucci's "right guy," Dr. Seger, does not develop into a more intriguing character, such as the "fair" boys Cuddy and Wilson. The character of Indira Varma, Adrienne Holland, is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor, Cameron, being a coincidence. Someone at CBS obviously noticed the success of the House, MD, and told staff to make it look similar, hoping the move would be successful. However, copying a House show requires the same high level of mood and suspense, and Tucci and the company are not as challenging. I did not know the show was canceled until I read comments about IMDb, but it is not a surprise to me.
