As a Rolling Stones casual listener, I thought it might be interesting. Not that because this film is very "old" in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s), this seems to me just a stupid hippie purist propaganda, but I'm sure this movie was not made for me, but for those who were active in the 1960s. I expected stones drugs, I was disappointed, actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much I felt like working with them to get a conclusion of this movie terrible. I have not seen any of the directors in other movies, but I suspect that he has a similar style of directing, a sort of "amatuerish" that gave a feeling that the Eurotrash TV show, bold, misguided, shot and worthless entertainment. My only good opinion about this is that we did not waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.
