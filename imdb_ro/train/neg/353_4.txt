As other reviewers have noticed, the film dies in the last half hour. However, before that, she suffers from the predictability and amazing performance of Kate Capshaw, who clearly has never found her character and ruins every scene they are in. Connery is fine as Fishbourne, but most of the scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth, with a feeling of unreality. And the end is simply bizarre. Film makers knew when they made that mess together that all they needed was sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to take Thanksgiving dinner to compensate for adding a "dramatically" overlapped score. Each small jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of bad movie in the league, it's one to see, otherwise you skip it.
