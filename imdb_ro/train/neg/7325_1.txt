Makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is the jaw dropping in how awful it is. Turning off the DVD player was not enough. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and push them around my face. I will never come back again. Not. How is it possible to create a banal, boring and soulless movie? I did not think of an action course to ease the tedium. Writing the ten necessary lines is incredibly difficult for such an honest piece. What can you say but reiterate how terrible the act is. Avoid.
