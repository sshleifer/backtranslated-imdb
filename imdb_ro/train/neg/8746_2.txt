The attacked object on Microsoft, made by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or market economics in general. Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of billing gates and is a cartoon character who orders right and left kill. While Microsoft can sometimes engage in anticompetitive activities, it is unlikely that they will kill people. Therefore, the movie is up and ridiculous from the beginning. The "deeper" point seems to be that important technological innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws. However, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for market incentives (and rewards) offered by intellectual property. It's one thing to be against anticompetitive behavior - - that's good sense. It is another that must oppose competition on the market first, which is, first of all, the mantra of the film ("knowledge belongs to mankind"). Another example of Hollywood being completely out of the reality.
