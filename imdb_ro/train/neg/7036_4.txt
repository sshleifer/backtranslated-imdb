I do not destroy anything when I inform you that you can see a woman having sex with a goat in this movie. If this is your job, then your movie has arrived. A woman and her husband go to see her sister alienated in the family mansion in the woods. Her sister is a ghastly lady to say at least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. On her side appears a group of stupid characters and she begins to adopt all kinds of heathen rituals. The plan is pretty weak and the characters are pretty bad. The woman gets stuck even after her husband begins to turn into a stupid man and stay with the heathens, even continue to have sex with him. On the exploitative side of things, there is a very tired flesh and a couple of couplings, but nothing that has been better anywhere else. Oh, and the scene of older goat sex. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not get to the end. The exploiters will drive it, but they will be left more. 4/10
