I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was a pretty big experience ... in shooting propaganda and boredom. We hoped the film could be a real documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, the UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, reduction and burning effort to prevent conservatives and the local religious community. It is certain he seems to serve a director who makes a documentary that reflects only his preconceptions about problems. What is most surprising is to see all the "10" votes that his homes have posted here. Did they even see the video? Golly Batman, this must fit into the All Men's President! Their ratings are as obvious as bias in this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, stacking votes at IMDb will help to a blade movie. Perhaps my vote will contribute to balance.
