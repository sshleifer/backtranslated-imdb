When it was released, I thought it was one of the most profane movies ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other filmmakers like him, there have been more basic movies worse in language than that ... but this is a pretty brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot, but that was ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a tenth use of the name of the Lord in vain and an impressive number of words. I wonder how many people came out of the theater following this in 1990? I could not have been the only one. It is not surprising that some of the actors involved include Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach, and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to improve his image, at least play Jackson "Stonewall" in "The Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is exactly the opposite: maybe the worst person in the movie and a character who falls in love with a travesty by the end of the movie. Depressing, grim, semi-pornographic, repugnant: these are just a few of the adjectives used by people-even some liberal critics-in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics, all of the extreme Libs, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics have been disgusted, as well as almost all paying audiences. It is unbelievable that anyone can praise the dirt and garbage of this kind. <br /> <br /> Trust this: there are no good, full of love characters in this movie. This is a sick movie, one of the worst in the "modern era". That's if you do not like to see child abuse, drug abuse, adolescent prostitutes, and beyond - two hours free of anything but atrocities and simply plain people. No, thanks.
