It is so sad that the Romanian audience is still populated with vulgar and uncrowned individuals who enjoy such cheap and demonstrative, superficial and brutal performances as the "Garcea" series or the "Big Holiday" games ... The difference is that Mugur MihÄƒescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-artisans never assume they will claim their performances as "art." Pintilie, who made a very good 40 years ago ("Sunday at six o'clock"), followed by another rather beautiful ("Reconstruction"), tries to declare the lengths of "artworks" - but from sadly, at a very limited level, the means of expression specific to cinema. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample of "HOW NOT" - this is just about its unique merit.
