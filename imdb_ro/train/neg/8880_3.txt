This movie was o.k. but it could have been a lot better. There are some scary moments, but they are not enough to make me ever want to see this movie again. There are a few scenarios that you could get through quickly and do not lose anything. The biggest flaw is that it's so predictable, and that's why we've rated it so low. It's traceable, but you do not expect anything wonderful.
