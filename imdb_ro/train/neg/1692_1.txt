Okay, if you saw The Ring, you saw The Grudge. Trying to be frightening, having just a strange camera activity and powerful sounds, but fails badly. Crying, if you can say it, is weak and quite full of holes, for example, how would you know the care center that Yoko did not appear for work when the people living in the house were not there? And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He went out of nowhere to advance the plot. It did not make much sense in what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, boy or father? And was Yoko alive or dead when the type of care center found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think more about it.
