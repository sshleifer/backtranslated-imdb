Polyester was the first John Water movie I've ever seen and I have to say that it was the most "worst" movie I've seen so far. The water group of "talents" included several people who are sure to have worked for food and were willing to say the lines that Waters wrote. Everything about the movie is terrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman played by the Divine transvestite of 300 lb was just absurd. That said I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny and you will not believe the shit that happens to the poor Francine. Her son huffs solvents and stomps women's unsuspecting feet at the grocery store. Her daughter is the prettiest slut in town. Her husband is a cockhole A-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to stir up and humiliate poor Francine. Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, probably the worst actress ever. Edith looks and seems to read the lines on a cue card and never saw the script before filming. Despite all the things Francine has done, Waters cooks a fabulous ending at Hollywood and everyone who survives) lives happily afterwards.
