I did a video recording of things. And I think it was the fourth attempt I've ever seen in the whole movie without going to sleep. It moves slowly, and the idea of ​​a platform in the middle of the Atlantic, which could have been revolutionary at the time, is now only a great yawnaroony. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the songs are quite forgetful, and only in the action event things become very interesting. When the water began to flow for a long time, even on one occasion it wakes me up. But give the man his duty. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not shoot him between his index and his fingers as smaller mortals. He holds it in his fingers while he shows us the old brown pearls. There are some scenes in this movie where smoke is heading towards the sky on a dark background and looks very artistically. But do not say too much about this film if anything that impresses you is tobacco smoke.
