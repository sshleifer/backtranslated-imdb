Oh dear, what a terrible movie. The production was so cheap and ugly ... Remember shooting from "Natural" where the lightning strikes the tree (leaving a glittering knocker) that Roy Hobbs makes a knock out of ?? Well, the producers of this film used the same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch came into the house. I wonder if they paid to use The Natural or did they just hope that anyone watching the movie would take it? Then at the end they were trying to escape into the truck. Such an excessive action in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A very bad movie, a very bad movie.
