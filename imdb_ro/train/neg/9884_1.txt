I was a fan of Without A Trace in the premier episode. I really can not express my disappointment in last week's episode. This is a real problem that too many Afican-American families have treated and continues to do. The lack of critical media coverage over the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. Law enforcement including local, state and federal authorities is also complicated. What was the purpose of publishing this topic and then putting out the end? Apparently, television can handle almost any subject except the breed. This is shameful. Take it together or do not explore it next time.
