The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of Max Antique collector (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his friendly friend and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy the story, he dominates Jack and puts him in the chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000 to protect him in a negotiation of the ancient "Spanish judges" with a rich and dangerous collector. Max asks Mark Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend, who thinks he is on Mars, to make up the reserve team. However, Jack double-crosses the collector and then intruders Jack, Jamie and Piece. Low budget "Spanish judges" is a movie with a reasonable scenario with a terrible conclusion that loses a good distribution. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but with the good actor, Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save the stupid story. In addition, scenes that should be fun, unfortunately, do not work and, in fact, they are stupid and not funny. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("All for Money")
