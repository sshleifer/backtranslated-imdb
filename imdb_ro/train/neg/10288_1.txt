First I just want to say I like this show !!! But this episode ... this episode is a mockery of the whole show. I do not know what they tried to do with this episode, but they successfully created the MULTI episode of the series. <br /> <br /> There is no line of story, everything is chaotic and jokes ..... they are nonsense. The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example, "what furling looks" by creating that stupid "before ..." ... ... is simply embarrassing. It is clear that writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad.
