You know you have problems when your movie has many alternative titles. Generally, they have tried and tried to hide the turkey on different markets. Such a turkey is the Brain Machine, which has seven different titles. It's about a super-secret government project that is supposed to be able to use a computer to read people, but instead drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that. It is filled with B-level TV actors sitting in the window room and lawn chairs, trying to act on a scenario that makes no sense. It is a turkey of a bad nature. Avoid it.
