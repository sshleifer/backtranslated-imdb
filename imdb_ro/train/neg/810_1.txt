If you are one of the people who find "According to Jim" a great television comedy, it will stir up your world. And I might add, kudos to prove that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need in any other network than ABC, who prefers to fancy the air that Jim Belushi's year looks like year after year. > "K-911" is a "great thank you" for all geniuses who loved the first film. This is exactly what the fans of that film and the smaller Belushi deserve. Jim's comic faces and project choice are never far behind his ability to slaughter a standard blues. Try him to try to show all his various talents in his every project he throws to the public as a surplus zoo chimp. If you enjoy Jim's work, the movie is your reward.
