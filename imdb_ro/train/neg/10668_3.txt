This movie had some awesome actors in it! Unfortunately, they forgot how to act. We hoped the movie would improve as it went, but the action was so robotic that it was condemned from the very beginning. It actually occurred that actors could read the script all the time. Maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is certain that the Make-up artist needs to get another job! The facial powder was so thick that you could see shit on the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder she did not hit the theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods is ashamed of you not giving it all. The plot was great, it needed a lot more.
