This movie reminds you that Bollywood is just a Hollywood parasite. Bollywood has a tendency to join past successes to promote its industry. Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this film with the premise that a mix of "Deewar" and "On the Waterfront" cocktails will bring home an Oscar. It turned out to be a debut mistake. Even the idea of ​​the title is inspired by the classic Elia Kazan. Originally, Brando is shown as growth pigeons as a symbol of peace. Bollywood must move out of the Hollywood shade if it has to be taken seriously.
