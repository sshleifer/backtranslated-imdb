Can A-Pix ever do anything right? This movie was designed to be seen on TV in a mailbox format. Because A-Pix does not even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with a shoulder on the right. Of course you did not miss too much. This movie is incredibly bad. It's really hard to enjoy a movie where the characters scream at the tip of their lungs during 80% of the film for no reason.
