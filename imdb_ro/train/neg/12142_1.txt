Please, for the love of God, do not follow him. Now, saying that, I know what you're thinking, can not it be so bad? If everyone says so badly as they say, I have to look! Do not do it! It will be like watching a horrible accident involving small children and a gas tank! You will be cruel for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could only watch for half an hour before I became violently ill. The act is the worst I've ever seen and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk having fun and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! Cover and story are a trap! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same ... right? NOT!! Written = carp targeting = garbage handling = there was no action. Are not they still convinced? Then forever your soul will be tormented!
