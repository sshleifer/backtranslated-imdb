James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what ever played a part in this piece of unpleasant trash. Affleck is just a lightweight machine that can not cut it, the rest of the songs are really unforgettable. I saw this in the US in an empty theater, soon I knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I went before the end was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I returned to England, I saw that the movie had a brilliant report from that yoyo "Paul Ross" on one late Sunday on the market . I always rely on Ross to save myself on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, I go straight to this website to check it out. This movie should have gone directly to the Â£ 1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you.
