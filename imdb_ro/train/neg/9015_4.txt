The first 45 minutes of the Dragon Fighter are fully acceptable and surprisingly tracked. Characters are credible and interesting. The cloning lab really shows high technology. After that, everything collapses. Characters begin to behave idiot, and a new subplot is introduced nowhere in connection with a fusion reactor (and is supposed to be "present"), criticism, the only justification for the plot being that it is necessary to kill the dragon - t. The finish is incredibly thin. One wonders what made a movie that began so badly to become so wrong. All the characters, except Dean Cain, are interpreted by the Russians. This results in strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova being called "Bailey Kent," despite its heavy accent (and, in spite of it, in one case, the unexplained transition to * Spanish *! ) Because of the decent start, I thought this movie was rated 5, but it was really more disappointing than that, so I only give 4.
