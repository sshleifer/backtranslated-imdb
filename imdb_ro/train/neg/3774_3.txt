This movie is outdated, and does not succeed. He is far, as compared to Batman 89, that he is trying to shoot himself. The singer woman, which is her name, can not act and see why her film bearer died. Notice how this movie died in the box office, no one sees this movie on television. My uncle and father were waiting for Batman, and the impressions of the film are more like Cop Rock. It's not worth renting 3/10
