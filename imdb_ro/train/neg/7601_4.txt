This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer is treated in many fine scenes in Los Angeles in the thirties - I particularly enjoyed the vision of the carriage approaching the tunnel and the trams climbing up the hill - but in some ways this excellent car cinema - defeat, because it creates a mood that "something will happen" - and nothing happens. The script keeps too much of a plot or action or trauma - and, from time to time, it is not delivered. We do not even offer the theme (suppose) of the film, the essential lack of characters. The top actors, so cute for their roles, did not send any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any. Now, Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well modeled, so perfectly played that I wanted the room to follow him.
