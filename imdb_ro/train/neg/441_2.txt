We do not have this on television in England, but we went over the Internet on YouTube. He's stupid, immature and boring! This is from the creator of "The Earthworm Jim" Douglas TenNapel, I did not get into that cartoon, but I have to admit it better than that. The cartoonist has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a comeback travesty and a low all-time! The story is about three cats who inherit a house and a bunch of money from their old master. They are arguing and continue to disagree on what they want to spend their money on. "BORING"! The animation is awful. The main characters are meant to be cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Only strange monster animals with big mouths, sharp teeth and Bulgarian eyes! Human characters and other animals are also really ugly drawn! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Stories are also blades and are most likely copied from older performances. She surprised me how this show received 7.5 / 10 votes from other IMDb viewers. Television is not what it is used to be! But now most of them are stupid, cheap and boring. Some of you on the site may not agree with me, I'm sorry, but this is a total loss of money and a total and total loss of your time and you enjoy the fact that the UK does not tolerate this shit ( oh yes if you have digital you have to) but I do not, so do not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it's very lucky to get it because I gave the worst performances!).
