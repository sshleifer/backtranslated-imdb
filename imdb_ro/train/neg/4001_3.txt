After hearing so much about the Cracker series of the 1990s without seeing anyone, I have been looking forward to this with eager anticipation. Surely the combination between Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane did not go wrong. How bad I was! <br /> <br /> Policies, backed by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were strong. Production has tried to be supermodern, but intermittent blanks and even the font of irritated children. Robbie Coltrane was asleep throughout the two hours, coming up with unexplained and improbable "intuitions," and the police were portrayed as unusual idiots. As a result, tension has never been built, and the next scene (without spoiler fear) was just as bad a television drama as we have long seen. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see any of them again, but I'll go back to the 1990 series DVDs to see if they match their reputation.
