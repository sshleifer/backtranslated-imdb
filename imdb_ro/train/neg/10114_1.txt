This is one of the worst movies ever. I like cheesy movies, but this is simply terrible. Where are the movie images that are on the box? I think more money was spent on DVD box illustrations than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a company release a DVD that cover is so deceptive? I feel like such an idiot for renting this film strictly on the box. As much as I explore IMDb, I should have done a little research and made a list before visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to come except for me. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, instead of taking cocktail umbrellas in your eyes. It will be much more enjoyable. You were warned!
