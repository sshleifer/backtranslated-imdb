He did not hit Korman, being very fun at the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' movies (High Anxiety "comes to mind). He is not, however, a person who can wear a movie in duel roles no less. This is basically a knockoff "Gremlins", following a tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". There is no very good knockoff on a tie with "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tune because it's not where almost as dark as the movie took. In fact, it's too bright and fuzzy, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up collapsing. Although I gave her a score of 3 for a score, this is due only to the movie that is even worse "Gremlin" knockoff. If you looked at Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know what I'm talking about ... the infamous Hobgoblins. He has a guy who finds a little critter in an underground (I just saw this movie a long time ago, so I do not remember everything clear) and starts pretty friendly. However, this creature becomes quickly unfriendly and, of course, more are generated and this is the movie. More than kicks in the joke department, and it's also very lame to see Korman playing the bad brother role. Best to skip this, but you may want to check it just for kicks.
