I'm glad I rented this movie for one reason: its shortcomings have made me want to read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pro: The movie is beautiful, the period is described well and consistently (to my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn are doing good. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's the worst thing I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I was wondering if something was wrong with my mouth. (And I hate the terrible English way that Transito says) Winona Ryder does nothing credible except looks young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are OK, but so few things hang together in the character springs and the development of relationships that I was frustrated and angry before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious now if this movie is typical for Bille August's work. I might have to get two more dollars to rent Smilla's Snow Feeling.
