Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beaten, beaten, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spit, perforated, sodomized and abused, and left dead by Madonna's terrible performance. Her acting was very similar to a graduate of the School of Dramaturgy and Public Speaking Al Gore. Guy Ritchie made a somewhat noble attempt to remodel this, and if you exclude ALL of his wife's scenes, it's the best honest film. I think the best job had to convince his wife that her performance was good enough not to reprogram. If you have the opportunity to watch Half or to toss your toes for 89 minutes ... go to extended pedicure.
