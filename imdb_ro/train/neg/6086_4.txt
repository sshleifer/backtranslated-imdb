For some reason, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the local CBS station in New York continued to play this film in its late slot on Fridays or Saturdays for several years, usually at 2am in the morning or at such a moment. It's a good movie for that time because it's very hard to watch and pretty weird (see the other story information reviews). Anyway, after having captured him many times in those days just before the cable television (And even after I hit him, but before giving them much programming all night), I kept this little strangeness. After I did not see him for many years, I decided to see if I could find him on DVD. Well, it's available (from any searches I've done anyway) in a strange print on the Brentwood Video label as part of a 4-pack (4 double-sided discs ) Alien Worlds "If someone is interested, it's usually available for about $ 10 - but much less if you shop around." The other 3 films on this set are available in many other public domain movie collections, so there is no need to comment on them here but I did not see the "Eye" available anywhere else. Although not at all a "restored" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so once the time 90-minute IMDb operation is not fair. Even with 92 minutes of running time, it's not unusual for a movie to be copied in English from another language and have some of the running time Se it seems to be a common practice of budget consciousness that sometimes saves money without worrying about copying scenes unless they are considered to be important to the story. A longer version would make it less confusing? Who knows - unless you have seen it in your native language ... By the way, my attempts to track this during the day do not work and I just stop to stop it. There's something about watching this in the middle of the night that fits only with this movie ... or maybe it's just from my previous experiences, who do I know?
