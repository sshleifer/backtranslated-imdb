I think I've seen worse movies, so I give a 3, but it's a fight to remember what could have been! Eventually Xtro (ugly and boring) or possibly Creep (just boring), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say he's a poor man under Under Siege, with Jean Claude Van Damme, a poorer man. The only redemption feature was to see Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after the Starship Troopers. Yeah, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. Judging from this site, he was stuck in the film of hell in the film .... Casper, be more selective .... please! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I have just returned and there is a decent film on Criminal Law ...... I'm beginning to feel very resent in the last 1.5 hours!
