I saw Peter Jackson's version of Lord of the Rings when I was half-reading the two towers and I thought he was absolutely brilliant. At this moment, the animated version of Lord of the Rings was released on DVD, but I told myself that I would finish reading the two towers and returning kings before watching her (as I thought the whole trilogy had shown). So when we finished the trilogy went and brought the DVD, which was a bad idea because it was absolutely garbage. I was bored for 20 minutes now, which was really weird because I like the book and I am shocked that the producer in this movie might even think to match at least one and a half of the books in a 2 hours 8 minutes. None of the characters had emotions when they talked and they seemed to read it from a page, even my favorite character, which is Gandalf, did not seem at all interesting. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only one in order in parts of the movie, except for the orcs (they looked terrible) and Aragorn and Sam's face. I do not know how this movie was released because there was not even an adequate conclusion, but maybe it was good that the producer ran out of money because the movie could not improve. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will judge the books through this movie
