this reality of the best celebrity shows a view ever. we can see the concerts that we can see Britney's life, I like the five episodes. I was always surprised by Britney and the subjects of the show I guess some people do not look at the show at all we can like a big person. she is truly fun, really gentle and loves fans and we can see how he loves his work. I just do not give a 10 because k-fed him a really stupid he does not seem to like Britney at all. I'm making a second season of this great show because it shows people how Britney really is. Go Britney the best and you will never leave our hearts.
