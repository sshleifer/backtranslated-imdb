This movie was a disappointment. I look forward to seeing a good movie. I am the type of person who starts a movie and does not stop it until the end, but I was forced to stop him. The reason I did not stop was that I am a great fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him act in him. I was really speechless after we finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thanks to Christian Slater for putting humor in him. If you were not in this movie, I would have been bored of my mind. I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must remain in acting. Until the movie was over, I did not even get the story. I was so confused and angry.
