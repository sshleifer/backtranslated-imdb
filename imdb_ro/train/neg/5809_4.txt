I do not see why filmmakers are remodeling this movie. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was a remarkable actor, and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his play. Also, the action from the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It is almost boring, despite the fact that filming in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. I do not understand how Baldwin was shut down in Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story. So, I think it was not necessary to remake it or if they decided to remember a classic, they have to choose an excellent actor for the first role, such as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
