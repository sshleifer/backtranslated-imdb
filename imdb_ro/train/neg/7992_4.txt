I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on TV. I remember the premise of the movie is that a bunch of occupants of the hotel are attacked by ants that eat men. What I did not remember was what HELP! He recently took this film on TV late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because such films usually disappear from existence and are never found again! Suzanne Somers (at the top of her career, playing Chrissy on "The Three's Company") plays a conceder at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers install an outside pool and accidentally disrupt an ant nest. Or should I say, a NEST * MAN-EATING ANTS '!! One of the workers is attacked by ants. One minute he takes their clothes one by one, the next minute he is covered in them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. If you thought it was pretty much accepted, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheelchair resident who gets airy from Manor by helicopter! I could almost imagine him thinking he was out of the air! The final scenes describe Suzanne, Robert Foxworth, and a third guy sitting on the floor in a hotel room with their backs one on the other, blowing through straw and covering with ants. This is basically the movie. There is really no "disaster" or "big-star" call to the movie. It was intended to be a "big-scale" TV event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it gets spilled in 4:00 hours on your local TV station. If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at its best, then watch an episode of Three Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy doing something to put the bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
