Dahmer, a confused young man. Dahmer, a confusing film. We had a few beers while watching the movie, but that does not explain why I was bored with this move. His flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there is no real story with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and end of the movie. Inbetween things, which would be the movie, are just boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I never see the actual crimes, it's all just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you even have a feeling that Dahmer dreams everything but you know it is not, since it is based on a true story, and that has happened, at least for the most part. But what happened? It's not easy to say. I do not encourage people to waste their time in this movie. I did not like it a bit, and I felt cheated when it ended suddenly. <br /> <br /> * / *****
