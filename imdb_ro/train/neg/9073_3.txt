The movie seemed promising, but it was actually pretty bad. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried the finest things with limited material but could not rise above the average spirit of this college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again extremely irritating - even more than in Rushmore, the rest of the distribution were quite non-full of events. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting & incredibly juvenile. Try to be a street / American Pie journey, but you are not in a state of discomfort at all levels. A total loss of everyone's time.
