From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and difficult to handle, that the outcome is completely predictable. Any good manuscript writing scripts will recommend character reinforcement, incorporating character arcs and a three-act structure. You will not find anything in this movie. Policemen are evil and therefore are shown to be superficial, incompetent, and cowardly. Never seems to happen to filmmakers that police officers could be honorable citizens who consider that joining the police is a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society. The visitor does not have the chance to join his mind or his if Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him go to the door of a gaol, but only to know he was in for three years when I heard that much later in a dialogue. This film contains many photos of Ned looking at the room with a serious expression. I found the movie a real move to watch. It's the direction of modern movies, and that stops me from forgetting.
