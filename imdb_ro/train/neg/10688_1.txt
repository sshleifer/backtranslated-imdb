I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I could not believe when the movie was over and I had absolutely no idea what happened ..... I was crazy because I could have used that moment to do something else ... I tried to figure out everything but he really had no idea. Thanks to those who figured out and explained it ... good or bad, it's better than not knowing anything! Who was the lady in the dark-haired movie I saw several times when we were away? How did the first lady learn that her husband is deceiving her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would eventually learn the truth. Does that mean we will be subjected to the end of game 2?
