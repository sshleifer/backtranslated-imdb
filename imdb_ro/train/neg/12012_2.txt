The dialogue was pretty awful. Crying is not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents. Not amazingly visual. In fact, sometimes disturbing visually. The safest one of those movies find it easier to end if you hold a finger on the button fast forward. If you could watch it for free, you have absolutely no other option open at this time and you are tired of seeing the little Poltergeist lady ... maybe I would recommend it but not everyone else I could to think it now.
