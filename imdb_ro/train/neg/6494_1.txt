I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would do as a writer / director. We could not be more disappointed with this move. The movie was so disjointed and the cinema was so outdated that I wanted to remove the plug from the wall. The actors were very good, but it was a loss of talent. Not all actors are disconnected from being writers or directors, and clearly, Mr. Hopkins enters this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in the 50s, it's absolutely the worst movie ever. Please do us a favor to Mr. Hopkins and stay in acting, which you are excellent, and let the writing and guidance of those who are talented in these areas. If I could give this movie a lower rating than one, I would certainly be.
