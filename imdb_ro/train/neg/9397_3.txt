I've seen most of the RMFTM episodes as a teenager at Cliffhanger Theater that took place after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then when the Mystery Science Theater riffed him in the early 90's. he was good with him. <br /> <br /> I can certainly enjoy the special effects that were quite impressive for a 50-year-old series (Commando Cody's scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman in his television show). And I can also compensate myself for ahem, "act", and fight with choreography -. except for the guy who plays the Moon's leader. He is incredibly miserable. He looks and behaves like a man who comes to repair your sanitation, not the despotic ruler of a foreign race. Even the corny dialogue works well - everyone flies their lines like firecrackers without losing time or breaks for things like "thinking" or "introspection." Since everyone does this, the viewer considers him immersive after a while, and even to my modern sensibilities, does not bother him too much. <br /> <br /> What truly irritates me is writing and plotting. I'm not talking about sunny moon weather or ships with sodium bicarbonate racks or a flying suit that has the commands labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow". I do not even bother the issue of the resolutions to the cliffs that conclude each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are thicker than fence posts and do not have cumulative memory. And of the fact that, although the dialogue binds like an express train, the plot goes through the same movements again and again. <br /> <br /> Let's dig it: Commando Cody and his friend are the head of a high-tech hi-tech science lab, tasked with protecting the Earth (or at least the US) from an insidious invasion of aliens . But his office has no security guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So bad guys walk RIGHT and beat carps from Cody and his staff ... not once (maybe understood), but several times. They even kidnap their female assistant to the second attempt. And they will never be more intelligent. To prove more, let me show how Cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around trouble and never seems to succeed in catching anyone. He does this over and over and over. Cody is also flying the ship on the Moon (the woman's assistant comes to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and returns immediately and returns. Cody captures one of the Atomic Ray cannons ... and immediately loses the bad guys again because he could not be bothered to block it. And you would think that if Cody's efforts were so vital to save the US from the moon that he could ask some soldiers with carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of working with the local police . This was supposed to be a military operation, but it behaves like another episode of "Gangbusters." <br /> <br /> Everything is pretty hard to stomach. I appreciate that the creators have been very limited in their story by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonable hombre (even if he loses half of his battles). But I can not help shout "DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when gangsters simply enter his lab or try to explode the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> However, it's okay. Of the three series in the republic I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better plot, and "Kingdom Undersea" had more atmosphere and a hero better than "Radar Men". <br /> <br /> BTW ... why do men "Radar"? They did not use radar, they used Ray atomic weapons. Should not the title be "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Lun?"
