John Heder was absolutely awful in this movie. I felt I was looking at a bad college kid for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good but not horrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton ought to have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving saga in this film (even if it was a poor judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> Overall, I would avoid this at any cost. I'm glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever be stuck in the role of the "baby child", unless he does a serious job on his acting play.
