... from this dreadful movie! There are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, guiding, editing, etc., that it's amazing that something is coming up and proves to be the worst absolute. The music! I have noticed that two composers are mentioned in the film. This must be the reason why every frame has music, the worst "D" movie style. They have never heard of the expression "less is more". I was so painful to listen, I stopped the sound whenever there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You must be sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see roles like that in the twilight of their career. See this at your own risk.
