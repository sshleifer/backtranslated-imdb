A story of an amazing disaster kills "The Psychic" over and over again. Characters and plot are totally uninteresting (as well as the crazy work of Fulci's room, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and any grip of suspense is never found. She is lined to an unbearable extent - to the end, you will not be embarrassed by enthusiasm, but with boredom (and, like me, perhaps an uncontrollable desire to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves to be in a better film. Fulci gorehounds beware - there's not much going on in "The Psychic." 3/10
