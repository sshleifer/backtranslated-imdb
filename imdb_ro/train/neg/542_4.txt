First, there is the Gujarati Theater, then there is Bollywood. Both have their forces and the fans follow. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theater when making a Bollywood production. First he did Aankhen (adapted from a play in Gujarati) - who had a unique plot but could not have a Hindi movie. Now he adapted another piece from Gujarati and called it Waqt - a race against time. In conclusion, emotions are foreign. The development of the plot is not for Hindi movies. For example, role play between father and son is best left at Gujarati Theater - do not bring him into a Hindi movie. Even the comedy piece is best for the Gujarati stage. All the shows are mediums - nothing to shout about - preventing Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is fantastic.
