We started this review with a big giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read on ... here comes, avoid your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is killed here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. This is one of those cheap movies that were thrown together in the middle of the 80s slash era. Despite the heroine killing, this is just a substandard junk. Both priests and students receive bad harm here. They are imagined as oversexed, the sociopathic moron who have too many internal problems to cope with what the college junior campus life looks like ... and the students are even worse off. "Splatter University" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, though I suggest you watching your head cleaner tape, which would be more fun. It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
