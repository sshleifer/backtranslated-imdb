What are we talking about here? I probably saw another movie than you. I was so bored I left the theater. What's up with these stuff. I laughed only once and not even so hard. Anyone who filmed this movie should be taken out on the street and beaten. Usually I always find something I like in a movie, but that's crazy. "Slackers" does "Another Teen's Movie" does not look like a classic. It is classified with such garbage as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of all times. WATCH AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would give people money, while they left the theater as a sign of their apology, but to my dissatisfaction it is not happening. It looks like I will never see this money or the two hours.
