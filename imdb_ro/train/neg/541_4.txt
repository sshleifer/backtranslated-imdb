I found this movie as a strange thing. From the very beginning, it has been extremely difficult for me to like this movie, and now, after thinking a little about it, I can figure out why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him bit (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is bad enough here, and although I can not imagine for my life that would be better, I'm sure someone would could have taken his place quite easily and made this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for bad comedians (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really necessary, directors!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a major British. It just suffers from one thing. Jean-Marc.
