The most positive thing I can say about this production of local "comedy" is that it is harmless. In fact, it is so amazingly gentle that it wonders how many dozens of re-writing commissions has gone through having such a complete removal of personality. It is not full of witchcraft, it is not fun, it is not insidious and it is not charming. It's just a bad, laughless, progress of four losers who have to change their ways - and their attitude towards women - to be allowed to participate in the wedding of their best friend. the local amateur dramatics society, a plot so tired plot that would make 1/43 season "Allo" allo fresh look, and jokes as humorous as watching vegetables putrefaction, the Sione wedding nevertheless scored ten yes 10) nominations in recent NZ movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, someone has seen meaning and won nothing.
