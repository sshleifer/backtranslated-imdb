It would be better consolidated considerably by making it as a 50 minute episode of the outer boundaries. Too much useless stuff and stuff like the worst kind of bad guy that he'd missed the Phantom of the Opera did not help. The entire "Dead of Night" sequence was extremely bad and quite useless. After all, if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins, then I remember exactly who killed all of them again?
