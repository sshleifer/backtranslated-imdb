This film is badly conceived, badly acting and badly written. Jon Heder is terribly annoying and can not escape the same Napolean Dynamite routine. Self-obsessed and ignorant. In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same mother, too obsessed mother, who cares too much and yet not enough for the lives of her children (see As I said so). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally feel like her, is playing a vapid idiot in this movie as well. Jeff Daniels is acceptable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please, skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
