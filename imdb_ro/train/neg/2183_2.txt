This movie was very bad if you considered it a SF movie, like a horror or even a comedy. Everything is ridiculous. The film looks (and is) certainly inexpensive, the actors have no idea what it is, and the script clearly shows that it was done with the filming. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the head was not scary at all - it was quite enough - and they thought they needed something more impressive; they have failed here too (makeup is terrible even for the late 50s, rather funny). The film clearly shows why Joseph Green's director career as such and also as a writer did not materialize; he was very bad at both. The same thing happens to the actors who lead and support. <br /> <br /> "The best brain accomplishment that would not die" is its short running time.
