This movie is quite possibly one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good story. Also, the way the foster parents died was simply ridiculous. Does my mother suddenly die to fall through a shower after falling over a figure of action, and the father is shot by a police officer? I can see where the originality might be, but it could have been better. Also, the kitchen of everything that made me want you to press stop before it's over. After I heard Lucy's name and I realized it was "Lucifer," I wanted to kiss. Yeah, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's the name of a man. It should be given to a male character. On the whole, the movie was a cellar and could have used a better plot.
