Drama / mystery project about the badly written conspiracies about the possibility that AIDS is introduced to the public by the government. Wlaschiha plays a homosexual researcher looking for answers - that in this fogos plot would be hard for anyone to find. Despite the fact that cinema itself is commendable, the camera is hungry for true-to-life characters instead of the superficial, amateur action she unfortunately has to convey. Grade: D +
