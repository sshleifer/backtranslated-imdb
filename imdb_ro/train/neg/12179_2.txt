It's not even worth looking at this sticky spoiler, ruining everything about "Annie". The characters seem to be almost cheap to the badly written story and have a low sense of quality in production. It was very clear for the television, but if I found it on TV, I would move it directly. The children in the movie do a good job, yet the adults who act are incredible and so the movie fails to really attract you. This movie did not have the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly does not shine Annie's whole love. Johnson, because Annie is sometimes annoying and acting ... you can not convince her she's really Annie. The differences in character aspect continued to irritate me throughout the film. Sad to say that this sequel was a total flop.
