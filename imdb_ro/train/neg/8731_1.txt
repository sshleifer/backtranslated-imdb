the lowest possible score is a star? what a shame. I'm really going to lobby for IMDb for the "zero stars" option. to give this movie even a single star gives it too much time. was I the only one who noticed that the microphones were puzzling over the head of the station hopper? and does it work, or should I say its lack? Apparent talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. my elementary school school of my lower school offers a greater range and depth of emotion. and those false Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been ... oh, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it can get.
