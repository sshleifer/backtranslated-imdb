The worst comedy Bob Hope (and this includes a heavy competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud that he is in a bathtub with a geisha girl "pointing his ship". Someone has certainly guided this Hope-hackery above the cliff, having Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida, and still can not make any laugh or excitement. Where's Bing Crosby when you need him?
