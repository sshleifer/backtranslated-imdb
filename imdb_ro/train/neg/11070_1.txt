This was a really bad movie. The character "Cole", played by Michael Moriarty, was the biggest reason he flopped, the actor felt that the adventure of a marvelous South Shooter would make this character worse, he did not. After about 20 minutes I wanted a speech therapist to make an appearance, this would have added sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) wrong action - 2) unsatisfactory characters - 3) /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
