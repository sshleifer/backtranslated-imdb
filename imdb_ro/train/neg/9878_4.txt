It was a lot of love that was put in Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox", unfortunately all love is for himself. It took a long time and effort to make this universe all-encompassing, but if the same time and effort were put into the scenario to try to make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was and this is the best Wes Anderson has come to. The animation is good in the close-up pictures of the animals, however when the room is farther everything gets really harsh in the eye and being perfectly honest looks like a bit of misery. Besides, there was nothing special about the act, Wes choosing to choose his friends and big name for more specialized voice actors who could have made the film better. I'm pretty sure that George Clooney's voice resumes two cameo appearances in South Park, one in which he played a dog. The movie is too smart and too much to try to be intelligent and different, and it is typical, despite the film set in England, all good animals are typical Americans who play baseball, while bad boys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents . I can not emphasize how much time is lost in this movie. I never laughed.
