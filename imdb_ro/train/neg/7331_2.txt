this movie was clearly made stupid and in a hurry. I realize that funding for such films is hard to beat. However, if the plot had any kind of original substance, someone would have seen that it had obtained the necessary funding, that was not the case, and such films are not necessary and have no purpose in their existence. The film for this movie has been done and done better, I could add, several times before. There is no reason to make a movie that is unlikely to compete with others. I was informed by my computer that I needed at least ten lines to send me the comment, so the following lines are just bulls to fill the space. In my opinion, there is no need to talk about this movie. what I said is a lot and if you've lost enough time reading this review, than for God, do not waste your time viewing this movie. The only exception is if you are the type of person who likes to watch horror movies playing at the women's entertainment network at 2:00 a.m. in this case, go on to see what I care.
