I'm a very rude guy, so when I say sexist, they really say he has reduced the presence of the guest female, Dr. Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. despite all the assumed glow and self-control, for nothing more than a big, jealous and unreasonable child. You have really received the plot so far, after his technician, Marvik, also a shattered lover, struggles when he tried to kill Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, from a jealous fury, but he first saw it . (You think he could only get in the room with his eyes closed and merge it on the box, too easily) takes the Enterprise into a non-navigable space outside the galaxy before the boys can submit it. Well, the ship is locked in the limbo, at that moment she could have gone to the lady doctor-liaison and discussed it. Spock must make a deal with Medusan, so we can get home. I mean like a bunch of sugar, do you want to stay deep until we're out of supplies and we die? But the real-looking Star Trek lady is a jealous monster who cries and waves when the idea is hidden, even when her idol Medusan tells her to shut up and go with them. So, the pot of prey mixes with the Associated Spock, making him forget to put his viewfinder, which makes Spock become mad. Kirk, of course, realized what a total disarray was, and was about to fix Spock with her superior telepathic powers. Of course, at the end, Madam and Medusan leave and everything is forgiven. You almost want the President of Battle Star Galactica to appear to take the witch out of a ventilation room for her destructive waterfalls. But in the country of Star Trek, ladies are allowed to be totally unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time it is supposed that there is sexual equality. This is the sexist.
