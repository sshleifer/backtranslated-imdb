Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. It's kind of bad showman that can make you feel bad ... Very embarrassing. Nacho had made some commercials on TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul McCarney around Madrid (the ad was about a McCarney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This small movie is like a Nacho commercial: bad story, bad and terrible performance directions. I can not believe a disgusting film like this was in the Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... Nacho was able to make this film because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with businessmen in Spain.
