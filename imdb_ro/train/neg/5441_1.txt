Of all the movies I've seen, it, The Rage, must be one of the worst. Direction, logic, continuity, changes in script, and dialogue have made me cry in pain. "How can someone come up with something so stupid?" Gary Busey is known for his films "B", but this is a safe movie "W". (W = waste). Take for example: About two dozen FBI officers and local officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagon. Inside the jeep is the MA and is "confused" why all the cops are. In a few seconds he fights with huge weapons, MA being killed directly. The cops go to the jeep with the gary and the company sheds on them. Politicians fall as a domino, and the jeep with Gary revolves in circles and is not hit by a single bullet / pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to have not noticed - damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter had 300 bullets was such a miracle.
