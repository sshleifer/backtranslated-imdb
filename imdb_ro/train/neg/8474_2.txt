The opening scenes move as fluid as the ice cream velvet. Trying to make a dramatic dialogue makes me want to have better control over the quick control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent creatures or disgusting manga. This vampire tries to seduce her prey by mimicking a lost puppy. I usually thank a number of bodies, so there is a cat (who does not matter), a girl, a girl who fell from heaven with a sword in it (no matter what) and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for the use of celina to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the bite sound in an apple for a vampire to bite a victim is simply stupid. I liked Warlock, but the movie was so bad we turned it off and it was so much forgot that we rented it a year later just to stop it again.
