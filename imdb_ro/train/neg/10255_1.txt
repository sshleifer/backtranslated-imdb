Christopher Lee has huge computers in the 1970s that make Teletype noises, as a letter appears on the screen, it has radioactive isotopes that not only shine in the dark but give noisy pulses, they have volcanoes! wicked foreigners disguised as nuns! tide waves! earthquakes! cars explode! explode coffee machines! and as a climax, the whole planet blows up. How on Earth did this movie be so incredible, wonderful DULL?
