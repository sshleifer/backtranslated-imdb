Three "horror" movies with a guy in a recessed house, begging the viewer not to go "there" and (unfortunately) gives us three stories to prove why. The first story involves a young couple in a car accident that meets two psychos. This leads to two predictable total twists. However, it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well done and well done. Predictable but pleasant. The second involves a man on the run after he stole a large sum of money. His car breaks, is attacked by a dog and dows in a nearby clinic. Very obvious, bad done and extremely slow. Even at 30 minutes this is too long. But acting well. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It involves a beautiful and alone woman who is looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a beautiful erotic feel and a beautiful sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even terrific. Very stupid. <br /> <br /> First, the first is worth watching, but that's it. Give them for that, then turn it off.
