It's 1978, and obviously there are too many black team players! The fans will be upset and surely the 75,000 seats will be full, just less happy is that there are so many black players on the pitch! This made for the TV Super Bowl is being watched. There is not much more, but it is really surprising to have talented actors cast for (time), most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, any kind of goodness that Selleck brings to the screen is quickly defeated by "actors" like Dick Butkus. It's a silly story about super bowl bets. PJ Jackson is charged with "New York" (read the mafia) to ensure that the game ends in their favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is pretty innocent and seems to have a poor deal by buying a few people here and there. But things seem to fall for him. Another person, Lainie neassumata, deals. For a while, the mystery of the murders is not known for sure, but it is quite clear to the final crime that Lainie is the new antagonist. It's a bad movie, but it can be watched. The act is decent, and the filming is OK. At least there have not been a dozen typical cars of 70 years (they are not here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotypes and the cocaine era and you will survive. 2/10 (maybe a value of 2.5)
