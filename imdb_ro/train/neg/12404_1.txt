I have to say that this movie is a Mork and Mindy knocks off, when I watch him chills, I even drank. When that guy with the spiders on my throat started to hit people, I was as if, my lord, Asian people smell and suck, because they eat dogs all the time. Any way to Chuck had somewhat terrible performance and did not have the intelligence of an ordinary non-robotic human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of the Christmas past. This movie is so bad that I put my new baby born in a box and left it in Mr. Norris' mailbox. He can raise my baby. I'm not letting him enter a world where he thinks Chuck Norris is a karate expert. Let him see how that real-life hack is for the rest of his life.
