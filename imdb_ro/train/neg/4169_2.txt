I gave her a second only because Natassia Malthe (as Quintana vampire) seems sooooo sexy in this movie. Of course, there is little logic to this film, but so is most of the sci-fi vampire vampires. The film has tried too much to get away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the entire story not only unreasonable, but ridiculous. There are too many gore and too many scenes that made me feel bad. A good vampire movie should be more sensitive because you do not need to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a man to do what a vampire will do. Some groans or shouts are all that is needed to describe the scene (such as the one when Quintana tries to sexually awaken Rosa, all he needs is just a few groans, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
