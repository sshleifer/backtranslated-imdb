It does not take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head did not do it in network programs. The TV pilot does not go through credits before it's obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something because the plot did not make much sense. On the basis of what came out of miserable misery, a terrorist or a thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The Sweetest Secret Agent of the World, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is to stop him. It may have been more, but do you believe me? it really does not matter anyway. Action films should have action. Suspicious moments should have suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. None of this appears in the Code Name: Diamond Head. Have I seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this for snoozer TV? and it's better than any description with a word they can come up with. None of the characters is a little interesting or worth taking care of. And Roy Thinnes is doing for the worst imaginary leaderships. His charisma is just a bit north of a beak. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has, but unfortunately, for anyone else involved, does not seem to be returning as a casting member. Now, if McShane was cast in the show, then he might have something. We quickly discover that these horrible Gawd movies for television make the great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny from Mike and Bots. So while I can only give the 3/10 movie, I'm evaluating episode # 608 to 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
