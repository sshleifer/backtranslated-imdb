This spinning movie looks more like a combination of MTV music videos than a real movie. There's no real story, and as the movie goes on, you're wondering, "What's going to happen?"; but nothing happens. The story of Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people seem to have nothing in common: then why did we get them in a movie. With music you can make the worst movie. When I open the tap and comes water with Bach's music, then most people will want to look at it, but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a scenario for a movie of 100 minutes or more before he starts filming a movie.
