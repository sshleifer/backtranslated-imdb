The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Human to man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pyramids and taking them to Scotland and then realizing that they are not animals or submarines, but actually equal to themselves. The problem is the role of the film's pyramids - two people kidnapped, treated like animals and yet having such a superficial, stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapper (the British anthropologist) ends up being the movie hero for "succeeding" to relate to pyramids ... No idea of ​​how the two hostages feel, from their point of view, about their attempt ... It seems to me to be a superficial film with a fundamental racist perspective ... it never manages to depart from the vision of "white men"
