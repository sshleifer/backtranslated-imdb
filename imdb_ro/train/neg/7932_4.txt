Oh dear! What a disappointment. I've been watching the old West on British television for decades, and I was not aware of it until I showed it yesterday - most of the other Scott Westerns come around for a few years, and it's usually worth looking again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I felt like stopping him, and finally, I did halfway there, something I did not do at all. Scott seemed unusually fat in the charm of the girls, his two brothers were annoying, and so did the Mexican boyfriend. And I have the feeling that the army uniforms have been too modern for 20 years, not that this has disturbed the decision makers of many other Western countries. It may have improved in the second half, but I have not been disturbed to wait and see.
