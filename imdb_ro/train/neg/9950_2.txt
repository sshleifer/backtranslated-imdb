If the idea of ​​the original casting has been preserved (Rutger hunt, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to come to the picture (literally) and confuse it. Predominant black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they changed the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. The approach of Ernest Dickerson's news room to "targeting" only confirmed that this was another affirmative action mission. Master shot, almost, almost. Gads, "Who is the line is anyway," even uses more creative creative work on the camera. Eric's re-writing of "The Most Dangerous Game" is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but it does not give us any reason why the characters do that. We are never given the reasons other than "no one will miss these people," why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things. In addition to John McGinley's heart-felt performance and Charles Dutton's fair job, do not bother with that. A little bit of trivia, there was a real accident during the shooting, which hurt F. Murray Abraham, and led to the death of the young poisoned drivers who caused the accident.
