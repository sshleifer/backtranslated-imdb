The Cold Blood movie was one of the 60s that created a new vision of Hollywood film industry violence. Capote invented the phrase "the nonfictional novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was taken over in the film script he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we were good at the color movie age, Richard Brooks chose to present this black and white film to highlight both the starkness of the landscape and the disorder of the story. This is the first problem with the TV remake - the color changes the tone of the story. In addition, shutting down a movie for a TV reduces the options for how the photos are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clashes that make the second part of the original movie (police, trial, prison, and execution interviews) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it's just another version of laws and orders. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Scenario Searchs it continuously in films that have been successful in another era. Usually, this is a mistake, and this is no exception. All actors are competent. The script is OK. Direction is not in the way. Only the movie does not work as well as the original precision instrument. It does not attract the spectator in ambivalence to Smith and Hickock, which provokes the original movie. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling: "He smiles, who cares?" See the first original on a larger screen, then you can see the TV version simply to understand why the first was such an important film in 1967. It would not hurt to also go on the line and read a little about Capote and the original book. It will help you understand the tremendous effort you put into the material and also some of the controversy surrounding the book and the movie. In fact, I only gave a 4 because I save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs - the one that annoys you about being overwhelmed to spend it
