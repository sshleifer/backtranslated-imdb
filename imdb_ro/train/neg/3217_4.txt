A missed train. A wrong phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not give it a thought as it absorbs in its own thoughts and actions. "Happenstance" tells the story of interrelations and the cause and effect of the world, as it refers to a group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with dysfunctional and disillusioned discourse. There is a deceiving husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic goblin, a pocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as a protagonist in the past (in the sense that she is in the room as much as anyone else and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl who does not seem to find the right pace in her life. <br /> <br /> Learn at the beginning of the day from a stranger on a train, what the horoscope looks for her. What happens to her during the day is told by different characters. Is Prediction Done? The concept is good, but the story is thin. Connections from one event to another are poor. There is a better story in 15 seconds of commercial commercial Liberty Mutual, in which a person sees a good deed and passes to another than two hours of Happenstance. If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you can certainly sacrifice the time for this film, but you will end up disconcerting and wonder what might be the same story if it was treated by a better producer and director.
