After reading the novel before seeing this film, I was very disappointed with the wood act and the arrogance of the producers in their flagrant ignorance of the plot. I think this film does not reflect the brilliance of Bronte's work in any way, and rather it gave the impression of a superficial love story. In the condensation of the film over a short period of 2 hours, the film lost many of the key features that make the book comprehensible and progressive, resulting in a somewhat pathetic plot with little earth. There's no story about romanticism between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this looks pretty bleak and groundless because the two characters have so rare a interaction that you can not imagine that their "love" is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel, you do not get any impression of Jane's cheek and boldness that attracts Rochester, and his arrogance that attracts Jane. Despite the slightest script, I think some of the characters were portrayed very carefully, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall production was poor. Considering a better scenario, the movie would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for remarkable production.
