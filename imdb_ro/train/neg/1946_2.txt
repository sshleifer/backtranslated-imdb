As the mother of two young children who are or should say they have grown up with Scooby's many reincarnations, I feel well positioned to comment on Scooby's current and current version. If as a family we did not see any episode before Shaggy and Scooby gets a clue that we enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special of cartoon Saturday morning. But in essence, the problem is in the current form, so easy that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and gang. I'm sure he can succeed in a quick recovery, but I'm sure the long-term buy-in of elders and young people is in great danger of being lost. My 6-year-old son saw a new version was really dissatisfied and without any encouragement he said he looked very animated and why was not something like the last series (Where are you). Doo was an anomaly, but infinitely better than that. We hope to give a clue about the producers.
