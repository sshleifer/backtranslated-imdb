He has to agree with the other evaluator. This must be the best movie, not to mention the western I've ever seen. Terrible action, a dialogue that was not imaginary and pathetic (let alone absolutely inadequate for supposedly being in 1800) and oh, did we mention a battery pack visible on the back of one of the characters? We were expecting mike to walk in the middle of a scene. And the end? At least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely terrible. And yes, it contained every scrawl in the book, from slow walk on the dusty, empty road to the amazing movie "Let's Remember When" when a main character dies. Fortunately I saw this on the free TV. Do not waste time.
