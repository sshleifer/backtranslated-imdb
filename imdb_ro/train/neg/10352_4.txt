I recently learned that Madeleine L'Engle's novel was turned into a Disney television movie and ordered the DVD. The book was a favorite of me when I was a kid and I read it several times. Despite the fact that some of the child's actors do not resemble the characters described in the novel, the Murry family is well distributed, with a nice Meg (if it's too beautiful) Meg in the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a wonderful child without becoming irritating. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is quite promising, doing a good job in establishing relationships between driving characters and setting the stage. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to reveal itself, and once the children leave the earth, everything is breaking apart. Alfred Woodward is too young and too royal, as Mrs. Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright in exchange) and Kate Nelligan face a mask so inexpressive that she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, they do the lady who looks like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when it should have resembled a benign Western witch. effects and direction of art. I understand this is a TV movie, but CGI seemed something that could have been done 15 years ago. Mrs. Whatsits "centaur incarnation is a disaster, like the Chewbacca costume for aunt aunt, who in the novel is a velvety and elegant creature instead of the big foot work shown here. I could go anywhere, almost any artistic choice is a disaster, probably because it was not a big enough budget to do this justice, but also because the design work has no imagination and good judgment. It ought to have needed the sense of miracle that Spielberg brought to the first His shame that, with the current popularity of adapting the series of children's literary fantasy, no one was thinking of adapting a Wrinkle in Time and is a continuation of the big screen, giving him the sphere of action he deserves.
