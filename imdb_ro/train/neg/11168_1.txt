- A Mexican priest becomes a fighter to save an orphanage or something - I went to see this movie because it was non-WWF fighting and so I thought it might be fun. It was not. It's awful to look at. Embarrassing. Any opportunity for comedy is mercilessly scattered. <br /> <br /> I admit I do not like Jack Black anyway. After that, I brought my brain to think of a good role she did. The only thing I can see is where he is. it was like a foil needed for John Cusack's character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of those bastards who do not have to realize that being idiot is not the same as it would be funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even a stupid thing. It's just irritating. It's not really bad, it's stupid. I've also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if there's anything to do, I'm not rushing to find her on DVD.
