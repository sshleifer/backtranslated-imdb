I just saw this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It is obvious that while the stoogi are stars presented, they do not lead the show. First, they are divided into two groups - Moe, "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there is not much work in the team. The love story that feeds the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones who have any ability to act, there is another group of musical songs that are unpleasant, unless you think their attempts to be amusing are unfortunately hoarse . Music is tiring, drive cars on the farm and then depend on horses, western western wear is bad and there is a bunch of film without any stomach on the room. By the way, this is evident after Curley's first stroke, and the low level of energy is clear. Vernon Dent has recently appeared in an unbelievable role. I liked everything these guys did, including all the things that were not from Curley, but this little dog is pretty stupid.
