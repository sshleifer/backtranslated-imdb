This is really terrible. There are no weighty characters, all floating around it. Motion Capture is a fine toy, but this movie demonstrates that you really need people who know the animation to make an animated movie. The car can not do anything good on its own. If you see it as a bizarre movie, you will be entertaining to find mistakes of continuity ... IN A 3D FILM! It's weird to watch the princess's dress around working with different physicists. You need animators and 3D animators, not the data records you know about 3D programs. Notice junctions, such as elbows, how they lost volume and deformed. The person who made the character design (a very good one) certainly suffered when he saw that they moved because you can not say I come to life.
