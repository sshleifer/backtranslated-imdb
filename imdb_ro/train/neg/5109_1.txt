"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is still a "common sense", the so-called "Heart Heat", and out-of-the-show ratings show that ABC had time to put together. to understand the problems these families face. For that, I'm sorry. But do not you think the introduction of four widescreen plasma TVs, three desktop flat-panel computers, an inground pool that takes half of a yard, and expensive designer cabinets is too much BIT for any family? Sure, these families have gone through many. Sure, they deserve more beautiful things than they had before. But honestly, the things Ty Pennington and his crew have put in these homes are enough to suit a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really bothers me about this show is how you and your crew always have something good to say about every little thing that is about family or family. Telling a wheelchair person that he is "so loud" or "very courageous" really ages after a while. Maybe it sounds rude, but believe me; watch this show and you will see what I mean. Overall, this show is overestimated. If you want to look, go. This comment is just a heads-up for what you were watching.
