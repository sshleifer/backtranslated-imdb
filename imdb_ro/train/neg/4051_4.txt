Lindsay Anderson was largely a European film producer, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker are making spectacular films that include visuals. Anderson's film is more about social commentaries and subtexts, so much so that messages often end up throughout the entire movie, whose main function should be to distract the audience. What are you thinking about when you think about British movies? I am very much in the opinion that cinema should be a universal environment (the best British film is the one who tries to imitate Hollywood in my opinion) if you want to send a message, try out the pony and find the movie , pretentious and too stable in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France. You can imagine that every Frenchman loves this film, especially the climax. New filmmakers in France will admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but a mass international will not like it, and many will not dislike it
