The bad movie does not offer anything new. Common snips and jams try to make for a strange, but thin story. The action is just pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed up for this is someone guessing. Owen Wilson really turns into one of the worst performances in recent horror film history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to look at and not much, though Lili Tayor has done a job above average. The special effects were quite memorable, and the house itself was breathtaking and gorgeous. However, they can not make makeup for the bad act and for the story that seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Not disturb.
