The story was fine. Akshay Kumar was good as always, and this was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor was sorry. It was so harsh and wept over her zero size, but she did not look much weaker. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor has accepted such a bad role. There was nothing to do for him in the movie. Just because it's a Yashraj movie does not mean an actor should accept the role, however bad it is. Said Ali Khan was fine. I think it's time for Indian directors and producers to start thinking about Indian customers as a smart batch. What are we? stupid !!!! What they think will show 2 men to take a SWAT team to the teeters and we will believe them. Indian police are so bad that they're trying to find some criminals ... they've got a whole team of 100-person cops and nobody was there to surround the palace. The action was silly and I have never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was in a circle of 30-40 cops who shot him ... ... and shot back to them. No bullet of the cop touched him, but he killed all the cops. Shit. CARP. I think the fight director who was thinking about this scene should retire. We strongly recommend that you do not see this movie.
