What a terrible movie. I like monster blows, but I could not even look at half the terrible characters, cardboard and special abisal effects. There is nothing to redeem about this movie. Characters come from an endless source of suicide fodder or other sock dolls. The land is formic, cut and glued, standard-run-amok drivel science. Even CGI is horrible. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the movie to offer some good candy. There are no surprises here, as old as old. This is really one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hung on a desk so that children can use it as a pinnacle.
