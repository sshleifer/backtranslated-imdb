I just rented because I loved the first movie. However, calling John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a con trick to make you rent it. He is actually an executive producer and clearly has nothing to do with making this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) A tragic story, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing vampire Hunter all the time . It's not even bad comic. What we've done is a boring and non-invasive film, with a terrible scenario and unlimited action of evil and clich√©. It simply has a low budget. Avoid the bubonic plague.
