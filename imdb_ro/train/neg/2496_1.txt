I would list this movie as horror movie. I did this because I'm not aware of a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre comes closest to horror, I decided to put it in this category. The act was amateur. You know who the villains are at the first scene. Heroin is just as ugly as the movie. Film-makers should take this film as an example for a lesson not to do in a movie. It's so bad. Man bad word is an understatement. The villains smuggle an ocean tank and want ten million dollars. They want the money to be delivered on an island of roses inhabited in the middle of the Pacific. He would have laid ducks after they'd get the money. There is no escape plan. How stupid. The female cruise director is a former cop, sailor seal, kung fu I'm scared. The hilarious part is how it deflects the clock bomb. He says he knows what he's doing and he's still pulling all the threads one by one. Then put it in your pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. He's crazy? Like crazy people who have watched this HIDDEN. If you have a M-L that you do not like. Annoy you to rent this movie and pretend to enjoy yourself. I assure you that he will tell you to your husband that you have such a taste and that his son / daughter has married a person under the family standard.
