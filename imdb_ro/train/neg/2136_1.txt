Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful movie that attacked Republicans? Why not learn. Dixie chickens do not. These Leftists live in their own elite bubbles that interact with each other; moving to the fact that most of America is much more in law than they are. The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are seldom political. Dan Akroyd Cheney's anthem was bad. I would have thought Cussack could have landed on better movies. It was not funny.
