May contain spoilers. I'm saying this, but anyone who is good enough to read this, can figure out every plot on the right. I liked. I did not hate some of the movies that offend your intelligence, but it felt too predictable when it came to the happy ending. There were funny bits along the way to be sure, but few were original. At least he did not go for the gutter. Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck is working hard. Their scenes together are actually the only redeemed feature. Everyone else has a cardboard cut, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done this as a favor for somebody. Overall, it's a safe, but not inspiring, 90-minute game.
