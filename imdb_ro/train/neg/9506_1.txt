Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the tip. It was said earlier, that's what you get when half of the crew has fallen asleep at work, unfortunately, half the game did. Do not get me wrong, it's fun, but you're tired of mashing buttons. As for the summary of the plot, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. You beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who does this by itself?
