For strange reasons, the world of the film is fashion driven. Someone is making a movie about a shark, then suddenly the oceans of the film world are filled with giant Squids, killer octopuses, and sea monsters of each ilk. A man is pursued by a hell hell boyfriend, then each movie character is chased by a hell policeman or by a hellfriend from Hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company produces a big budget blockbuster for FX tornado, then other filmmakers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they do not have the budget to shoot it does not stop them. NIGHT TWISTERS is a case. What hit me for the movie is that it is trying to hide its lack of budget by cutting off ad breaks. Every time there is a tornado, the pantry is blocked by the horrified expression of the actors, while shouting things such as "Oh, I said I was going this way" and "Flee for your lives," then the screen fades in black, the budget for special effects. Unfortunately, the NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been exalted to include better actors. Distribution is not bad at all, but they are not impressive and do not have the talent to wear a character-driven movie. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? And the last word about it being a TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had improved for several months as the summer blockbuster in 1996, and NOTT has a feeling full of feelings, which makes me believe it was made and released to connect with the hype surrounding TWISTER
