This was one of the brightest movies I have watched in recent months, with a predictable plot and a rather bad action (mainly from support characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually much more satisfying than the movie itself ... Hugh Laurie has made a lot of effort to learn how to dance Samba, sinking to the deserted end of the pool. The film is based on the appearance of a wonderful girl and wonderful music, but they are not enough to do good entertainment. If you have never seen Rio or the inside of a British bank, this movie is For You. 2 out of 10.
