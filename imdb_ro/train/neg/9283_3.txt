I do not know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I am a great fan of vonnegut and I am very familiar with the story of the original Showtime film that bastarded beyond faith, but even if I was not, the poor act, the very poor casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, athletic and around the individual, Harrison , the type is completely generic!), and writing the substandard made this type unattainable. Somebody pointed out how cute Maculay Culkin's line was. If you read this and thought it was a pure comic glow (unfortunately it was probably the most intense part of the movie), maybe you like this movie. But if you are a Vonnegut fan or you are not completely crazy, you do not see him. Please.
