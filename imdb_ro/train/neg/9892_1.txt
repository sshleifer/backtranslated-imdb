Why is every film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh, revealing the worst film to make? No matter what attraction the woman had for her greatest, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, do not seem to meet on the screen as anything other than the antics of those who have finished high school sex. In spite of generous sets and costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian "sandals and toga" extravaganza in the 1950s. Of course, this kind of spectacle belongs to the big screen, which is why the "Gladiator" did well, but "Gladiator" did not have the romantic novel. Miss Varela has a little acting talent like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has spare talent. Too bad that some of them did not wash the others.
