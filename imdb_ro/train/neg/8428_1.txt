Despite mysterious positive reviews and high ratings, this is a terrible film. Pretty great, I feel compelled to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the final period of the Raj during India's fight for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist at that time. For example, the young hinduist young man in the local village has an affair with the British English captain married, knowing very well that discovering the business would probably mean total social shyness and shame if not a mortal punishment? It's unlikely, but maybe. However, the same young housemid, in India's conservative society of that era, continues to unfold as a half naked Britney Spears in heat, engages in outdoor sex during the day in open presence where it could be discovered at any time? That's not just a little bloody, it's a delayed plot line. Such idiots, combined with the weak ones, led me to leave the cinema an hour in the movie, so I did not see the second half of the movie. We can only hope that the end is more intelligent than what we saw in the first half of the year.
