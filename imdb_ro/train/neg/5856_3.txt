T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s but seems to be a director who can not mature with changing times, styles and fashion. It's like having the same style of old-fashioned shooting. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad or good. Anil Kapoor generally convinces the two roles of his father and his son, but the wrong scenario often makes it fun and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - it's always good, and here's nothing but that. She does the best of what she gives her, but she always does that. In conclusion, nothing wonderful. Raveena is OK, which means normal, not bad, not good, nothing. This movie is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Maybe it's a late film? Well, even then it would still be standard. The script is terrible, the movie is overwhelmed and the story does not go anywhere. It feels like a movie made in the early 1990s, but the script makes you look even older, the style is similar to the one of the 1950s. We do not recommend you, unless you are a big fan of the main actors.
