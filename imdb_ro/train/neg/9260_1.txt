The only connection that this film has against horror is that it is terribly unwavering. I'd rather catch my finger with a rusty nail than having to sit back again. Even for a TV movie is flat. The distribution is boring. The scenario is just as exciting as a bowl of sand. The way that two directors conspired to create such a film will not remain one of the great mysteries of the twentieth century. There is only one vague scene of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in weakness and cut to early pay. If you are tempted to see this, press it, set the alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfort. With any luck, you will do it quickly, and the alarm will awaken you once the worst thing is over. That's the movie.
