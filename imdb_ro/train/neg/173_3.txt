A decent sequel, but does not wrap the original fist. A killer writer (Judd Nelson) assumes new identities to guide his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still a ruthless killing, but the film looks very much in the cheek. Any humor is not funny. The total project seems to have the quality fast and sometimes Nelson is well above the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen ... this should have happened with this script.
