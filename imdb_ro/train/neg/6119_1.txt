Muscle moss in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an expeditionary expeditionary team; the beautiful daughter of the team leader finds her first. A far too rich version of Tarzan's story has a good production but is compromised by the worst direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is inspirational beyond the blurred motion and the closed eyes of Bo Derek's wife's unshakable body; has so much talent behind the room as Ed Wood. Trying for the sexuality of the tongue in front, Derekii do not have a finishing, a pleasant time and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and brave abandon (they are cautious about the winds) but after a promising opening everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have marbled in his mouth all the time) has the title role, but plays the third leg on John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's self-importance. * from ****
