Closer to reality and deeper than "Breakdance," Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a bit boring show. Again, this pic does not really fall into the "breakin" madness, but at least we have a little fun with the plot, which refers to the life of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York . Everyone has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one dj, another an artist who creates "burners," while Little Bro 'Lee is a hot hip hop dancer. Lathan is not capable of generating a real public interest story, though, and his young caste also struggles with their characters. Therefore, it is almost entirely left to funky music and fresh dancing to save the day. The choreography is again sharp for both the club and street scenes, but this is not enough to lift the "Beat Street" at a higher height. Unfortunately, the film collapses late after showing a glimpse of hope that it could become exciting.
