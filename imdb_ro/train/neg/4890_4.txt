A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband Mountie she loves ... but she loves sex too! During the movie, she gets more men in bed - including her husband AND brother! There is also a lesbian sequence (tame). This movie put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I think) the first film appreciated by the critic, X, ever. It was a great success when it came out. Unfortunately, it is not well dated. She is well guided and Erica Gavin is great (no matter what happened to her), and she was VERY colorful ... but today's standards are extremely tame. I'm surprised she has a NC-17 rating now - there's no hardcore sex and only women without peaks and no male nudity at all. It is also (unfortunately) quite boring and the addition of policy at the end was confusing (and quite stupid). It is noteworthy that I saw what was considered very shocking in 1968. It seems that I saw the cut version (which has a rating R), but I heard only a few seconds here and are missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is much better and is VERY GOOD. Grab him in return.
