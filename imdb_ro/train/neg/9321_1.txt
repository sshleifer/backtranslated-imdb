I hired this movie about 4-5 years ago and I was immediately disappointed. I wanted to see a movie on b-movie, but I got into a fecal problem for my eyes. The act was similar to the dry look of the grass. I saw a better action in a softcore movie ... The idea that a crazy killer comes from nowhere has bothered me. How was this horror movie? The value of this movie was ridiculous at best. They were not scared. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The land was everywhere, if any. If you get bored looking for a bad movie to rent, skip it. There are much better b movies out there.
