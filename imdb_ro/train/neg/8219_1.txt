I'm the type of person who always goes 2 to the horror section when I choose a movie, so I chose five eyes, I was disgusted with this movie, and I thought there was no story line and no point, you can enjoy it, made my skin crawl to think people want to watch movies that just encourage violence for the hell out of it was a low budget and very garbage! I think I managed to do better. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and you should not mind to look like the actors were rubbish The room was terrible, the picture was bad and the sound was not at zero, I think it was just like a frightening rupture on the press that projects and did not work at all, was a foul.
