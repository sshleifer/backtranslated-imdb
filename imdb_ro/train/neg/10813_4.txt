The first half of this version was the best I've ever seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. Then it was like someone said "Uh oh, this is too long," and hacked the rest of the story to pieces. Major scenes, when included at all, are considered, combined and set in order to completely change the story. There was so little transition or even development of the scene that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow. The great disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end crushed it.
