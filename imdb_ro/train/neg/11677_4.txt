This was talked about death by critics when honestly it is not so great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same film, with variations of suspense. But I found "CHAOS" more enjoyable because it was fast paced like the silly movie "Swordfish". The reason why this movie is more popular is because it was released in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at foreign film and theater festivals but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the US / > It's true that this movie brings a lot of tribes to classical movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other movies by Spike Lee, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch it if nothing else is on Tv, but you'll probably be bored after a while.
