Heres what I did not like: 1 to the father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were very annoying 3 Dinosaurs (for the most part) looked at the fals 4 The bad scientist and he was annoying < br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the DVD image was very bad <br /> <br /> What I said to her: 1 Jerry Goldsmith's music. This music is really wonderful. I have the soundtrack in this movie.
