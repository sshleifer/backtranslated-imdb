About the worst movie in the cast right now! I like zombie movies and I saw that in the used rack, so I figured why not? Oh, my god is ashamed of zombie movies and fans of the genre! Anyone who made this movie has to put away the video camera and go to the film school! There are so many gore singers who have put time and effort in their films and have something that this film has no dignity. I know what it takes to make movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent doing the meat market, but none of that money and time came to do well. You need actors, a script, a real room, invest in some books on how to make independent movies. I do not know how you got the release of a DVD, but whoever did this is either a very good friend, or he's hitting his head on the wall. In gore films, quality is not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I could not get my money back. Please if you saw this movie write here and end to shlock. I know I'm very harsh, I only had 10 rows, so I'm trying to get it right.
