This movie is horrible. The operation is a trash. No cry, no action, hopeless songs. Although the landscape is great. I always wanted to go to Greece. Anyway, with regard to Saif, you would expect extraordinary performance, but even he left the people down. Akshay Kumar, recognized as a Bollywood ploy and Singh's voice. It was sensational in this movie. For this performance, Filmfare should introduce another prize. The toilet prize for the worst performance. By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat. Kareena Kapoor. First of all, she is not comparable to her sister Karisma. In action, in appearance or in body. Now she wants to prove she's over her. She enters this movie wearing bikinis and short tents and pants. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan lets such a wife dress up. But it probably impressed some people who dress like that. And if you ask how, you think each man has an erection that follows this movie. They dream of having Kareena Kapoor in a naked bed with a condom. Including me. Personally, I think she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it. I'm forced to give him a 1/10, but I would really give this movie 0/10. An unrealized movie.
