I read the Celestine Prophecy book and look forward to seeing the movie. Pay attention to the fact that the movie is freely based on the book. Many of the most interesting points in the book do not even appear in the movie. It's a "B" movie at best. Many events, characters, the way the character interacts and meet in the book are simply changed or do not appear. The flow of events in the book are very smooth, tangled and fed as if you were a child. Character development is very poor. Personal personalizations of characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a horror movement "B". I understand it will take six hours in the movie to present everything in the book, but the game screen has missed many points. Casting was very good.
