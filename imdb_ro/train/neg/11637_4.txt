Uwe Boll made it impossible: to create an adaptation of the game that would remain at least somehow true to the game; he turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a film full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it is a success. Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll that we're dealing with here, so do not expect the movie to be really good. while he has a moment, "Postal" embraces his welcome and becomes a pain to stay inside. In its center, Postal is a satire on the United States, as it was made by a twelve old child. Boll seems to think offense is linearly proportional to comical value: the more offensive, fun and exaggerated, more fun. This results in a movie that sets new levels of insipidity while it is extremely hit and miss. Yeah, some gags do not work, but it seems like luck. Among the high points are the director satirizing, and people are very violently hit by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include .. and pretty much anything else. Once the initial surprise has subsided, Post is simply a cellar to be watched. Yes, there is a good joke in every good ten minutes, but everything consists of the hideous horde of characters shooting and watching each other for what seems to be eternity. have worked as a short film but are not content enough for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as much). There are beautiful ideas and nice attempts, but hopelessly lost in endless and useless scenes of action and content that is offensive only for the sake of 4/10
