I have never read Bradbury's novel about which this film is based, but from what I have gathered will be interesting (when I finally read it and I will do it). My comments will be based exclusively on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I needed to see and I was so excited, but when I'm done, I was so disappointed that he was hurt. This is because the movie itself was so amateur. The actors were not well distributed (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - not just here). The young actors, they seemed, were only asked to show up, to enter into the clothes of the characters, to tell the lines and to make their faces. The set and the props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the horrible thing I was going to go online and check who guided it just to see what kind of work she did. Editing was cut and glued, and the script (script) was so (even if the author was involved, ironically?). The increase in tension, fear and suspension was so slight that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. I read some of the comments about this movie and it seems hard to believe that people really like it. What hurts most is that the content is interesting and fun and interesting. He had so much potential. Unfortunately, the movie was so technically bad that it took away the brilliance of the story.
