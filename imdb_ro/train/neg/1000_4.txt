The land of descent, if it can really be called a plot, has two events worth noting. One from the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events account for about 5% of the total time of the movie. Everything (and I mean _everything_) between them is, in principle, desperate for the director to complete the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I do not mind the scenes - but if you expect to stay at 60 minutes of cloudy / dark scenes (literally), with no story you have another thing that comes. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is completely wasted here. And no, she does not get, even in the NC-17 naked version I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to look down, take a nap in exchange - probably you will have more dreams more interesting.
