I saw this obvious fest at a video store. And before my first VCR first I thought that I would baptize this little gem and bad film will be the best! The dialogue is unfortunately hilarious. And it contains a cloak with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And like Christopher Walken seemed willing to live every bad film in recent years. This movie is Mr Quinn's bear. <br /> <br /> It has lines like: "Shut up and let me fight!" And "Do you mean a lot of sh_it!" <br /> <br /> and return priceless: "Unfortunately, it is sh_it, angry sh_it hard!" <br /> <br /> You will be stunned by a scene Bo is a SOMMERSAULT fight like a pool table! and make a nice kung fu hit when it comes to roll! Chop Socky action and emotion T and a !!! <br /> <br /> What movie fan would schlock He could ask for more? and when character Mr. Quinn suicide and returns to haunt Bo as a ghost asks him why he committed suicide rather than deal with the disease's debilitating? He says: "real men do not eat quiche. "Oh, yes. If Bo was a smart cookie, she would be called an exorcist right then and there!
