I first learned about Wendigo a few years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's books on the story "Scary Stories": after this story, Wendigo - after you call yourself in the wind - pulls you along and pulls you to the sky and spray you. Although it sounds like a rather bizarre idea, Schwartz's story turned it into a rather coherent idea. "Wendigo" does not do it. It essentially consists of any horror clich√©: the family moves to a new home and strange things start to happen, whoever is hurting them asks for it, and everyone should better listen to the old Indian. I have seen these things so many times that I do not bother to count. Anyway, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the middle") did much better than that.
