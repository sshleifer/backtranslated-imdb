Good. Look, I saw LOTS and I mean LOTS from these types of movies. You know, those in which the DVD cover looks so good and scaarrryyy that you just can not WAIT see it? I took it again. And I feel pretty tired. But I can handle it. It's pretty simple. Sucking (I know, rather minor) but did it. And I agree with the other poster that if we had to stand by the dull things, why oh, why did the lead actress be so unattractive? Fun, if I add. And the perversion she used to convey unsolved pain / grief over her daughter's death did not help too much. I mean, Jesus ... Oh, but it was just clean ...
