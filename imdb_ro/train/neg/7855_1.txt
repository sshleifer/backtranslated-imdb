I could not believe my eyes once I watched this movie. There is no point in blood and violence. Unlike other frightening films that had a gore and meaning for him, this film is just blood, gore and killing one after another. This movie is not at all interesting, has no significant plot or story line, nor does it have any intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this global movie is useless. Do not waste your time with this. It's just an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not frightening, but simply riots. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever watched from all the horror films I've ever seen.
