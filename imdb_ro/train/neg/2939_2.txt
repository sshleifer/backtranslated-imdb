As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or a response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should remain singing ... not that he is a terrible actor. Only this film is extinguished. The first 25 minutes were fine - a beautiful family movie, as it was - but then it's nothing but a dull digging. <br /> <br /> If a singer plays properly, Pavarotti, like Giorgio Fini, loses his voice a few times, and Dr. Pamela Taylor (Kathryn Harrold) comes to rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor falls slowly for the singer, the two are asking all the time and continues and continues and continues. Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It's Harrold who ruins things and after watching her here I'm not surprised he did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is beautiful scenery in the movie to enjoy, good photos of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I'm bored and I do not remember much about the second half of it.
