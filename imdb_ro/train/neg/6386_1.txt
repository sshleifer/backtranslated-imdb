I really wanted to like this movie, but it was impossible. The act was extremely hammered, the plot was annoying, and the rhythm was slow, so slowly. In the meantime sitting in the theater, I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minutes in the movie and I pray for an end. Of course some of the pictures were beautiful, but guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a typical magic adjustment instrument, it was not much to talk about music. The music there was annoying and boring. Strong and powerful sounds, sometimes, were also annoying. Mainly, this movie managed to bore me and sneak at the same time. I'm glad it's over. I have to go see "Tideland" and wash my mouth out of my mouth.
