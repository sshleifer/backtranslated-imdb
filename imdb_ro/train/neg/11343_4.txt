He watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Love and non-spectacular supposed continuation of the classic animation "101 Dalmatian". Yes, the movie continues where it's over, but the problem is that it's the same as the original. One of the great things about the original was the rhythm of the story, which it does not have. Animation is also very non-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same character that goes through the same story again. When Disney stops bothering us with sequels and repetitions, etc. Probably when we renounce the rent or purchase of this mediocre charge they have been withdrawn.
