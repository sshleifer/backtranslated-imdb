"Shinobi" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing on a character automatically brings a sense of gravity or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, in order for the public to look after the people who die, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially composed when you have tons of characters, all die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can not bother to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least READ the reason why I die plausible, right? Not. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with no part of knowing why they are fighting each other. They kill each other, for the emperor says so. However, even after it became clear that the Emperor wanted everyone else to be dead, he still refused to abandon his mistaken missions. That's not stubborn ... it's simply stupid. Good good! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide reasonable reason for the fight. At least they will die by fighting in cold action scenes, right? However, NO! In fact, many of the struggles do not even fight: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort, introducing suddenly (and, in my opinion, miserable). I'm talking about things like: "Lalala, I walked along and my throat was cut off." END for this character. Not even in the middle of the movie, I threw my hands in frustration to ridicule.
