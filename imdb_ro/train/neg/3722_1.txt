I remember being forced (yes - literally forced) to see this movie by a Southern Baptist preacher when I was a child and even then I loved the terrible. It is designed to scare away that poor brothers are "saved." The only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and I could get out and have a real life. Visit the chapter about this film in Sarah Diamond's book "Christian Right Policy." FASCINANT. And certainly more exciting than the movie!
