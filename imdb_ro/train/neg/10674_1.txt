This is one of the worst movies I have seen over the years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the act is actually embarrassing. Was not Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely unlikely. The sin is so bad, it is worth mentioning. I mean, who even thinks about makeup in a contemporary film. Someone should tell the make-up artist and the DOP that you should not see it. Conclusion is a massive disappointment - in the sense "and then realized that everything is a dream" Do not waste your time or money. You better look in space for 2 hours.
