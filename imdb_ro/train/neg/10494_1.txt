At Steve Irwin's show, he's hilarious. He does not even try to be funny and he's just, but his movie was not exactly what I would call a movie - I mean when the guy on his car is trying to kill him just say, "Oh, that's ugly type!' and looking straight into the room He put his face in the room too And when the guy breaks out of the car, do not you expect him to be dead? Terri had the worst act I've ever seen! when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says "Steve." He did not sound scared or anything else, it was just "Steve." I mean, I hate to say, but it's not worth seeing I love Steve Irwin but his movie was too dumbass.
