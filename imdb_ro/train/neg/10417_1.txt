This movie would have been a * big * silent. The actor is really good, at least in a Look at Ma, Doing Big Big Act! a sort of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is huge. Each line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED by human tragedy! <br /> <br /> For the most part, I felt like gagging. Still, like any wreck of the train, I could not destroy my eyes. This dialogue could have worked on the stage, though I doubt it. On screen, it was crowded, haphazard, hackneyed and almost any other stereotypical negative adjective you can find to describe a very dramatic drama. If you enjoy the giant melodrama, you could enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, though. For all of these melodies, this is sure to happen at their own pace. This scenario must have sounded very differently when the actors involved read it themselves. It simply does not work once they have arrived in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB makes us a big drawback sometimes when using the weighted computer controlled score. The curse of the hungry class is worth less than 1. Characters based on characters are wonderful, but when you develop your characters simply by pushing them through circles without plausible explanations for maturity or evolution, it's not character development! Your characters must have some motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * developing the character. This is a plot plot. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or, at least, watch it off. You may get a fun from all arm-waving characters do. Oh, and the wise word - to prove that this is really an artistic movie, you see James Woods in all "I do not like to say" you were not warned.
