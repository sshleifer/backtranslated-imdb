THE LAMPON'S NATIONAL CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. He did not spend much time in the theaters of my big city. Why? Because he is stupid !!!!! It's not bad in a good, but bad way in a really painfully unfortunate way. The whole cast of actors was largely unknown and unknown after this turkey. The idea is actually excellent (a parody of blows of weakness), but the execution is very devoid of any aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is far more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing shortcoming.
