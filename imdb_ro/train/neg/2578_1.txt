To summarize this movie: Without a real plot, this movie is made up of 80 minutes of disturbing characters, whether to drink or to make bad jokes. Music is terrible, humor is not funny and all foolish female slutty or total geeks. It seems to me that the movie was written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks drinking is cold, women are designed to like men, and everything that opposes this view is geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with original American Pie movies, other than a few names, Levenstein, who is a minor character in this regard. The only good thing about this movie is beautiful girls. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by the rating of 5.4 because it obviously overestimated and does not deserve anything greater than 2.
