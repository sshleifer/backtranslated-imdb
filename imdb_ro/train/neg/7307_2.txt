This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in this are completely random and do not make any sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so bad that it can fall with a case of fever on the cabin (I AM SORRIE). I describe it as a scratch that has been filled with a newspaper, because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. Kevin, for example, the loving child of karate that I love, is strangely strange to himself, then is the cop who is a little weird and perverted, then the drug addict, then there is the fact that he attacks a casual type who clearly needs help. then suddenly the main character is having sex with his friend's girlfriend just because he's saying something stupid about a falling plane. then finally a good old family racism, followed by a rabbit operating Kevin Karate child. In fact, it's pretty clever that I can use racism as a joke in this movie. There's no reason for anyone to enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even if I did not make this movie. Hate is a powerful word, but seeing it is the only word I have allowed to use it will have to do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
