Followed on Hulu (too many commercials!), So he broke the pacing, but even so, it was like watching a very bad movie from the early 1960s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both sides are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest against the portrayal of all men as venal and of all women as sharks. They cheated on live video for Western sales and used a lot of Western models so men could touch them. I usually enjoy Indian movies, but that was a great disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not happen in India (Uncle continues to refer when Mac is back to India), but they can not find out where it should happen.
