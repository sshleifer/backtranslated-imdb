... or maybe it's just that bad. The plot is a cheap rebalancing of the premium, which is odd, because it should be a prequel, not a continuation. Pretty much, the whole movie seems to be a cheap remake of the first one, the scenes imitating the things that took place in the first, just much more ridiculous and unlikely. If the former had a large distribution, it is made up of actors in list B and rejects it. The act is mostly terribly bad. Half of the good lines in the film are taken directly from the first, as almost every major character, including those who were not in the first film. I realize that this was done by a serial TV pilot, but that's not an excuse. They did not have to turn the images (bad) into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that's erotic sequences. However, since they are by no means as good as the first ones, even this does not raise it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you are a direct guy, it might be worth checking if you want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
