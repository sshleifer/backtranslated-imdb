After seeing KHAKEE, I felt I was going to look at another good movie, but unfortunately the film is a joke and actually tries to introduce Aryeman. After Keshu's father is the producer, RKS spoke both about the film during the promotions, saying that the film has meat, unlike the movies released at that time, I wonder what the movies are talking about The film is actually a typical Masala movie with a lot of comedies, romanticism, > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> to which children kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts ever, Imagine the kidnapped children of Dawood's family The end is a complete mumble of sudden change of characterization RKS offers the weakest film up at present, except for scenes from Bachchan, the movie is a piece of music <br /> <br /> Music is boring Amitabh tries to plays the part, although it is not the best, although it counters too much when it pulls a trigger and makes a strange look while smoking the cigar H is dubbing too is not properly matched at times <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and hams Aryeman seems expressionless, trying too hard but exaggerated in some scenes <br /> <br/> Bhumika comes out of the best of lot <br /> <br /> The rest are fine
