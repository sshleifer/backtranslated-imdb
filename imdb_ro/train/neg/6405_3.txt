No real plot for it, just a series of short tricks that act after very old jokes. I chucked once or twice at the beginning, very much to beat my head. But even at just 73 minutes this movie is welcome before too long and becomes eternal and tiring (with nudity sprinkled here and there to keep you awake). Even as bad as this movie is (and it's pretty rotten), it's a comedy gem, compared to quite a bit by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg (Data, Epic, Meet the Spartans) Also, the song is unfortunately sad. <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: 11 pairs of tits, 3 shrubs, 3 cribs <br /> <br /> My degree: D Red DVD Extract: Original trailer for this movie; and the trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "Farmer", "Obsessed", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor", "Wacky Taxi"
