I will admit that I did not give too much a chance to this movie. I decided pretty soon that this movie was not just my movie. For the most part, she has an excellent look at cinema. The scenes in Manhattan from the early 1970s look very good, like the lead actress. It is a very clear black and white that could almost make the film feel uncomfortable and fresh. However, some of the other techniques that filmmakers use shoot that perspective in hell. Separate editing is very late in the '60s, somewhere between surrealism and the new wave. The story feels like it comes from a very specific moment, somewhere between the idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. The movie follows a young girl around the city when she searches for a man whom she has anonymously sex with. While she meets other strange characters, she reveals her strange characters and reveals them. The film seems to be a comedy outside the wall, irrelevant, but adds an avant-garde sensation. I was expecting you if you love Andy Warhol's movies, you'll be very excited to find the phone book. Some of the problems I had: Near the end of the movie, a character says an anecdote that lives over twelve minutes - brutal to stay through. There is also a very explicit animation sequence that I found brutal and juvenile that serves as the climax of the movie. I laughed loudly four or five times and liked the end (minus the disgusting animation). And when the movie turned out to be dark for the final nightclub sequence, I liked what it looked like better. It has come to be one of those experiences in which I felt I would have liked it very much if it were a little different. But that's what the producers gave us. It's obscure, artistic, and left-handed on the dial, but none of these are reasons to recommend it on your own. I did not think it was unique or creative so demanding and demanding.
