This is probably the most boring, worst and useless movie I've ever seen last year. The parcel that would have some philosophical aspects appeared to me as a very bad copy of the matrix with a lot of cliches: the policeman was lonely, well-shown, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with the gun ... + and shy but well-scientific , add a 2 cent plot and you, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious publicity of brands such as FedEx, Audi, Converse, etc. This movie laughs for marketing and tends to be more of a bad ads spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my enemy worse if you have free time, watch a good TV program or read a beautiful book better.
