I heard that this movie was more stylistic than director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and two smoke barrels, Snatch), which was directed before, the problem is that it's too stylistic. Practically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement and within two years he plays a lot of money. He is ready to take revenge on the casino owner who suffers from violence and sends Jake to prison, Mr. Dorothy. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In this process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days to live while dying of a rare blood disease, oh, and Macha hits men. The loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) demand that Jake pay his money back and do strange jobs for them. The film is full of Jake's story through flashbacks, and in the last three days, before coming to the great revelation about Zach and Avi and Macha, I suppose it is. They also starred Terence Maynard as Frenchman Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. There are sequences that involve a bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, and changing the speed for moments, all of which are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, making it a bad drama of crime. Pretty poor!
