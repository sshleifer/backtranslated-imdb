Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of gardens in Georgetown facing adult life situations. The story line is a mess, but some scenes are actually good. There is a lot of talent and time lost here. Distribution is more impressive than the movie. Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham are nominated. The most notable being McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty unpleasant. Age arrivals are not so easy.
