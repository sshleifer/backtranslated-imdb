Jeez, just in the '70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this strange hybrid of western spaghetti and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure hunt. The spices of this co-production drawn between the Shaw Brothers and a unique Italian company include humorous stories, wall happenings and some bold T & A. The extravagant moments are accompanied by the usual wit of Lee Van Cleef Yanka Hobbitt, beaten in biblical biblical beats, which he did with Julian Ugarte, the man who should have made European genre production more obscure than he did -o, - a witty dialogue, hilarious background music, and completely deceptive sound effects that accompany small events (especially Le Lee's leap). While this little piece of action falls and stays in the Territory of Turkey, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not wait too long, and you will get a lot of it. That's my truth. What is yours?
