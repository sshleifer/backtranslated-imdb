This performance is painstakingly watched ... It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, from constantly changing "places of work", friends and distribution. They seem to have wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but he had no idea what he came up with and came with this rough show. They threw it as a teenager, surrounded by twenty-thirty, and put it in most adult situations in repeated attempts at comedy failure. Soon, they realize he needs a "click" and threw people aged 20 to try to pass as adolescents. How did this show survive 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show and cast it into the afternoon range of the ABC family.
