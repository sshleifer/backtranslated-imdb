The premise of this film is a political cartoon. I suppose that for those who do not know anything about the realities of the army, this is probably a "good-feel" film on gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator said: "It allows women to know they can do whatever they want to do." What a beating! No one, no man or woman can do anything to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "groping" for SEAL Hell Hell Week in the BUD / S program for 27 weeks of a few sessions at a local gym and only her desire to be SEAL simply will not do so. There is an abandon rate of about 80% in what is probably the most rigorous military training program - those who voluntarily abandon, can not compete physically, suffer frequent physical injuries during training or can not handle psychological harassment . I have never surpassed the perpetuation of the alleged controversial message of this film. In the real world, Demi will not take the first 24 hours in this hard and sustained physical training. Only desire will not. Go over this movie as a hard desire and spend more time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what really happens in this workout. The bell sounds, Demi! <br /> <br />
