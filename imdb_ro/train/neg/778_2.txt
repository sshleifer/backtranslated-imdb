What has Ireland ever done to distribute to distributors that they are trying to represent the country in such a pejorative manner? This film begins as a mayor for film students on the Irish cinematographic clichés: unclean priests, spitting before shaking hands, cattle ladies, cycling on the grasslands of the country, against the background of anodyne folk music. However, it becomes obvious that the main theme of the film is the great father-O of Irish crimes - religious conflicts. It refers to a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her child of Catholic origin is educated, which would seem to be a reasonably desirable desire, though not to the 50-year-old Wexford villagers she has to live with. Rather than sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to leave and go to Belfast, then Scotland, where a few clerics are regrouped. While she is there, her father (who looks amazing as George Lucas) and the family back home are subject to a boycott, which becomes very ugly. I will not end, not because I think people should see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we should sympathize with it, but eventually urge them to make a living. Villagers are present as bigot whose prejudices should be standing, but the traumatization of your children seems an inappropriate way to go about it. In addition, she is subject to tasks she inevitably hinders when she attempts to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: the woman tells her lawyer that she "has to set preconditions" for her return. The film is probably based on a true story, but the themes have been treated with much more imaginative and less recurring clichés in the past.
