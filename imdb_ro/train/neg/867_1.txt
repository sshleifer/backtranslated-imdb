We had great hopes for this film, even if it had a bad revision in the paper. I was extremely tolerant and I stayed in the whole movie. I felt pretty bad all the way. Although I'm not at least cautious or particularly sensitive to cinemas without taste - I enjoyed both Woody Allen "Everything you ever wanted to know about sex," and "Funny Games" by Michael Hanneke - I found the obsession of directors of this age of ten who want to drink the totally disgusting female milk. And when the film culminated in an "orgy" in which the boy was drinking both his mother's milk and that of the woman he had been watching all over the film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and the sentimental pop that he It is. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as films made independently, so this movement should have been greatly satisfied. Avoid this movie at any cost, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinemas.
