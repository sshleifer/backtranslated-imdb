Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval time travel, was actually amusing. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but it was more. There have been unexpected upsets, funny situations and, of course, simple absurdity that might remind you a little of Louis de Funes. Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in large part and the same traveling time. The plan changes a bit, since the characters are supposed to be experienced travelers over time. So they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that he continues to become absurd as you advance into the movie. The Duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep up with his game, but his character has been emptied, so he can not do anything to save the movie. Now the slave / helper, he really has all the attention. The film is about him and the fact that he is cowardly / annoying / stupid or whatever he should have been. The fact is; this character tries to make the audience laugh, but he fails. It's as if someone would tell you a really bad joke, you know, but you insist to say joke to the end, adding details to make your suffering a little longer. you liked Les Visiteurs, it does not destroy the taste in the mouth with the continuation. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never think of seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I think you still have to watch a lot of movies.
