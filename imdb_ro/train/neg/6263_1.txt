Henry Hall "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of red mud from Troma. This is a horror film for young children spending the weekend at a mansion. A teacher's evil assistant draws the girls into a bizarre system to perform hideous experiments. Using a brain implant, she turns her victims and their data into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a complete piece of garbage that contains lots of nudity and some cheesy goros, not to mention a ridiculous musical score. is terrible and the script is completely incoherent. Why a piece of shit is widespread is beyond me. Avoid it as a plague.1 of 10.
