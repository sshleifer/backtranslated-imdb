this is probably the worst act I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens to pouring. the main lady in this movie has a kind of nose disfigurement and it's almost impossible to look at any time without attaching it to the nose. you can go to your local store on a Sunday afternoon and you can easily find 50 more qualified, better-seen women. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film seems to be just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I'd rather have spent an hour or so that the movie was watched on public television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this movie
