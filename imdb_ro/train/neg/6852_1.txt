This movie is really unbelievable. I've seen so many cheap garbage movies, especially many "Full Moon," but "Dollman" is very hard. So much happens: the ridiculous story, the actors always at the edge of the parody and the special effects! How long can I talk about them? It's a very bad film, but one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh, you have to see it. And do not miss "Dollman vs. Demonics Toys". It's even more fun and worse.
