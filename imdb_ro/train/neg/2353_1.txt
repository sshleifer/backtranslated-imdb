Madhur gave us a strong Chandni movie in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. Looks like the story of high-class people in India. After seeing a scene where a man forces another man to have sex in a movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidentally, I did. The reason why the film contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally shed and I was shocked to see a movie showing naked kids. Very disturbing work, we did not need to show the kids naked. One of the rich boys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to strangers, the British in this movie. I am shocked to know that this movie was a hit in parts of India, otherwise the Super Flop in the UK, the US and Australia. I'm from the UK and such stuff is bad, I should not be released in the UK.
