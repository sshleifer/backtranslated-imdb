This movie was supposed to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The act was terrible, horrible and cheesy and talked about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again and will not recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First of all, as soon as the movie started, I realized what I was involved with. All they did for this movie was copying the scenes from many other horror films there and gathered them all in this movie. The phone calls joke, the Halloween night, a psycho and a knife! Absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought would have to make horror movies. As for the making of the film, quite hilarious, as everyone talks about how great it was and so scary. I mean, you do not realize that movies are actually a cheap film of "Scary Movie" for example. At least you get some good actors out there and maybe it's been retired like a good horror movie.
