This is definitely the worst film the biggest movie I've ever seen and most probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and the actress were horrible and they seemed too hard to play their roles like dorks, eager boys, stuttering, knowing everything, etc. And the big leg was terrible. It seems to be a kind of computer-generated image from the days of Atari and Intellivision. At some point, close to the end of the movie, an army of sasquats was watched for the surviving survivors, one was shot and, as it happens, looked like a version of Kong's poor man himself! And one is hit by a bullet, and the blood that comes out of it is a terrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was music. How much music (classic or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It never ends. Oh, yes, the movie is boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. We highly recommend you take $ 3 or something else to rent this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. TRUE AWFUL!
