A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 1950s and that he now has the power to ... fling! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this film, which was directed by the great Toby Hooper and watched the wild card Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the media with individual violence. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting concern behind it, unfortunately, it does not seem to be making its own potential and prolongs its plot too long. The special effects are not bad and help to make the film in the end. The distribution is not bad, Dourif does not steal the show. Worldwide, no classic, but it's not the worst of either. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
