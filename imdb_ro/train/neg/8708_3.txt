Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of the moment my sister plays with her dolls because they can not be more rigid or fake than they were. Complot had no meaning. I mean, first I'm in a bus, then in a warehouse, all of a sudden, I'm on a boat. And to be serious, does it make sense that some dinosaurs can stay together on a ship or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit into a moving truck. It sounds stupid, even when you think about it. The only reason I gave her a 3 is that it's still fun. I found it better than the first (they did not follow the second one). Just do not rent it. I saw it on TV and it's good that I did it because I did not want to lose my rent.
