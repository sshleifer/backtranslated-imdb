Your attitude to Prom Night II will determine how much joy you get from the movie. If you expect a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like campy movies that are fun enough to watch your progress, you will love this. Lisa Schrage has the time spent in her life playing a role over Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd's perfectly angry Schrage's channels during her "possessed". Not a classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a few hours with a bad end. <br /> <br />
