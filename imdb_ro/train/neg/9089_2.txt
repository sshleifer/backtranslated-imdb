The film has only one flaw, unfortunately, this flaw destroys the credibility of the play. It begins with condemning the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. He fails to address the reason why Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attack Israel. That is why Israel "occupies" their land, because those countries lost it in a war they started. The film also claims Israel has defied the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, it was rejected immediately after its start by the ... Palestinians, making it empty. Many movies are good together, and they can really look like mind-changing images, but remember, when you look at something, you do not believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see. All the participants in this film are Israel's critics, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, removing any possible credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants urgently need a real historical lesson, objectively taught, not by a Palestinian sympathizer.
