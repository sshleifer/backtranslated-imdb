Luise Rainer received an Oscar for his performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role was not necessary. He did not say too much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then married Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Established in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni received an Oscar for his show, because Luise must have won the Academy Award. She must have been an actress discovered, one of the methods from the first to the method. This seems to be something that Hollywood often does. Al Pacino sang an Italian and Cuban song. I felt that Luise's performance was devoid of scale, and when he died he did not change in expression from previous scenes. She remained the same throughout the film; she has only changed her expression or emotion twice. If her brilliant act was so subtle, I suppose I did not see him.
