It was 1974 and starred in Martin Sheen's lead role. That's what she's telling herself about waiting for this movie. It was a movie. According to the film, Slovik reformed, took a good woman and did not want to fight. In real life, Slovik could have been a naive naive or just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who was or was not Slovik is for history to decide, but this was a film that dealt with desertion at a time when a country had asked why it was fighting and the film took < <br /> <br /> With no attention to the military who were in Vietnam either in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's say the truth, it was the Vietnam War, not the Second World War), EoES it was propaganda that Gung Ho was in the forties. According to this film, Slovik has declared his position, simple and simple. She had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a nervous clinical state and believe me, if I had done my military duty, it would not have been a problem for me either to let my nerves go and fail to fulfill my tasks and get a drop, latrine fee without any problems. If we believe teleflick, Slovik did not have this option, no doubt because of his criminal history. Whatever the spectator wants to believe depends on the viewer. I have learned that movies of this decade or that decade, in terms of service or military duty, will similarly take the same position again. <br /> <br /> 1940 and 1950, serve your country <br /> <br /> 1960s and 1970s, mocking your country <br /> <br /> This is history. The whole movie seemed to me for Hollywood. He refused to serve and only when he was bound to be executed, he shows emotions. Such an emotional outburst could have easily acted to his advantage in declaring his nervous condition, but obviously the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die becomes sadness . I'm not a Catholic, but I've been thinking about the hailing show by Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with God's prayer, it was funny because they thought they were trying to see who could say it sooner. I do not see how this movie could be seen without realizing that it was intended for Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. I hope he deserved everything for Slovik and whoever chose to follow his example.
