This movie was terrible and an insult to the spectator. A bad scenario, bad casting, endless boredom. In the usual Hollywood tradition, the US government is always bad. The sympathizer of the Hollywood Communists, most of whom are just as stupid as a box of stones, love to take Eugene McCarthy and imagine him as the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at that time he was considered a relief character, exploiting a legitimate concern over the Soviet Communists for political gains. Oh, yes, and the US brought all those nasty wicked. Like Werner VonBraun, without which we have no space program. He really loved being American and became a big advantage for the country. Still, the irony is that the Hollywood fools, a unworthy batch of fantasy, still believe the government should lead everything and give us everything we want. And yet, it is the same government that he portrays continuously as a perfect evil in such films.
