Have you ever seen a movie when it's been 20 or 30 minutes and you suddenly realize you've seen the movie before? This happened to me with the "Young Graduates". The cover of the video cassette, if you can find the video, is extremely deceptive. I swear the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. Anyway, I was or was born a decade too late to appreciate the finer touches of this movie or ... it is simply useless. I've leaned a lot on the latter, but I think some have developed a connection to this movie. Hmm ... plot. A plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot here somewhere. No, I can not find it. There is quite a lot about some high school seniors who act sweet and do drugs and speak in a language that has become obsolete decades ago. One of the female students has a passionate love for her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (which he really refers to as an iceberg), so he is receptive to the progress made by the girl. There is a lot of dialogue and a lot of spastic dances. Our cat, BooBoo, was transmitted by high school children. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers giggled and shuddered on the dance floor. It is nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
