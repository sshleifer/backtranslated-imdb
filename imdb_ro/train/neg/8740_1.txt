My friends and I hired the movie last night and I had one of the biggest laughs for some time. The film should not be fun at all, but it is just ridiculous and has no realism. First of all, Phillippe (I forgot what he calls his character and I do not care) uses the employee's usual ID to get through all the top security terminals. Not only is he pitiful, but is overcome when his enormous efforts culminate in finding such a frightening Lego room that houses supercomputers. This is simply funny. The tense state we should live is completely spoiled by the childhood room. The conclusion, like all others, is very gross, especially when the bad guy's lawyer appears "on time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to have fun, definitely visit.
