I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read him some time ago and I usually enjoy the BBC drama. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as this: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than I moved like the novel. First of all, music (and songs) seems to be totally undetected in an era drama (it sounds like it was written for a contemporary horror movie) and, as another commentator, I was really annoyed much of how the cameras have rotated and rotated around the actors. I have seen some scenes shot in "North and South" and I found myself well there, but in The Tenant, it is definitely overwhelmed and simply annoying. Room moves can not make animated woodwork. Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first, and the scenario was not clear. None of the characters were correctly entered at the beginning. The boy gave a very good performance, is very cute and the best feature of the movie. THE SPOILS Helen Graham's Tara Fitzgerald's characterization made her look cold and harsh without emotion. She does not seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I could not believe that Markham could have fallen for her and did not mention the terrible hairstyle she had received. I could not feel sympathy with her husband! Fancy married to such a virago ... In addition, he was the only main actor who sounded good to me. Toby Stephens I found just fine, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be hard to adapt a novel that deals with terrible subjects like alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what is just clear and left to the reader's imagination in the book is admirable in the adaptation of TV: making both gross and comic scenes (such as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed) and others too sexy for a the period of theater! I mean, do not we have enough scenes of these beds in contemporary dramas?
