** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> The Cabin Fever kicked me up for the MULTI movie this year ... that I've seen so. This movie is GARBAGE! It's not so much wrong with the movie you can not help, but do not forget how bad it is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but it did not do anything about it. The characters were as bad as anyone could be; for the whole movie you're just asking "why would you do that?" or "what is your purpose in doing this?" ... that's how illogical and stupid the characters are. We have no background in them, so naturally you really do not give rats about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity. Marcy, for example ... was that excited that he had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in it ... almost as if filmmakers needed an excuse to give the virus so voluptuous! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would someone really go to the woods and drink the water from a cabin without looking at him first? - Why did not Bert just shoot at the beginning? The movie would have been that way ... besides, they got to kill him anyway. - Why did it take so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if he had to walk? "No, I will only wait for two of my friends to be infected (one blinking from death) to finally choose to get out of there." What exactly was the reason behind Paul's attempt to fish from Hermit's body just to fall into the contaminated reservoir and infect the virus? PURE STORY! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less a relationship with these idiots. I do not think there's ever been a worse movie. At first, children ask the hop shop's cashier for what the shotgun was, and he replied that "it's for the blacks." At the end of the movie, three young black men (clothed in cluttered clothes, one of them in a duel no less) come into the shop ... they come to find out that the cashier clears him for hunting. Then, he continues to give them all the weight and handshake and joke around with them as if they were his nuns. Okay, what was his point?!?!?!? How wonderful can anyone be, who were those who created THINKING movies that put them in the movie? I, as a black man, was, of course, offended by the original commentary "Nigger." It was a noteless and worthless remark. My question about filming: what was the end point with the black kids? Was that forcing me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? To align things with black spectators, making a joke of it? Well, for one, I did not find that pathetic humorous attempt at the smallest. The whole movie was a joke ... a PATHETIC shooting attempt that should not be given time. Did Peter Jackson really believe this movie was so good? What movie did he look at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * from star **** ... if I could give her a lower rating. Please, IMDberi colleagues, do not miss 1Â½ hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a "movie". This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
