If this movie is meant to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and nothing ever happened. This film is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of method users. This movie can earn a prize for using the word "F" so many times and so useless. It was not well said, but I felt like it would make Meth replace Meth that they owed to someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl became more hopeless. The end had no meaning. The movie made sense only if it showed how annoying it is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a metal head. I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie, and the evaluation of this movie should be a much smaller average.
