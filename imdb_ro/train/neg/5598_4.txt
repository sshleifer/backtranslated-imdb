He saw her at Gay and Lesbian Film Fest in Philadelphia. What can I say? Together with my better judgment I liked it, but it seemed to me that the action was a bit ... poor (especially I noticed this from the adolescent boy's family). I mean, the script was not stellar in the beginning, but the actors did not make me believe the relationships. Plot is also predictable. I liked. Characters are full of love, and the plot is not provocative or upsetting. It's cute, the characters take care of each other and do not call him as stupid for fifty minutes. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
