Terrible ... terrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen some pretty bad pictures over the years. The sound is shit, so is the quality of the image, the direction, the action ... etc, etc. The only good lentils (that's funny because they're so bad) are the special effects. Generally there is laugh about 5 minutes. The rest of the movie gives you brain damage.
