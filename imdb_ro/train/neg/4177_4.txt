The second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This film was quite average. It's pretty boring in some parts, but there are some good gore effects, but they are not big, though. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in 2210. The vampires have taken quite a bit over the whole world. The V-SAN (Sanitation Vampire) squad, which has its own space ship and is run by Churchill, captured by the vampires, receives a message from Earth and the team formed by Quintana (played by Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and Rosa and Roman rebels (The novel is played by Aaron Pearl from accused accused.) V-SAN later meets with Muco vampire leader, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans to live in peace with people because he is bent on world domination. <br /> <br /> While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I will be back in the DVD player soon.
