I'm not saying that because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. That shot of the girl who washed her hair in the brook? Do we really need to sit there for a long shot and keep track of it for 5 minutes at the same place? It was terrible, the light was simply bad. You could hardly see anything and when the characters spoke, you barely heard what they were saying. Did I look at the entire movie? Of course I have not missed any more and I do not want to hear anyone say that I have to look at the first thing to judge it first. This movie was so badly made and executed that even after independent and low-budget standards it's simply terrible. The great movie ... do not waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors' funny lines, it's because of how subtle the production is.
