O.K. We do not make the bad movie if it were from an original script. BUT NOT IT IS! What part of "there are no women in this story except for Foulata and Gagoola" did Haggard's introduction not make the producers, the directors and the writers understand? I mean, it's quite clear in English. I understand it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be more than enough for even the most mediocre producers to work with. But, nooo, you have to throw "romance" into it. Pathetic. Suggest to all your poor souls who thought this would be close to the book. Give up. Until a Peter Jackson wizard comes in and "is right," you can resume reading the volume. BTW, there is a sequential book (actually a pre-quel) named Allan's wife. It provides a background for Quatermain's story. It's a little weird, but good.
