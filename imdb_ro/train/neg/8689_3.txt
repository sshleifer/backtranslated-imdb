The main problem with "Power" is that there are too many characters and unnecessary characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie. She gets boring after a while, sitting around waits through scenes that does not connect to find something that drives the movie before. You may probably disable them as character development, but all of them are either recycled from the previous scenes of the movie or are just plain smooth and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to allow any supportive casting flower. He should have cut some of the characters (hackman, wife) and focus more on others (Billings). It could have been a tough, tough political thriller instead of a miserable misery that loses any message in a great writing and bad actors, which has amazed me in considering the expression. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not up to the point. Denzel Washington is the only real actor here. Gere and others have done much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet has to return to a ferocious man he did in the seventies (Serpico) and stop trying to resume his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe" . Sidney has not worked yet, and most likely will never be. leave the ensemble dramas at Altman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span>
