I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although fascinating visually (for example, the use of color was absolutely amazing), it was quite boring and disturbing (see incest father / son). Moreover, music is totally absent, and if you think of these wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films) then you can imagine what a difference he makes.
