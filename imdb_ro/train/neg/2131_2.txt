I wanted to see a comedy action with a satirical twist (as this movie was filmed), but that made me miss. For me, the plot was a little confusing to track and quickly lost interest. I'm so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff because you got involved in this movie. I will remain a fan of all, but only time can heal my feelings about it. The only thing I can say positively about the movie is that Hillary interpreted Yonica's character so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; she took some scenes to understand she was. Fortunately, I rented it for $ 1 through the Red Box; would have paid to see it on the big screen, I would really be fuming!
