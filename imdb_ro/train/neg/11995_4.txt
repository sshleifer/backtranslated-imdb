I was so excited and I was watching this movie when the promo was out for the first time in November! She looked great and songs! I was rather disappointed when I went to see him! This is a movie that weaves 6 couples together. Has a multiple distribution of 12 people! A great deal of stars have worked on this movie. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, did not do well and he should not have had many people in this movie because it would have made it easier for him. Compared with Nikhil's directorial debut, "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" is far behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller cast. I think the best factors of this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are wonderful, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did excellent work over the years. I think the rating of this movie could grow thanks to the excellent tracks! One thing I was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film, made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude looking at him with his family! Although some can find this nude as a comedy, it's not something you would want to watch with your parents! I think the best actress was interpreted by Salman and Priyanka In general, I think it's a good movie!
