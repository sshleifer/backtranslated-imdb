The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. Recycle a lot of images (including opening credits and final title) from Criminally Insane. The new record, shot on video, is really so badly destroyed. The scenes do not have adequate lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaccessible, there are even video bullets such as the rolled image and so on. Like all evil sequels, basically just repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills all those who share their living space, often for reasons connected with them in letting go of the food they want. At least it's just a DVD extra for the first to include Satan's Black Wedding's same director. Too bad it does not include Death Sources.
