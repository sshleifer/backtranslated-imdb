The veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose huge series of films includes both useful and repeatable ones (for example, John Wayne in "Iwo Jima Sands"), tried a great music hand with "I Dream of Jeanie ". Using a cast full of singers with little film experience and, as it turned out, almost without a future, he turned a fictional and not offensive story about the great American composer, Stephen Foster. Bill Shirley is the young man, Foster's boyfriend, whose kindness toward slaves involves giving money for an engagement ring to pay the cost of the hospital for a tiny black-wounded boy. His intent is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose little sister, Jeanie (Eileen Christy), slowly realizes that she is in love with the almost impeccable theater play. Foster is in love with Inez, who is revolted by the composer's number one in the song "Parade Tune Hit," "O Susannah." Enter Edwin P. Christy (Ray Middleton) to help launch the profitable career of Foster. This is, through the musical-cinematic standards of the early fifties, a great production. The sets are generous in that particular way from Hollywood, which presents forgeries with all the seals. The singers are not half bad and Foster songs are almost impossible to destroy. But this is also a literal white of the South Antebellum. The biggest number is black for all on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of racism. If these portraits of blacks were close to reality, abolitionists would be rightfully condemned to interfere with such a beneficial institution. "I Dream of Jeanie" apparently sank into the studio safe with a whisper of death. Now, revived by Alpha Video for a mere $ 4.99, it's an eternal song with charming songs and a repellent sentiment about the victims of the great American crime, slavery. This was what Hollywood put two years before Brown v. Education Council. He must have warmed the hearts of some animators who wore bedding at the theater.
