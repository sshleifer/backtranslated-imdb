I was looking forward to watching this movie and seeing these great actors perform. However, I was unfortunately disappointed by the script and the whole story of the story. David Duchovny (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", 04 was the doctor who uses the drug and loses the license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited a nightclub and managed to use her medical experience to help an injured client and was assisted by Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Taking Lives", "04", who is immediately attracted by Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey," 04, plays Big Shot Gangster and a man with all sorts of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to act in most scenes and retreats from his mind, trying to hinder them Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series," plays an important role in supporting and portrays a real COOL DUDE, the so-called bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. beautiful and sexy with her red ruby ​​lips that attracts a lot of attention from all men. This film is not the biggest but entertaining.
