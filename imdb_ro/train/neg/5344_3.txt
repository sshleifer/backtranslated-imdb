You remember Spice Girls and how bad it was (along with songs) and their manager, Simon Fuller (and the manager of this band), make the same mistakes as S Club (one of my favorite bands) to be in their own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) He asks their boss for a break, , to watch TV! Three of them exchange and, conversely, they discover half that they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half is in trouble. He also tries Gareth Gates as a clone of his. This film may have more of a plot than Spice Girls, but besides the songs "Get It All Back", "Do not Stop Moving" and "Never Had a Dream", this is not a reason for watch this movie. Not long after the band broke up well. Suitable!
