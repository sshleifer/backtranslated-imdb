I was true about myself for Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. I watched the whole movie with my family and friends. I have no idea what the movie was. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their bigger efforts. She does not get along very well. It's too tangled and there's a little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been a lot better. I waited for months to see this movie based on line notes. Do not waste money unless you're complete and you just want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. It was a poor way to spend an evening.
