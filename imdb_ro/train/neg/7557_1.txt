This movie was terrible. Okay, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I was always compelled to be a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The park returns along, throwing enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' very dubious. (He's not a virgin, but he's allergic to bees. WOW!) That's how many things that make no sense and are unexplained, I'm afraid Mr. LaBute does not make a horror movie. (How are two people that I saw clearly in a car at first, alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cage seems to be stingy and amazed all along, and his character is prone to the call "Rowan !? " at the smallest noise. "Knots" to the original are irritating as they appear as tribute rather than as intelligent tribute. For example, some incidents mirror the original (The girl who falls from a closet claiming to be dead when Woodward / Cage searches for the island) and some lines of dialogue are pulled straight from the original Anthony Schaffers scenario and footwear. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than that, really can not be bothered to write about this movie. It has no substance. Throw it on the pile of remnants with all the other remakes that spoiled the good names of the films they were based on (in this case, very poor).
