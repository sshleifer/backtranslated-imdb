I've heard so much about this movie. I watched her with my best friend (she's a woman, I'm a man). Now, let me give you a divergent opinion from the mainstream. After the first twelve "take off your clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of anger and boredom. I laughed (at this, not with her), we went (and it would have been better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we spent the money in vain. And I had it. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people it was impossible to care about. A loss of money, a waste of celluloid. This film does not deserve even one in ten votes, but it is the least available. I'm not sure why this movie has the reputation of being excellent; I do not recommend this to anyone who even has a modicum of taste or intelligence.
