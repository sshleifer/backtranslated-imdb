There are a lot of pretentious people who will claim that this is endowed with some beautiful meaning and that ignorant madmen like me do not "receive" this. Obviously, this means we should stick to Hollywood slag. He has every artistic clich√© in the book - I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen. Almost a self-parody drowns in her own claim. The director of the movie "Ratcatcher" (almost as embarrassing) returns with another piece softening in artistic nonsense; is hard to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is alienated to its viewers.
