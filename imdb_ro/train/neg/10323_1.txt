I was delighted to see a sitcom that would represent, we hope the Indian Candians, but I found this show not to be fun at all. Manufacturers and distributors are probably happy to receive both bad and good feedback because, as far as they are concerned, it is talked about! I was ready for some stereotype and have no problem with it, because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But it really was not funny about these stereotypical characters. The "fresh boat" father, who does not understand his daughter. The radical Muslim feminine daughter (who, by the way she is a terrible actress), and the modern young man trying to escape his mosque as politically correct as he can (he is a pretty good actor, I see only better) . <Br>> <br /> It is very controversial and the dialogue does not flow so well. there was not so much potential for this, but unfortunately I think it failed, and I really do not care to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, again, she's always a living and a natural thing about everything she does, too bad her daughter in the show does not have the same acting skills!
