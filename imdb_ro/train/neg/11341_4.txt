In a way, this is the disaster that Fellini has spent all his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and the crap of free association is very small and in what category it will finally fit the movie often depends on personal feelings. Having said that, "Casanova" left me in cold admiration for his sets and a little more, which can not be summed up more appropriately by Bukowski: "Casanova also died just an old man with a big cock and one to say I can spit on the tomb without feeling it is also true. Usually ladies go to the biggest mad I find, so the human race stands where it happens today: I multiplied Casanovas , intelligent and lasting, inwardly, like Easter bunnies that we cultivate for poor children. " <br /> <br /> As far as I could do this, this is Fellini's position on his subject; but with more and more disappointment. Casanova's environment is made of disintegration and incest, the themes that Fellini treated more closely in "Satyricon". The plot sequence is a porn-soft feature, only without coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and thin to the point of distraction. However, it could be just a point in portraying Casanova as a mad fool. And I have challenged anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, it seems that he is here like a dirty old man - a master, certainly, but one whose impulses are more satisfied than anybody else. I find it hard to imagine an audience enjoying this movie. It was a story that is not worth it.
