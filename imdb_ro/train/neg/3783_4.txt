It was not the most useless animation experience ever, but it certainly can not be admired as long as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, who offers the story of the first person), and his journey through the Old West frontiers. Practically, he is born freely among all the other horses in the beautiful landscape, then is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, managing to throw everyone who tries to ride it. Still, when they get out of the cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form a friendship, oh, and obviously has something for Little Creek's female horse. Finally, after several escapades, being pursued by Colonel James Cromwell and his men, and making a big jump over a gully, Little Creek lets the Spirit go, and he frees his female horse and runs home to their rural environment and other horses. Also, try Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Coordinator, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected to see the horses speak in this movie, but it looks like it's more like Dumbo, and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most appealing, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for Best Motion Picture Oscar, and was nominated Golden Globe for Best Song for "Here I Am" by Bryan Adams. Good!
