"Power Play" starts interesting, but it goes quickly up the hill. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or redeem interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so controversial and absolutely unbelievable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third-grade students putting on a game. It's terrible, just terrible. The bottom line, if "Power Play" was made in the 60's or 70's, would be considered a poor-grade "B" movie. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a class "D" movie? If so, "Power Play" throws the die.
