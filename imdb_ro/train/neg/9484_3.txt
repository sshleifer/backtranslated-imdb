If I have to give this film a linear score, then I have to give it a low score of 3/10. But it was fun and there are some good things to say about the movie. Candidate psychiatrist James Bishop is designated for St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and is outgoing and eager to "change the world." From the start of the movie you know the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but James thinks he can make the difference and does not recognize this evil. The story builds pretty well, you always know that there is a truth in what patients say about a bad resident and wonders when and how James will discover this. Also, when the break comes, James is somehow hunted by evil, and you feel some suspense until the "fight" is over. Add a beautiful innocent girlfriend who gets in the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture. <br /> <br /> Characters are actually pretty good, you are shown to most of the people who are killed, some of them will "know". <The movie sets up an unpleasant scene, this happens pretty well. There are mysteries that are revealed - in an acceptable way. The main character, James is very credible - the story of an impatient student who is starting to work is good in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * stupid special effects - a modern version of 'Plan 9 of the cosmic space' - bad guy (bad monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad actors very few take pictures) - The main characters act sometimes bad, and sometimes good. * Sound is sometimes very cheap. I've always thought "I could make a movie like this with my home camcorder" throughout the movie.
