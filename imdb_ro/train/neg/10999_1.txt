Imagine the most serious skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute film. Now, imagine that the humor of these skits is not removed and replaced with stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. Did you understand? Ok, now go to Underground Comedy. The vision you just had will look like the funniest thing so far. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. There were some cheap laughs ... very few. But it was terrible. Even if the intention of the film was to be blades, it was too strange to be fun. The only reason why I was not upset that I lost my time watching this was someone else I know bought. He scattered his money. Vince's offer has not written and directed anything else, and it's no surprise why.
