... And be bigger than ever. I will not make any direct reference or something here, but at least this movie is pathetic. If you are a military instructor, do not worry. I put it on DVD with 2 friends who want to watch some sort of interesting action / war. Why could not I read my first review. Already at the first scene of "bomb" the movie has huge glitches and continues to look and become bigger and bigger. The two friends, unrelated to the military, noticed in some way a director's mistakes almost as fast as me and asked if some things happen we are realistic. Well, as you probably guessed, I'm not - at all. Avoid this movie if you can not overlook these completely idiotic mistakes and that happens again. 2/10 to catch my interest at first.
