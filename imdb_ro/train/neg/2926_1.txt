There seems to be a curse when it comes to homosexual cinema. That is, happy endings are not very common. Excitingly exclusive, homosexual films tend to end up in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, just end ... the period. The creators of this dreadful nonsense have one thing or two to learn about plot, direction, and time. In the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a little confused, and all the more so since I first saw the character of Jeremie Elkaim having a little psychic session. It seems that this movie was randomly combined without the slightest attempt of continuity or consistency. There is no real way to say when you are viewing the presentation or kind of ethereal flashback. I could only take so long before I became truly untouchable. Stephen Holden of The New York Times has called this movie "... brightly beautiful and absolutely real." Well, it seems Stephen has invested in beer glasses before watching because this is really far from beautiful. Thanks to all the praise this film received, I expected something worth watching. Unfortunately, the film lived up to its title. And by the end of the movie (which did not offer any resolution, I could add), it is clear that writers, director and film have all come back.
