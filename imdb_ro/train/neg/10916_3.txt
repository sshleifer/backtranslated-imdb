For the inner audience, I see how they would applaud this movie. For the outsiders, no interested interests, it made little sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent, and the Russians as heroes. Probably the romantic angle was useless and a distraction. How a young woman could love the lieutenant not to look at him was stupid. How could, as mentioned at the end of the film, never get married just because of this infatuation it was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and this was exemplified in pursuit in the marsh. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russians into the marsh. So the Russians were hiding, and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and just stood there listening. I suppose they do not want to make their wet boots, but I'm sure an officer would order 20 or 30 people to search for the swamp. But that would have finished the story. The Germans also entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the attic and were not used to burning in the roof. In the worst case, a soldier would throw a grenade in the attic and would not have climbed a ladder to see. I've seen some reviewers who say they screamed at the end. I wonder why? You knew that this little band would perish and that they had nothing to do with it.
