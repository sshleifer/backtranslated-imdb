I searched for a copy of the Forest because I was looking at a particular VH1, I think "Where are they now" and saw that the video clip flashes on a screen during a segment on actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male ghost in this awful horror B, but he remembers his Freddy character on the TV show Spoon Silver. This blow is a major defeat. There's nothing here. It actually took me four months to pursue it from start to finish. I continued to stop her in boredom, leaving him aside and forgetting her, then trampling on her and trying once more to go through her. Obviously, the angle of this film, which was meant to distinguish it from its counterparts, was the supernatural element, the appearances. And obviously here, it does not work. I can not stand male conductors. I expected to look down at their palms during several dialog scenes to read lines of deception. The situation at the beginning, in which couples decide to move separately, is inconvenient and stupid. I think the only positive thing to say about this is the scene where the guy collapses and breaks his leg, you can see the bone is missing from his flesh. It's pretty good makeup there. Man, I'm really coming right now, huh. The only other horror movie without a budget on such a bad level as this is Home Sweet Home.
