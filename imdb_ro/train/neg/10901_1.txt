And more "no" above. Voodoo Academy is undoubtedly the least ambitious film of all time. What is it trying to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; as has been pointed out, most of them are just the legally skilled guys who are rubbing. Could it be a subversive homoeroticism attempt? Well, maybe if not because you never ever go beyond the most harmless and nonthreatening forms of male contact. (Which is, for the joy of nobody, repeated eighty thousand times.) Well, it's kind of horror film; Is he trying to scare us? Not unless the director intended to do so through all the tedium and the emptiness of his "work". Never in my life I liked a less movie. This is the most boring and useless thing I have ever seen. It's like Voodoo Academy takes the horror genres, zombies and homosexual movies, puts them in a grinder, then passes them through a coffee filter - only to be a sort of coffee filter that filters the beans coffee that takes everything vital, nervous or in any interesting way. The result is 74 minutes of movie as interesting as a glass of warm water - only without the ability to rehydrate after the 10-day gin that will inevitably meet you if you follow this abomination of human effort.
