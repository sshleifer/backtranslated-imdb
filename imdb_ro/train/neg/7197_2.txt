O.K. I think the TV show is pretty nice and always has a lesson involved. So when my kids decided to see this movie, I decided to tag them. I would have liked to stay at home and see the television show instead. The fact that humor is silly and non-original is the slightest of the problems with this movie. Complot is next to nonexistent, characters seem to exist in a vacuum and, worst, Gadget has no lessons. Disney seems to have taken all the things that make Inspector Gadget work on television and throw them all. To be fair, my younger child (8 years old) liked the movie, but the oldest (10 years) came away, believing it was bad (she was too old for the humor of the young but too young for any adult humor) /> <br /> Generally, I like Disney movies, but this happens a mile. It's good for a very narrow age band (from 7 to 9), but you have to miss anyone else.
