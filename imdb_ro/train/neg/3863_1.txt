Wow. It's about how much I can say right now. Who writes these things? Who does these things? What self-respecting actor would agree to "act" on these things? Oh God! I do not know how I did it through this movie, but I assume I had 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake. Good God! It was one of the most exaggerated and predictable cinematic pieces I've ever seen ... and for recording, I never intend to "confess" it again. the movie when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. It's cool. I will watch her as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to pursue her without cracking every five minutes, wondering when this bunch of nonsense is over, I really did. But I was not successful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean, what is with that thing where she imagines what will happen then returns to real life? It was pretty annoying when his father used to do it in Parenthood ten years ago. "Glumele" - and I think it takes a lot of me to tell them - they're stupid, the characters are nice and forgotten, the story is fully predictable ... it's all about doing a movie that should be injured HISTORY RECORDS! I should have believed that something happened when I realized that I had never heard of this movie. It was most likely a direct-to-DVD movie. For anyone who thinks to look at this, I have some advice. NOT! For the love of God ... NO! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection and I can not get rid of it ... No one and I mean NOBODY wants to buy me! And I'm talking about third-hand hands and hand shops that would buy mud on the shoes and stick it in the shop window. That's what you need to figure out how fast CRAP is.
