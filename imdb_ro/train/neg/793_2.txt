I was not sure how to rate this movie because it was so bad it was very funny. I am not a Gackt fan by any means, although he is talented, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat wearing a hairball. However, I thought Hyde was talented, but Faith is an interesting album. But on the subject here. This movie is ridiculous. It's so up and down, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. The film has almost no plot here, except that it's about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, as there were too many ideas, which did not result in enough time to pay attention to one of them. The scenes of action were ridiculous. Rapidly edited, almost hard to grasp, with such ridiculous choreography. Although Hyde has been very stylish during action scenes, but that's the only redeem of this movie. I'm a sucker for good action movies, but the action was terrible. Although the last shot was OK and the climax of this film was otherwise depressing. She continues to jump between genres, not a good thing. He wants to be a drama or a shot of action or a horror or a love story ... what the hell. If this review makes you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Do not be fooled, this movie is stupid.
