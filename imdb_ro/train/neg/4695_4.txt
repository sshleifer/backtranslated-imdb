I watched this movie a few times and never thought it was so funny, but it's still fun to watch and be good for a few laughs. It's about women who work at a company and their boss is a stupid guy and they get to taste his own medicine and try to get the respect he deserves. The actor is very good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80 stars who plays a good guy bad, not bad, just inappropriate. Dolly Partin is full of love and fun to watch in comedies and along her, the spirit of the south shines here. Jane Fonda is so and he does not have much for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh aloud several times, I have to love her. I could recommend this to anyone who likes the comedy for 80 years. I like the movie, but it has things I do not like about it. It starts very well and has a beautiful flow and then everything starts to meet together and makes me care less of the characters. Everybody has little fancy about what the boss would want to do, and though "cute" I thought he slowed down the flow of the movie. As the movie goes on, it resumes and the funniest things happen and then slows again, just to conclude in a quick manner that is too good to be true. 4 out of 10 stars, but try if you did not see it. I think, depending on the state of mind, may be more or less sympathetic.
