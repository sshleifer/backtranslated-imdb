From the opening scene you will see how hard they have been trying to imitate the smartest and strongest "cruel intentions" and how flat landed. You will also notice a terrible choice made by Robin Dunne as Valmont ... Then in the second scene, meet the two good things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can go through the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... Then the movie continues, you see the cheap romantic story from the mile ago and you notice that Sebastian has already met Anette in the past, called Danielle here, and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... How original is for a prequel. Then it turns into a "Wild Things" movie with a low budget, with lots and lots of twists. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's fine ... He has no Ryan charisma. Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, offers again. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way to save this garbage. Overall, this "movie" feels like an episode "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from "Cruel Intentions" and "Jawbreaker" ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could not let the other alone? You want to get through this. If you want more brutal intentions, watch Stephen Frears's dangerous connections.
