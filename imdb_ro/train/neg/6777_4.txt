While I recently gave OPTICA PETTICOAT a positive review, I really did not like this movie, even if it had so many similarities. Both were made only a few years apart, both played by Cary Grant and both were comedies of the Second World War. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, as a whole, looked like a cheaper movie - low writing, little energy, and some very broad performances - even when compared to PETTILIZED OPTIMIZATION. I think at least part of the blame for that is in throwing Jayne Mansfield. The combination of ample talents and limited ability to act has really made this A-Budget movie come from a third-rate studio. In addition, there was not much chemistry or energy in associating her with Cary Grant - an actor who generally loved grace and class. It's something like Sir Lawrence Olivier's mating with Marjorie Main.
