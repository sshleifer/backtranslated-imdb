When HEY ARNOLD! for the first time came into the air in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to show up, so I'm tired of waiting for new episodes and no longer seeing. I was quite surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! MOVIE because it does not seem to be nearly as popular as some of Nickelodeon's other cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, having nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. Going into the theater, I did not expect too much. I was expecting to be a kinematic version of a cartoon for children, like RECESS. I think I got what I expected. It was a bad movie and nothing. There were good parts here and there, but for the most part the film was dirty. Simply for children.
