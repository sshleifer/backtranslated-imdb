I can not believe that this movie has managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It's just watched and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. In a budgetless way I remembered the Star I and II Episodes for the simple impression that you were watching a total train wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "festival films" that just pray the pseudo-intellectuals because I'm so bad that people think they make it "different", that's why it's good. The bad movie is not "different," it's just a bad movie.
