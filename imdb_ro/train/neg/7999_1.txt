this is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching her after an hour and I regretted that watch a lot. the act is horrible and there is almost no plot. I suppose someone came up with a strange form of animal and started to make a story around her. borrowing ideas from films like Resident Evil and Aliens does not result in a movie like them. if it is going to be a top Korean movie, I would prefer not to bother to see even a Korean movie trailer ... By the way, these movies are good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means that the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online games has rated this movie over 8 years, even though he has no idea what it is about.
