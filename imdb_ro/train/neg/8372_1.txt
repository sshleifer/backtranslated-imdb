I can say categorically and unequivocally that all 51 years on this planet is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I took the three big kids to see him and even they struggled to lift a smile during the 90-minute heavy. Sexual indendoes will go on another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. They should pay you to see that you do not pay them. It's really terrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be brought to the task to take money under false pretenses. I apologized for my mistakes, but I'm so upset that it has ruined the time I had with my grandchildren. Greetings, Stephen
