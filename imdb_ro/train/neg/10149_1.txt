I can not believe Steven Segal's career has reached such a low that he has been reduced to making fourth-degree films with fifth-rate side actors. I looked at this movement, expecting him to see him dig like some people as usual. When he is low on using a single judo hammer between the lamellae to eject an opponent and the type falls like a ton of bricks something is not good. The plot is incredible as a movie, and even if you excuse the images and you read this story as a novel, you would be left to wonder why you even took the book. Steven Segal goes through the moves and seems to be doing just that because he is bound. He does not show any effort or enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not appear at all. I do not like to repeat the comments of other people, but the use of images for cut scenes and for visual aircraft flying are pathetic. Scene scenes are unclear, and the scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The Zappruder movie, which shows that President John F Kennedy is assassinated, is more consistent and cleaner. My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time watching this movie, it is not in accordance with the standards of its work the blighted man or the wounds of the exit. I read a review that said the movie had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal being paid 5 of it) and that the movie was still under budget. I have to agree. No wonder this is a direct DVD movie because no conscientious theater owner would play this movie.
