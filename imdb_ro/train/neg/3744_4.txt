This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds' theory of Guns, Germs and Steel, explaining how Europeans dominated most of the globe. The version we saw about this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely unnecessary scenes: Professor Jared Diamond seeing the birds through the binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond did not manage to use the bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond throwing a potato charger. The documentary should have made a hero of "Professor Jared's diamond?" This part of the documentary was so bad that it could have been a doll. The worst thing was when Diamond was shown to break up and cry when going to the Malaria section of an African hospital. None of these things help me understand his theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times. "Europe's guns, germs, and steel can get out of this terrible situation. Stay calm and find out!" When it finally comes to business, its theory is equal to interesting and absolutely dull parts. Europeans conquered local peoples from other countries because they had weapons and fine blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a teacher to convince me of that? The parts of his theory explaining how Europeans have come to have the advantages that make up conquests are interesting, but coverage is thin on paper. Finally, I think the documentary is just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I already know that. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me with his immense use of native tools. I do not think adults are the target audience for this documentary. Children can enjoy more than I do. I read that book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
