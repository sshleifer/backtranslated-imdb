STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, after defeating Freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to rethink his life. But her unborn baby has a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to get out again in their world. It's interesting to note the directors who made their big breaks in the direction of Freddy's films - Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (Long Kiss Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and Stephen Hopkins space, Predator 2) But while Russell and Harlin did a good job, IMO Hopkins did something a podgeu with this entry, which should be forgotten quickly. The story is clearly stretched as far as it can go here, with Freddy ridiculous by the father himself and the ridiculous demon child. Even about an hour and a half, everything gets tiring and, of course, it is not scary at all. The catch phrase "appetite for good" is the only remembrance of this one, a very forgetful entry. *
