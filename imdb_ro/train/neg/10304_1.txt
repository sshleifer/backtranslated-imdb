Here, let me put my hand over the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad she wants to order. over and over, works like a charm: is a genius, how does he do? my shit detector, if I go to this show when I scan the channels, I have to be very careful (these days it is useful too often, so I do not need him to be destroyed by idiotic cracks like this ... careful with that remote!). is this supposed to be a fascist propaganda to make people believe in an invisible field of control and domination of the uberman? or what? why are they there? This is the most spectacular show, completely unbelievable and controversial, and I do not understand why it's still in the air. so the geek can give a lot better performances in such a difficult time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but let it go without meaning. looks like Firefly (if it exists like that) disappears after a season, but mind stuff like this, which makes logical zero sense only continues to score. yeccch.
