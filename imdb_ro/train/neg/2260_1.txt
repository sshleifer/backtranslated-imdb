Oh Dear, Jerry can be the incontestable king of the talkshow, but the movies are a game quite different from the ball, and he is no longer in the league. The script for this movie is so poor that it has to be seen to be believed and sad to see actors so vaguely familiar as Michael Dudikoff (80-year-old B'movie's King), Michael Jai White (The Last Seen in Sci Fi flop "Spawn"), and "Survival of the Games", William MacNamara (who is involved in the only funny half of the entire movie!) Falls to this low level for employment. If you're a fan of Jerry, then you stay on his television show because it's a half hour loss. After I finished this session, I managed to catch the last half hour from Rocky 5 on TV, which, in comparison, seemed like a cinematic masterpiece, I think it says more than enough! <br /> <br />
