Wow. Simply horrible. I was a fan of the original movie and I saw in Part 2, 3 and Improvement. 4.5 and Freddy's dead were pretty bad. But Nothing is as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy acts as a host Rod Serlingesq from this series of anthologies. I can accept how Freddy became a punk after another, but at least in the movies, Freddy's appeal took the movies, but here they were so bad, they looked like high school productions. Poor actors, if you really want to tell you that after doing this show, it was obviously exactly what they paid. I'm pretty sure it was a stop for two types of actors. Those who had just begun to enter the Hollywood scene were newborns willing to take any part to realize they had to get their porn, they were offered last week, or the actors airliners on their way to the Hollywood ladder, were forced to take that pornographic job they were offered last week. Halfway I expected Dana Plato to be a guest, but she was already dead since she was in production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase Nancy's line in the original Elm St, "What do you want to try not to fall asleep following this?"
