For starters; it is very dilettantic to try to describe history only in the positions of weapons, germs and steel. The same thing tried to make Marxists from economic positions. The reason for Western success can not only be luck, the benefits of domesticated plants and animals. We see that any advantages and bonuses across the world are completely useless if they are not wisely managed. There are no huge natural resources in Japan, but Japan is one of the world's largest economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with high oil resources, there is only a low average success. Both nations have and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond said it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, germs and steel to understand. Perhaps the main factor of global difference is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? Mental ability to understand. And in this case, geography is subordinate.
