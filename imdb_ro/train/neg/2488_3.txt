What an incomprehensible misery of a movie. Something about a cop who extracts bullets from him after being shot and holds them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the jar on which he was shot now fifty times) and a top secret custody tank of five or six incompetent soldiers who, for some reason, drive it to Mexico. Whether they were deliberately sent there, whether they were lost, it's never clear. And you will never hear another scenario feature, the word "logs." Gary Busey tries Mel Gibson's role in "Lethal Weapon," and while Busey is a utilitarian actor, the script destroys the entire film at mediocrity. William Smith made another tower as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in Red Dawn a few years earlier. After playing hard for the biker for most of the 70s, he was pretty nice to see him widen the game by playing communist games. Unfortunately, he will always be best remembered as the guy Clint Eastwood has beaten in "In any way you can."
