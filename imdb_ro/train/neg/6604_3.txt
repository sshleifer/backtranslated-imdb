The first one was the best. The second sucks because the dialogue was terrible. Though, the story was not so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I gave it a few times. I know Jackie Chan is a great expertise in martial arts, but not a good actor in Ora Rush 2. Chris Tucker was also not good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, a terrible action (But this is based on her screenplay). All the characters there were not that good. But some of the things I like in Ora 2 Rush are always the less sexual actions and scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do those things that are good for him.
