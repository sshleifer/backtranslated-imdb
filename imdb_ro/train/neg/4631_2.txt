Although Misty Ayers (striptease burlesque) is definitely appealing to the blond lead, this blow is just an excuse to let her go down to the underwear several times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was made, not 1965 )> <br /> The guy who hires her to work in a brothel resembles Bud Abbott de Abbott & Costello. Most other women are unattractive, and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way. A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvable physique, but you can not judge because the movie ENTIRE is post-doubled. Some of these "exploitative films", usually made later than this, are interesting in a way, but this is indeed a fest fest. Sid Melton (MAKE CAMERA FOR DADDY) directed. There are facial expressions like interesting samurai and suites, but there is nothing here.
