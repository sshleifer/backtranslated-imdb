Note that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not wear it. However, I really want to say something about it. In fact, I'm doing research for the university Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to point out that the person on whom their main character was based was, in fact, completely different! Hollywood's ideas about people and the artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke completely approved hysterectomies to cure women's madness and never practiced as freely as presented in the film. I think it's ridiculous to see different film critics writing for legitimate newspapers saying that this movie has a historical background! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Do not waste time with a movie with such anxiety about the horror that real women have experienced in the hands of this doctor who was now glorified by the cinema industry.
