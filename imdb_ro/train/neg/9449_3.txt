Dr. Seuss would have gone mad now if he were alive. Cat in Hat realizes how film productions can take a classic story and turn it into a pile of hollows. We have Mike Myers as the infamous cat in Hat, a big mistake! Myers proves he can not act in this movie. She behaves like a little girl with a thousand tricks in her sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere between the boring and annoying lines. The story is the same as the original with a pair of tricks and most movies based on other stories never change with the original story! Bringing to the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who would never get alive. This movie is like a comic strip denied by the newspaper if you think about it. The film certainly looks sticky! Of course, there is a funny joke for adults, such as when tail cuts and census cut off before saying a naughty, funny word. At least Grinch said and the movie was actually good! This film is a piece of bait with bright colors and a mediocre action. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What's wrong with that stupid fish! The first time you see it, it's real fish. The next time you see it, it's all animated and talked. But he looks like a piece of dough dough dough! This movie is a total wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I am surprised that he even had good jokes, such as water park joke ride, it was good. So, please, if you can choose, watch Grinch instead of misery.
