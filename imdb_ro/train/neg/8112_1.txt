Hanna-Barbera sucks life from another famous property. Violence is watered, stories are formal, animation is bad, music is unpleasant and repetitive, and, honestly, the show is not funny. At that time, HB put everyone in his series, in the same clich√© situations, whether it fits the cartoon world or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as caves ("Hey! Popeye is popular and Flinstones are popular, put them together and you can not miss!"). Also in an apparent ripples of "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and Goon have a regular segment that portrays them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding to annoying factor are public service ads in each episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye teaches my nephew about the safe passage of the street, recycling and - are you ready for that? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I do not do that.) The only charm left out of the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice in the early days, continues to play here. <Br /> <br /> It is worth checking once to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
