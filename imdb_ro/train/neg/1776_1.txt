This movie has its side of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. True, most of the films based on the king's works are bad enough, but that goes far beyond the horrible. There is no scary moment in it unless you take into account scary stupidity. It's typical King's garbage - twisted myths around it that did not make sense first, mixed with the so-called "scarecrows," the so-called "scarecrows," which are as shocking as the Playhouse PeeWee (which, at least, is fun). It's full of ridiculous moments, no less the character of Alice Krige. When she goes into violence and starts singing like a bastard in an old show at Batman, it's so absurd that it's bad. All those who had cameos in this (including John Landis) are fortunate enough to have a career. But the most absurd part must be the cat's costumes to the end, which look like cheap rubber suits bought from K-Mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of real cats that do not actually act in the movie.
