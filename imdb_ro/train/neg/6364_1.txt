Absolute garbage, war scenes worse than a 20-year old hunting movie or an American ninja, etc. Terrible attitude, not an ability to look in the whole movie, like a turn of wood sculptures. /> <br /> Watch it just for how bad this movie is, maybe it was acceptable in the 80's, but this is a 2006 movie, I do not have much love for this movie because it was not born in the 80s . If you like real-life flicks, then check out tony jaa in ong bak and protector, these are the appropriate martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Have a laugh and watch this today, it's possible to see unintentional humor at how serious it is.
