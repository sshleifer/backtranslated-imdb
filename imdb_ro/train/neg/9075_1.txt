The Slackers, named in this film, are the three colleagues Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel) who are about to graduate from the university without taking an honest examination but ending successfully. This goes on until the end of the year, when it's no wonder, but the most enjoyable character in the movie, Nathan (Schwartzman), realizes what they have to do. Nathan starts blackmailing to deal with a dream girl as he does not follow him under normal circumstances. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with Angela (James King) gorgeous and well. Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant genre. Schwartzman makes to watch the movie slightly that his performance is brilliant. The king's performance is average, I think she was only engaged to be around with her superb looks. The Slacker reminds American Pie with a different direction. The banks are as superficial as American Pie. But are not all used? I think this movie is a warning to the directors of the genre that they do not enjoy the originality. In general, a few moments of smile, but a horrible film about acting (except Schwartzman) and the subject. * of *****
