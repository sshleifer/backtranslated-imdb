There are two types of musicians from the 1950s. First you have MGM shiny productions with great names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second-rate directors. "The girl can not help him" belongs to the last category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous, and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it does not matter. It seems that each decade has Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. Indeed, the plot is thin as a razor blade and can not claim it's mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others from rock acts of the 1950s appearing in the film. If this music attracts your attention, it is worth watching. If not, do not bother.
