This gives some of the plot, by the way. A Christmas Charlie Brown is one of those timeless classics that teaches you the value of Christmas and enjoy your holiday. However, no. Trying to capture the excitement of Christmas Charlie Brown, there is even another Christmas song, but it does not succeed with a light and easy joke. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the Christmas spirit, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean (25-dollar gloves ... what?). Sally's sister is the most annoying character in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason she must be in her letter), so she decides to name Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. Sally also plays an angel game with one word: "Hark!" She says instead, hockey stick (grace grace). If Sally says of hack 12 times (all weird sounds exactly the same) does not kill you, nothing will. Mint Patty and Marcy are a focal point, but hardly do it better. Marcy is fun with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. It sounds like a boy (who does not waste rumors) and gets angry when the sheep are in the game (terrible boys and all). It seems she is the sheep every year and is worried she will forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so concerned that she mentions it twice, one after the other, and receives the same answer. I suppose I need to have short term memory loss or something like that. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus has annoying tips), but it's hard to get to the air for a long time. I'm sure Schroeder is not really about that. On the whole, trying to be a parasite to the original, but compromising the message for some quick laughs.
