You know that you have problems when John Cassavetes operates halfway rather than accelerating in a movie and Incubus is a terrible scenario, the worst case of a big actor who goes through the bills to pay bills. In fact, observing Hammy's scenario and John Hough's "Baroque" art, you can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a series of rape killings that take place in a small town with lots of mixed supernatural hokum. Somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetes seems PO visible at times. Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well made creation, but it is not worth the wait.
