((NB: Spoiler Warning, Like!)) First of all, this is a slave teen movie - the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs put it. If you are looking for Roshambo, this is not and was not going to be. I am desperately unimpressed by his cinematic, film, or acting performances. Secondly, this was not Zuniga's first horror movie, it was her first period of appearance, cinema, TV, anything. For what it's worth; nor is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. Third, you must even offer a teardrop props. Of course, he follows the profoundly insulting message of his gender: any young woman who has or is interested in sex is the beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now. Except for this, the sweet, virginal protagonist also! Now is a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage of his beliefs! Interestingly, this role has been declared in the exclusive role of the film. Another Hit One Wonder, except that the term gives too much credit to cowards. <br /> <br /> (Then this movie probably has one of the greatest percentage of actors in a movie in history. A third album has never appeared in another movie, three have appeared in another film of the same producers, just another, besides Zuniga, has at most six credits on the screen, which was and has never been a mutual aid company? <br /> Granted, I have seen this with long ago on the cable late at night when I was bored and never anticipated to be bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt everyone involved and throw them into the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
