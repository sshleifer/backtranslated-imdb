In the future of 1985, a government committee, led by Howard Hesseman, organizes hearings on the first uncensored television network. They promise it is programming, which plays as a series of skits. I can call my good skit movies on the one hand without using my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mondo Video" from Mr. Mike. Notice how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason is that this movie is death in cinematic form. None of the skits is fun or even smart. It takes some kind of great ineptitude on the part of filmmakers to get even a laugh out of me. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F Grandpa of the Eye: Dody Dorn goes full front
