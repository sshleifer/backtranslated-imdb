I'm amazed that I actually stayed and looked at this. I like independent movies, horror movies, and the zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga, you have passed a line that should never be passed. I hope the people in this movie have done a great deal to do this, then at least it was not a total loss. You'd never know if you look at her. Script? You're kidding. Acting? I think the trees were too transforming. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a room there. Period. I do not think there was real planning involved in making this film. Such a total loss of time that I will not prolong by commenting on.
