Sometimes doing something strange and contemporary does not always work for the benefit of all. While I admit that the design and concept of the film were quite interesting, the execution of these ideas in a congruent story did not work. This movie was so hidden and meaningless, not even Robin Williams could save that garbage. It's obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about it.
