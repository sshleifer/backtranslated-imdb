"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared into the Peruvian Amazon, a year later he left the jungle ... empty and took 45 years to come back." It's supposed to "keep the river on the right" is "a modern cannibal story." In reality, anyone looking for an understanding of cannibalism will unfortunately be disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a travel journal of New Ginuea, mostly native art. The second half is based on photographs of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but it really is about it. If, of course, you are not interested in the home movies of a Jewish wedding, or by Schneerbaum introducing your male lovers. I give up. Great disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal story". - MERK
