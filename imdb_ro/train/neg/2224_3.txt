I saw the first time I was 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what was happening. Apparently, 15 years later, I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that the writers have never surpassed the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoons. There is no character development, no story back, no character arch, nothing. Good boys do things because they're good, while bad boys do things just because they're bad. An unintentional hilarious part is when someone you think is important dies and nobody cares at least. They just shrugged and continued. Almost no dialogue. If you eliminate combat scenes and running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. Watch this because you want to see a good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to look at hot, expensive cartoon chicks (or cartoon boys).
