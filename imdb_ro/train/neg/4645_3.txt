Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a big villain - see Sharky's car, but here he is clearly named and for this reason he lacks the usual charisma). He goes to the most expensive places in Paris and Marseille, asks for names, beats people, gets names, goes to more attractive places, calls for more names, knocks more people, etc. The whole movie is the punch after the punch. It seems that those who did it had no ambition but to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 years old here, is doing good stunts at first; Besides, "Le Marginal" is a film of a violent, episodic, ludicrous, profound and forgetful cop. (* 1/2)
