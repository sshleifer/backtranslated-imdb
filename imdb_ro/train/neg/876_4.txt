Until the last 20 minutes, I thought this was Jackie Chan's worst movie (except for his 1978 work that I'm not familiar with). The last sequence of battle has changed all this: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the strengths of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to stay in a lot of "comedies" that could amuse kids for five years (oh, somebody dropped a tomato in front of that guy) and countless football scenes. Not to mention dubbing (which includes the "How can I deactivate it? It's not a tap" line - watch to find out what it's about). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for final battle alone, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie collectors, and even then for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
