This movie lost me with an RPG weapon. It was as if someone cut and stuck a scene from Robocop. I expected Beowulf to say exclamation "I like it!" I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV show "The Dead Zone," and he played his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least kept it consistently for the whole movie - unlike any of his cost. They continued to sink in all kinds of speech from ancient English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. However, even on their own, the plot of this film is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget does not excuse. Having a low budget means you have at least one good story, dialogue and decent action. These things do not cost much. Instead, they spent their money on the CGI in half and decent sets and suits. Life is too short to watch this movie.
