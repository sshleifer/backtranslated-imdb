"Smokey and the Bandit" was not really Shakespeare, but then no one wanted to be. He was a knocker, but he had brains. He had a very clever script, with definite characters and funny fun. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not offer any of these. There is no reason to smile. If it should be a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them lazy, giving them only choreographic choreographies and one of the slightest leaping cars I've ever seen. Everything seems to be fake, filming badly for purposes. Perhaps Sally Field (as a girlfriend who squeezes her hands on the edge) has the weakest role, without a single funny or intelligent line ("If you do that, I will not be here when you get back"). Burt Reynolds continues to look at the room and close his eyes, but joking is on any audience that's in Hooper. * from ****
