I caught this in a screening test. All I can say is: What ... hell? This movie plays as well as Mickey Mouse reading the script for Scarface. It's bizarre beyond making the smallest sense; and even if you do not leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. Plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile containing a CIA test. The CIA comes after Irwin to take the probe back, Irwin mistakes them for poachers and decides to "stop them". It's about the whole story that exists; the rest is a top battle of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strange choreographed sequences of choreography. At one point, Irwin mounts a RV with speed and struggles with a CIA agent knife. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin's knife fights a guy on a RV. Let him be your guide to this ridiculously bad movie.
