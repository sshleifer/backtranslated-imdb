I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, indeed. Unfortunately, I always find it hard to stop a movie once I start seeing it. Especially when it's so classic or what people use to call a classic. I think this is one of those movies that every movie lover should have watched at least once, so I've seen it. Do not get me wrong, I love Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's wife both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big scam in my opinion. There is not a very good plot, no spy filming, no romantic romance. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both genres. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was not known whether "Bogey" and Bacall would stay together at the end or away from each other. I think "To have and do not have" is very overestimated and Bogart was in many better movies in the 1940s.
