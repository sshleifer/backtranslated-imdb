I saw this movie "hot" when it came out in 1986. She had an X rating for a short scene involving oral sex, but she played in table theaters (it was an "artistic" movie). It seems to be the first film ever to show a respected actress in an explicit sexual scene. What I saw was a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As I mentioned earlier, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body, but it also has a very good performance. Pitzalis was (quite easily) rather poor. No wonder he never made another movie. However, despite the infamous sexual scene (which is explicit but rather short), this is a slowly moving story that bored me. The good that acts by Detmers helped only a certain point. For the most part, I looked at my watch waiting patiently to finish. If he did not have that sequence, this movie would have been forgotten a long time ago. Tough and slow. You can skip this.
