I'm not alone to admire the first Superman movie, a film Richard Donner has done with craftsmanship. Also, I'm not alone in Richard Lester's Superman 2 scare ... that brings Richard Donner to the same movie, unfortunately it's still absolute abomination. Superman's world is one where suspending unbelief is needed in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first student. In a sense, there is no plot because the characters do not have the motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, the power of Superman (or his lack) is treated in a slightly credible manner. There is too much to criticize, so I do not mind. I've condemned this movie ... maybe Lester's paper is better suited to the moronic script on which this film is based. Super-Duper bad.
