... but it certainly is not without merit. Preston Sturges has already experienced unusual cinematic effects in telling stories, creating well-characterized and distinctive characters and situations, and writing intelligent, sometimes unexpected, wise and compassionate dialogue. (It's no surprise that the next film of the Coen brothers will be a tribute to Sturges.) The major problem is that the story is not that far out there; He misses surprises, unexpected upheavals, and sudden changes in luck that prevent viewers from guessing. The slogan for coffee is a terrible thing to hang up with the plot, and the end is fully predictable. Frank Capra does this much better. If you are new to Preston Sturges, first check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek." If you've already seen this, then go ahead and watch it.
