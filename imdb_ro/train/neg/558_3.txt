It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone gave the audience a footpath that overturned the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, he's back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the erotic "Basic Instinct" with a sexy stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, the fans of the original could not even approach this movie, because "Instinct 2" is a painful film because mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones assassinated the first film's legacy. <br /> <br /> The movie begins when a car explosion breaks in the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy) is a suspect and seems to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is called to examine it, but ultimately falls for an intimate seduction game. And there is, without further explanation, the basic force that moves this "Instinct." Nothing is explained and we have to stand in a classic erotic movie C. Sharon Stone plays the main role in which she is most of the time a part of it because of amateur writing, negligence, and low-terrifying chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a scene cut has been cut so that it is not "Instinct" is a convincing torture. First of all, what made the original movie a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the movie, acting here is very bad. David Morrisey plays the worst role of his life and never seems to make more than two expressions in the film - confused and excited. "Instinct 2" est it's a horrible way to continue a different original series that has managed to put the thriller with eroticism extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you ... "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and indeed it is not. Some movies should not get out of paper, and that's the feeling you get after watching that. Now it's much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg have given up and why Sharon Stone expected a huge salary for this ...... .- 3/10
