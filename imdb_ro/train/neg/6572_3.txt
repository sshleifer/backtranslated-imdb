In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed from "Only brave" to "All About Lane". I went to seeing this movie a few months ago and I was rather disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate the fact that the director made a 442-year-old film - a subject that deserves much time to appeal to the film industry - the action in some parts of the film was pretty eternal. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director should not have been the main character in the film. I'm sorry, Lane, you're not just a film actor. Stick to what you are good at theater. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this movie was also horrible. She should never have been given a speech role, and her appearance was inappropriate to play the role of Queen Nisa's queen. There were other young actresses in the movie who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why was not the role cast? Another major issue with this film was its action sequences. Japanese-American soldiers do not show that they were fighting German soldiers ... not to mention anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since it was a war-based film, is it not important to show some battle in fact? This movie was a dignified attempt, but certainly does not deserve a major distribution.
