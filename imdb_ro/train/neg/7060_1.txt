this movie is terrible. Characters are completely incredible and inconsistent. The terrain is terrible, and some of the scenes in the classroom are very valuable and make uncomfortable views. In fact, the quality of the script and the characterization would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the lack of credibility towards the school environment would suggest that the writers did not actually go to high school. The action in most cases was also poor, although many of them were accompanied by a stupid and plot scenario, I'm not sure the actors could have done this movie. He said the sound was OK, and the cinema was enjoyable in places (although the editing was poor).
