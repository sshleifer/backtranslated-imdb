I find it hard to understand why this piece of garbage has been repackaged. The only salvific grace of the whole thing is Ariauna's body in her sexy uniform. And her humor must be appreciated. It is a plus, but unfortunately it would take a magician to save this garbage. However, it must be positively recognized for her heroic effort and true professionalism. I can not say the same thing to her co-star Lilith with her voice full of gems that hurts your nervous system. She appeared disinterested and gave the impression that her presence on the stage was all she needed. Everyone says that, apart from Ariauna's performance, it is indeed a total garbage.
