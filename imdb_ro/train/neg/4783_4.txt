This is still a bad movie that you should avoid watching. The plot could be more "thick" than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster movie. The act leaves something to be desired, though you can not put your finger on what this is one of those you watch on television late at night, probably in the US, simply because you can not sleep. Look at him if you want, but do not expect too much.
