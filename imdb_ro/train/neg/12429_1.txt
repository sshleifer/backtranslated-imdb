Remembering the filthy details of this insidious vapid "film" is akin to digging a rusty and salty spoon into the chest cavity. Maybe "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit predictable, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most shameless deals on the sale I've ever heard. A boy fighting against spies / terrorists when he is alone at home in a Chicago suburb with varicella? Ridiculous! Why should this film be made? I am the kind of person who think that even terrible movies are not waste of time, but rather learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
