I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about it. is so annoying and stupid. everyone says nat and alex wolff are heroes in the world of music and will make it big. What type of drug do you take ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will end up as hobos or end up like Jane Hudson at "What Happened to Baby Jane?" I only managed to spend 20 minutes of this show, just 30 seconds of the show, and I managed to survive for about half an hour of the Battle of the Lanes. How could someone praise these guys at the Kid's Choice Audience, I have no idea. a few days before Nick's premiere, most of Nick's (Nick Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) actress plays in a business that influences the deadly believed children about how wonderful Nat and Alex Wolff are. first of all, they did not crazy me and secondly, nat and alex probably drugged them or paid a lot of money to say that and convincing sound, because I do not see how anyone could find this show / fun movie. music is terrible. Nat sings sounds like a sick patient, dead on crack. alex is the most annoying EVER movie / TV show. it's not funny, it's annoying, it's very weird and she thinks she's hot and she knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if he ever manages to be put. you know this show is false when you find that some of the characters (in real life) do not even exist! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and his cousin Alex jesse Draper (must have a budget issue). Their father is not alone, he is married to Polly Draper, but she does not appear on the show, making it seem that Wolff has no mother. And Rosalina does not exist. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the Naked Brothers will be in a deep, when their "fans" will find out that everything is staged. 0/10
