Okay, the preview of this movie just tells you that a rebellious young woman is going to live with her grandfather for the summer to get her right. This is not the case! It's a 17-year-old rebellious young woman who reveals a secret, and her mother has to believe whether she's telling the truth or not. To be honest, I really liked the concept of this film. They had a very good plot and a very good theme of a relationship of love / hate between mother and daughter. However, I was not happy to see what actor Lindsay Lohan. In fact, this movie would have been GOOD if someone else had a better actress. The character Rachel (Lohan) is a very aggressive person and reminds us of true Lindsay, so she takes a lot of the film. Still, I think if you put Lindsay aside, you'll enjoy this movie. The end is quite big (and sad).
