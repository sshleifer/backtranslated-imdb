This inferior sequel, based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (producer also), refers to a marriage called Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a monastery. Gene York on the re-election for the congressman and he chairs the finance committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when unexplained death happens. It creates disaster when going to a metaphysical fair, because numerology stores, therapy, healing counseling, yoga, and tarot, among others, are destroyed. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and bizarre events. This continuation of the TV shows creeps, chills, creepy events, and killing gorilla. Delia, like Damien, seems to send out a terrible new crime every few minutes of the movie, which happens with horrible killings. The main emotion is the pursuit of what the new and innocent victim can be made through the special effects of the middle. In addition, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, no matter how handsome they are, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser, and the recent dead Don S Davis, were an army captain turned into acting. As always, excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is intended exclusively for Omen saga hardcore supporters. The film is directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. The earlier and much better versions are the following: Original "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick), exceptional, superior to Richard Donner; "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; "Ultimate Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: Less than average.
