I had to leave the theater. After an hour, all I saw was that people called husbands, schtupping like dogs in a routine and using the word f-like a diabetic using Equal. No, thanks. <br /> <br /> It was particularly frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any of the characters could have been quite exciting if they were given more than to do it than to fall apart, talk about it and swear to each other. Several times, to be a kind of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. The development of plots in the first hour can be summed up as 1) more murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the crime scene 3) Vinnie looks repeatedly over the Atlantic / East / Hudson 4) Vinnie cheats on his wife and 5) Joey sympathetic in the show) is kicked out of his parents' house. Moreover, I did not expect to see. The photo and interaction between the characters were superb, but they were NOT for them. The floods of sex and vulgarity do not deserve to wait an hour longer for something to happen. Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
