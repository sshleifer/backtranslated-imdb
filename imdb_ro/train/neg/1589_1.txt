It is unbelievable that a scenario as a clich√© and completely absurd could make any screen even the smallest. The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmless role of the bad ass, Elvis borrows, throws his head, the martial arts master playing in the life of a former soccer player who has become a gambling addict played by NBC's "Star Next Action" . Its performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. "The Movie" takes place in Vegas and, since people are playing poker, the writers considered it a perfect setting for a movie about a guy who is trying to survive for 24 hours against an ubiquitous and rich player who has targeted his target 2 , 4 million dollars do it during the day. And so does the pursuit. A hunt of unprepared bursts of hunting, sets of construction yards, unmoved cinema and a single line containing the word "bet" or "gamble". The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry fans "NAS", the losers make their memorable homes too. The end of the surprise will hit your stockings if you like predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should re-evaluate his decision to sell more. I would like to give me the two hours of my life back.
