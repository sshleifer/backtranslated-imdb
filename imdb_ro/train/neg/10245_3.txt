I've been expecting a lot from this movie. Like Lee as a strange character, but in return everything I received was a waste of time and a boring film. I can not even explain this movie. He had a terrible wooden script from the Bible, such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was the end! The rest had to wait and I hope that something significant would happen, but it did not. This film is about a couple who is trying to find the changes that happen in the world, such as places in China where an earthquake occurred, and they reached a monastery led by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery becomes the key to disturbances. The entire movie is abusive and boring. One of Lees is the worst.
