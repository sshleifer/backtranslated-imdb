This movie is very similar to the movie Hostel, unless * BAD * acts and does not sigh. The gore elements are there, but they do not feel anything for the characters, which makes the violence not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like forcing a snake into someone's throat. What's up with that? Should it be frightening or upsetting? It's just stupid. As for torture, there really is none (unless the guy was hit by fires at first, which he does not show). The main evil guy continues to say, "Make them die slowly," but the butcher kills everyone very quickly. Deaths are relatively fast. Yes, I saw the "unrated" version. So, on the whole, not the worst gore film I've seen, but not at all good. You will not lose anything if you skip this.
