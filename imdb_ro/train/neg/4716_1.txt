This show is boring, blades and practically breaks all sorts of different things to make it "original". First of all: the animation is so ugly ... Johnny is hideous ... and everyone is annoying. Gemini looks like Dexter's Dexter's Lab, and Johnny is almost like a smarter Dee Dee man (also from Dexter's Lab). Secondly, parcels ... are painful blades, making them hard to follow. Gags are stiff and nothing makes me feel like laughing ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but the only ones were removed. Third: The entire thematic song begins by breaking the song with Green Day's "American Idiot". And although I'm not a big fan of that band, I find it very bad they will get the same opening song and then they will change it subtly to make their own ideas. The point ... is a big thick fat fat. 1/10
