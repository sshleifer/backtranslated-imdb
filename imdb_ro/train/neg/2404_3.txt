I was disappointed. 1) Adam Arkin is more prostitute than Ross Geller from 'Friends' 2) A great casting is scattered (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. 3) The film suffers from horrible rhythms. It jumps around in a pitiful, confusing way. 4) The story does not even make sense. Why does he want to break football? How about violin music? None of them is explained. 5) It's not even funny. It's like a lot of accountants trying to make improvisation, saying, "Look at me! I look funny!" This was a bad attempt to make another "Love At First Bite". I like Larry Cohen's movies, but man has failed here. I could not wait for the credits to roll. Horror disappointed.
