This is almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the carpet under it for me. The recordings are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa has once been called "cheepnis". It seems that the space scenes were made in an electric power plant in the 1950s, just before demolition. Music is really bleak. The act is made of wood and ham. The characters they portray are superficial and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is obvious immediately and brutally when copying techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of direction required certainty. But you have to see it, just to experience what has to be one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
