He saw her at the tonal festival of the UCSB bobbin and was * shocked * to win the gold coin prize. I was not alone, since the audience had mixed reactions to the play. I thought there were many other better moves there, but I found out that judges were rooted in film theory and other artistic nonsense. While cinema and editing are peer to many other shorts there, the story is nothing more than the usual student piece. It seems that the "serious" student films must include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal fight and eventual suicide - Nick and Kate are stuttering and include all three. Please be more original! Oh, and it could be my opinion from outside, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Is there anything else?
