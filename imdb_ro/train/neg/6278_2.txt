You have to ask yourself how ever they have been mistaken ... it has decided to skip why, among many other things, and simply wanders beyond death. <br /> <br /> And yet, you have a number of decent actors who are doing their best to pump a life in the story. The blue hue of the film goes beyond "once again", which, by itself, would be depressing, but here is too much. The idea that it is not a medical condition, not a church or a villain or a curse, but just something that, for no apparent reason, begins to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone around him, an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have super powers, but others do not know or do not know they do it? Looks like we're as clueless as we are. It's a "wild" rip-off of "Snatchers Body Invasion" with "Mirror" and "Sixth Sense" by Keifer Sutherland, you were to beat the three together.
