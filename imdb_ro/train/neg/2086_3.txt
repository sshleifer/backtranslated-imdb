Ivan Reitman is something to save. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come alive in his skilled hands. Even the occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that make it worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman failed to take a fairly original story (the superhero for man, the superhero becomes vengeance powered by super power) and turn it into a pleasant thing. "Girlfriend" is an exercise of futility. The pony park with a single trick is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it will be a romantic comedy or a super heroic drama. The result is a flip-flop film between both, without any very good looks. Uma Thurman is on top, as usual, and Luke Wilson withdrew his role, though his weaker ancients quickly become tired. What's more crazy is that in certain scenes (such as when a very overturned Uma knocks a wall head against a wall), you feel that a spiritual, raucous opit, practically screaming to come out. But seconds later, magic is lost, disappearing as fast as the superhero, whose films disappoint almost in all respects.
