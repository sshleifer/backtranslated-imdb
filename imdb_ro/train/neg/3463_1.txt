I saw this movie last night and I have to say honestly that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The act is correct, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the "energy used to make the movie" and if the movie is burned, the killer will die? How incredible is this? Characters have been underdeveloped to say at least ... for example, suddenly man mentions "Do not try to finish the movie because your mother could not?" So we should go with that? I had no idea she was her daughter until the middle of the movie. The film did not reflect anyone, I did not know anything about the main survivors, except the Ringwald character, she was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director as her mother . Let's not really sink to know who we are. It seems that things have been rushed to kill. The whole plot is totally too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of nonsense obviously has to learn one thing or two about making the film. I can not believe anyone would agree to stay or even work on this image. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was a clique on the whole movie. I woke up preaching what would happen before each scene, which she thought was not hard to do at all. It's a shame, and I'm sorry I lost an hour and a half looking at the mess. 1/10.
