This is an old-fashioned film that aims to portray the desire of young people for freedom in a dehumanized British school. Oh yes it is like in the army, you will learn to listen and do what you are asked. Yes, the young dream of something else but breaks their dreams and removes their optimism on the brink of life. Excellent. So you can summarize the beautiful intentions in case ... If beautiful intentions that do not cause cinematic challenges: the result is a declamatory film. Have you seen how boring I mean? At least that helped Kubrick to chase McDowell into A Clockwork Orange, a movie with a truly powerful satire and no self-indulgent sentimentality.
