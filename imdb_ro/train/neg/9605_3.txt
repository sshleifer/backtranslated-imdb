This Italian film of the '70s is NOT even in class with dog soldiers, The Howling or even with that American wizard in Paris, but ... it's fun to look. I'm talking about pursuing the lead actress, an amazing blonde, running in her costume. We talk about graphic nudity, complete ... it is obvious that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma! The story is a hohot, SFXs are childish, and those that act (mostly) move. The only redeeming value of this movie is (and there is a LOT) scenes of nudity and sex. Improving HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a meeting on Saturday night. OK ... HERE THE SPOILER ... There is no werewolf (except for the opening scene of the heroine ancestor.) The girl just thinks she is a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
