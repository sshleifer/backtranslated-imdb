There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than, say, small monsters or scary dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, indeed. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he catches his wife cheating him with the foot of the pool that he hits, he brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, give a crazy dentist an exercise and a mouth, and you can probably guess what's going on ... As I said, a brilliant idea, but it was not delivered as it should. In particular, the end is a huge disappointment. Last note: Watch for Mark Ruffalo (you can rely on me, the eternal sun ...) in this. 5/10.
