It's sad when you can see what's trying to make a movie and it's pretty obvious that it's fallen far beyond the brand. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. A graduate has an idea. He wants total control. Thus, he writes, directs, produces, the kinematic masterpiece by himself. Its concept usually exceeds the budget. He usually writes an exaggerated script full of every line of tags he can come up with. He is usually more interested in the big hit of the story, rather than the noise of working with actors on individual scenes. He usually ends up with a poor film in his attempt to create miracles on a small budget. It usually ends with a series of meetings (we can not do justice by calling them scenes) that look like they were written by a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with heavy-acting scenes that can not catch the spectator. When you look at judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it's just the usual tariff.
