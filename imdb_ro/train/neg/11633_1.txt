If I could give Zero stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give one ... There is no single scene I could laugh at ... but the game did not make me laugh either. So if you are a badly delayed people, go to the local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have done. But for me ... in a movie where kids are shot to get humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! PLEASE WAIT TO KEEP YOU FROM MORE FILMS !!!!!
