Wow. I do not even remember much about this movie, except for being embarrassed. the parents of a parent neglects her, so this Pokemon claims herself to be her father. Am I the only one disturbed by this? Then this strange PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to claim to be the face of the girl. I do not care if she tries to make her happy girl, it's rude. There was no real plot. The girl was just a little boy who wanted things like her. She played with Unowns, she was Ente's "daughter", and she seems to be able to grow older and shrink on a whim with her "father". That's all I remember, but I think you can take it as a suggestion and not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect too much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Really. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon, the first movie".
