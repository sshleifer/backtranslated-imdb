Was anyone editing this movie? Or was it just the launch of the DVD that had thirty huge decades between scenes? It's ok, though, I fell asleep watching her for the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. Crying is not really the worst I've seen, but it's close. The actor is not the worst I've seen ... but he's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say it was the worst I've ever seen in my life! Do not try to be bad, but Unhinged could have used some more production. Please do not think I'm a hater of horror films or even I did not like this movie. I felt like laughing at the movie much more than I felt I was laughing at myself. The terrible moments were not too bad, but they could have been made better even with an impressive budget. Characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored together, the end of the twist was bad enough, and the exposure lasted forever without exposing much. I would recommend avoiding this movie. 1/10
