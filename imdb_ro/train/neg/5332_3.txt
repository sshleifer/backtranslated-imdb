OK, the portrait of the stereotyped "Indians" in this story is simply BACK. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, the color of the skin seems to change during the movie. I was thinking, OK, ... that he was never HELPED in real life. They are some of the most obvious "Indian" makeup puppets I've ever seen. It's just as bad as the "Indians" on the "F-Troop" and the old West Hollywood that have been interpreted by American Jewish and Italian actors and not native Americans! story and mediocre songs, as in all subsequent Elvis movies. He just did it, because Colonel Parker left him tied to long-term contacts to get as much money out of Elvis as possible! I still think "thank God" that Elvis has ceased to make movies forever not long after this movie came out. It's great to see the character characters Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie, though. Burgess Meredith's Indian makeup is absolutely AWFUL. It's the worst of bunches for sure. What were the film's thinkers? Did Mr. Meredith do that just for money or what? But I like some Elvis movies. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I can even stop watching his movie with future television co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Change of Habit," in which Elvis plays a doctor from the surrounding city. Well, at least Elvis did some good movies, but the mediocre and the bad ones remain the overwhelming and the good ones. I will always love ELVIS! Thank you very much!
