I would not be so quick to look at all good reviews and say that it could be a good show. This show is good only if you do not know what "talent" is ... I will not even say how offensive it's (I know it can be offensive for a lot of people) because that's not what bothers me about the show .. What bothers me is that people follow this and I think it's funny ... It makes me I feel like our generation is getting stupid and I'm afraid that someday it'll be driven by people who follow this trash. Actually, the plot is simple ... it's about an offensive, Silvermen) going through the day with day. That's it. It's not like a million times. In fact, almost every joke was made or racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing .. I like her voice .. that's not lyrics .. Lyrics are awful .. who likes to sing about many things .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a hot woman put everyone down and make me feel like shit while at the same time farting and saying shit about every race then this show is for you ..
