Dumb is just as bad in this black comedy, supposedly black. In essence, what begins with Chris Klein trying to keep a low profile, eventually turns into an uninspired version of "the three amigo" without any laughter. For the black comedy to work, it must be scandalous, which "Play Dead" is not. For the black comedy to work, it can not be a spirited spirit, which is "Play Dead". Play Dead is a city full of jobs. Fred Dunst makes a fairly accurate imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character in "A Simple Plan," while Jake Busey makes a pretty fair imitation, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
