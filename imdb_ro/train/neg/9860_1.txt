I usually enjoy movies like this. It's documentary, but the act and the writing are just awful. The act is wooden and rigid, and writing is so clich√©, but not at all in a good way. From typing this, I'm surprised it's at a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I'm sure most of these votes must have come from the people in the movie. I suppose if so, you can do some laughs, because it's always funny seeing your relatives / friends making a movie. Well, in a way, I think this gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do it, you can do it. Although, maybe it should not.
