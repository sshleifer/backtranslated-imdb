Wholeheartedly disagree with other spectators of this fucking movie. The only reason I did not appreciate it because it was terrible was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of her singing and her danced. The problem is with the rest of the image. Alice Faye falls fairly empty. Don Ameche has a great voice to sing, but with the miserable writing material, he collapses so terribly. The plot is really rigid here, where Ameche assumes two parts as a song and dancing man and a baron does not marry happily with Faye. It seems that by singing the song and the dancing man, Ameche's marriage becomes a second change of reincarnation. Some stupid nonsense about the Baron having to discover his business and be far away allows him to play both sides. S.Z. Sakal does not have much to do here, and so his comedy gifts do not have the chance to shine. That's for J. Carrol Naish, who seems to be uncomfortable in his role. This is a chic boom bomb of a movie.
