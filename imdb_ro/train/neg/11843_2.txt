Just because an event really did not mean it will do a good script / movie. The Cat's Meow by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on the real events that took place on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre characters than taking the time to create a story for bizarre characters to live. The key moments of the story seem unlikely; for example, when Hurst accidentally shot the producer, believing he was Chaplin. Putting a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is common and controversial. The story is trying to be a dark comedy, but Cat's Meow omitted an important piece of this comedy equation. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It does not really matter who is shot, who is murdered, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to cheer on. As a result, conflicts are difficult to take care of and the eventual outcome is incidental.
