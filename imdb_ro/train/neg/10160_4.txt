A typical blow from Lanza, who had a limited public appeal with a weak story line that was simply put to justify Lanza MGM's contract at that time. As Lastliberal member (above) reported, Grayson could not resist Lanza's obscene progression to her camera (and sometimes even her). In addition, his chill manners and the constant smell of alcohol on their face during the scenes they were doing together were intolerable. After making their second (and last) film "The Toast of New Orleans," did Grayson normally enter Louie B. Mayer's office and tell him without any doubt that he will never work with Lanza again? period. Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM, then to Lanza, so Grayson's statement was blocked. Grayson continued to play in a number of highly accepted (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when I asked her to compare Lanza and Keel, her answer was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great to work and had much more appeal to the "real people" in the audience .
