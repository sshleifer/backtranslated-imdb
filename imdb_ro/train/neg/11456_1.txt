This is one of those movies that makes you think: would it be Hulk "The real American" Hogan did the same? Frankly, I do not believe and was right. I am Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have played with another team (for example, French) simply because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition to her protagonist, she does not fall in love with a British girlfriend at the end of the film, but with a wife mate, why hunt with Yale. In terms of acting, all players act very badly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of "the dead society of the poets." Actually, that's another movie I hate.
