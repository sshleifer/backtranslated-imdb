I do not think I'm too far from the bottom saying that this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I've worked on a list of my favorite war films: "The Longest Day," "In Hell and Back," "The Kwai Bridge" (all black and white), all of them having good plots, great action. I saw a better dialogue and I played in a high school act written by a student. However, the plot is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of a traffic accident, though, I could not stop it! A movie does not need big money or great sets, that is, "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so budget is not an excuse. What did they think?
