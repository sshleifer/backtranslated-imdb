I simply do not understand why all these relics of Ceausescu's age refuse to give up. It can be clearly seen how frustrated they were during the censorship of the commission, which forbid so many things to show them in their films and now imagines its dunno that much of the fartsy artistic freedom fills the screen with people who are defiling, urinating, swearing, and any other kind of hydodes that can be imagined. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and neorealism, and other filmmakers who have been able to work with ugly aesthetics. These people have mastered their jobs - well, no! Give us a favor, all of you Daneliuc and Nicolaescu and Saizescu and Muresan and Marinescu and Marginean and other old ones, and leave us alone! His time to see on screen some Romanian films, enough with your immature terribilihood! You are not executives, you are ILLITERATED !!!
