After, behind George, he had great hope for this move. Major disappointment. Thread empty plot, bad action, bad visual effects. This movie was based on a single-line blade, an idiotic (and useless) placement of products and the easiest side impact of that gadget object. I took two young children to see him, and they got bored of their minds. The only laugh received from this movie was bad waiting since when they needed a laugh look a guy who put him in the bust!
