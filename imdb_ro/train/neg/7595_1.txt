"Ask the Dust" looked interesting from the trailer and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the film was not convincing enough to be considered a drama and it was not fun enough to be a comedy. Practically it seemed to satirize and have no fun effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this to improve, my wife and I went out, considering we did not waste time with such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It seems they were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse, it was such a waste of waste by extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
