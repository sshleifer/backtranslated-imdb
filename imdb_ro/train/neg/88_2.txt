I looked very much at this movie. It's a good family movie; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better editing job, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But if another is done, I ask them to take care of editing. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other films of the series were wonderful. I like the story of Willie and Missy; both are very successful models. In addition, the romantic side of the audience always enjoys a good love affair.
