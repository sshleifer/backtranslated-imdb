... the child's actors were annoying. It also appears that the producers on this film were struggling to fill for 90 minutes. Scenes of serious death, though. If not for death scenes, this movie would have a very disney sensation. <br /> <br /> The child's main protagonist did not seem as scared as it should have been. If I were in the middle of the forest with a smiling smile like smile, you could bet your ass that I had not strayed around and riding my bike. In general, I've seen worse (that is, expecting), but there is nothing to look again, or recommend that someone bothers you unless you are an avid horror collector.
