Even if it was a production made for television, there is absolutely no excuse for the bottom results of the finished product. This movie had a budget and had a casting department, so if you make a movie about a true story of life and actually put the "true story" in the title, you should not try to try do you capture a realism? First of all, this film is absurd. These actors belong to television soaps during the day or in those ridiculous movies on the Lifetime channel, and not in a gangster / criminal story. Everything about them, from their looks to their manners, only the cries of the 90-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening generation. What about the script? Two words describe it - silly and insulting, and again it sounds too much. I do not think the real Clyde Barrow ever said the words "I'm out of here." It's like a bunch of fans of "New Kids on the Block" gathered and decided to make a real "move" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would have been total and bad. Well, this sticker does not even fit on the rad and rockin ladder. Everything that may be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong here, from casting and acting to editing and music. Everything is wrong wrong ... and is angry that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey have had the courage to put the "true story" in the title. Surely this is not the real story, but even worse, it's not fun at all like a blow of mindless popcorn, which is accepted in its terms. As I said in my head, it is simply horrible beyond words, at all levels imaginable. Trust me or look at your own risk.
