This is a strange kind of movie, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and struggles against Satan and his minions ... but it's still quite fun. It has some authentic laughter .. if all were intended, it is certainly questionable. This movie is not good, but I can say I was very happy to see it. I would recommend this movie over "Santa Claus conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
