This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. But it was dragged, it had characters untouchable, and it did not have a public target. Some children go into a space camp and are accidentally launched into space by a robot friend of theirs (properly called Jinx). The ladders of the space are then long, repetitive (the same crash happens twice) and either scary or frightening, depending on your point of view. Adults will get bored and tear, children may be scared, because the way they were filmed leaves a wonderful sense of it. There is a story of pride, but unlike the ship - this is never done. Why is included first is unclear, except you can add extra tension between characters - but failed if that was the idea. A young Leo Thompson should be weird and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is great. But no, she was irritating and revealing. No one you want to meet, you have as a friend or even a model model. Joaquin Phoenix? It's really lucky to have this show again in the movies. Maybe he can behave like Mikey in Life Cereal ads, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It does not fit on the screen and I do not think we can identify with him at home. In fact, he would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
