The mother's grave begins with a review of mother's events and then moves the story a few years ago and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and mummy Kharis started to do harm and revenge on those who broke the tomb in the past . While I absolutely loved the "mummy" with Boris Karloff as Immotep mummy and liked "mother's hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is directly prequel to this film), I was not as taken with "The Mummy's Tomb ". It is made in a style similar to the previous movie and has a parcel somewhat similar, even if in a new frame. Lon Chaney Jr is okay like Kharis, but it does not really differ. And I think it is my main criticism of this film - that nothing stands out. There's nothing terrible here, but no really remarkable thing, so the viewer is left with a pretty mummy story.
