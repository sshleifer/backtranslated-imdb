What piece of junk this movie was. The premise was fine, but even at first with crappy effects of mixing into a giant with people of normal size (even the effects of Hercules were better), I knew it would be bad. But the very horrible part of the film is dialogue. He is completely incoherent, stupid and stupid. I felt it was written by a grade 9 in the creative class and got a D-. I want to push Casper van Diem and the other actors to watch this movie. I have had brick and bad movies (I like the series of shakes), but ... they do not recommend it at all. It's silly, and the bad conversations will make you overturn.
