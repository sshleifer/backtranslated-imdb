I've written reviews for several of MoH's episodes, and this is one of the worst. Interesting preoccupation at the beginning is completely abandoned by the moment the credits roll down. If you look at things you would never have amused in real life ("to examine the basement!"), Then this is your show. However, it is not fun or fun - it's just annoying. Expansion of the virus is never, he has ever shown. I can not overlook the fact that it affects only men, because the resulting situation is very, very scary. But then things get damaged as the daughter leaves my dad to become home and eventually dies in his hands. The woman runs north and passes through dozens of situations. Then comes a kind of spirit or stranger or something that saves her (things that make you go?). Or something. Then she is crammed for heat. End. <br /> <br /> Great. These directors send this tribute by mail.
