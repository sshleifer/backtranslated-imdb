This is a very sad film. Really. Nothing is happening in this movie. The script is bad! I think they just copied the first 15 pages to 90 pages. Producers must have thought about creating a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not make it. Now, in the third week, it is only held in Antwerp and in Brussels at 22.45. In the past, we had very good films in Belgium, like Daens. Tints are a waste of your time. Maybe you could slip into the theater after you saw a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen everything. He was dying to local radio and television. I hope it will soon disappear into Shades.
