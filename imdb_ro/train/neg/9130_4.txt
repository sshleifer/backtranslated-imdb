It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers may be disappointed with this, his last action. But, surely, any fan of the sellers will find delight in all of his films, simply because of the immense talent of man. and Dr. Fu Manchu's Fiendic Plot is certainly not an exception. Unfortunately, this will prove to be the last film of the vendors (even released after his death), but it is nice to see how he managed to retain his irreplaceable talent until his early resignation. Not only do we get a seller, but we get to it, because sellers play not only the main role, but also his nemesis, bizarre Nayland Smith, the 168-year-old Fu hunter detective. The story is just as unusual as we follow Fu's scandalous antics to make his age-defying elixir, and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to hinder it. Like any of the bigger vendors' movies, the film comes with impeccable guaranteed performance from him, as well as many of his familiar co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren, for to name a few. It's also nice to see Burt Kwouk (Cato) from Pink Panther, who enjoys a cameo with Sellers - although he plays the same but still beautiful. The story is really quite ridiculous, like many of the characters involved, who classify this movie under Goon's influence. And, though it never comes to the heights of Goon comedy, there are lots of fun jokes that seem to be heading in the right direction. The film has commercially failed at its initial release due to mourning the whole world after Sellers' death (the movie was released less than 3 weeks after) and there is always that sad thought hidden behind your mind when you see it was the last movie vendors. It's far from a great movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous, and sometimes jokes are just not there - but it's nice - if it's just another top performance from Peter Sellers.
