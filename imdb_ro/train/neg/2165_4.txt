This movie was a strange viewing experience. The film is obviously based on a piece. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works very well in one piece, but because it's not interesting in a movie to look. The movie is too "scenic" and did not even bother to change some of the dialogues to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead, what is presented here is an almost literal resumption of a stage play with state-of-the-art characters and dialogue in stages. For this reason, the story does not work and the movie becomes an almost complete and outdated viewing experience. It takes some time before you realize that this is a comedy you're looking for. At first, you think about the drama you are watching, with strange characters in it, but as the film progresses, you notice that the film is more a tragicomedy that relies more on comedy than on drama. br /> <br /> Characters and dialogue are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top movie, which sometimes even becomes undiscovered. Sure, the actors are wonderful; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but do not really raise the film to a "sufficient guard" level. The story feels completely disoriented. In principle, the story has nothing and focuses mainly on brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story? The film feels like a useless and obsolete one, which has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as a movie really is not right and just does not work. Editing is simply terrible and times and becomes even bad luck in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More than expected from director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously made films much better than this projected scenario. it's worth the time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
