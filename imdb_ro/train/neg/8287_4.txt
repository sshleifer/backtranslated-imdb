It's very much a television version of the movie, the movie begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with a dialogue dialog or a description of the characters. It gets a little more substantial after a while, but all the characters are still cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a Frollo hurt and sexually repressed, fighting to make a salad in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> It is also a liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of the Enlightenment ideals, like the abbot in "The Name of the Rose," and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The shadowy part of Quas is ignored, although he pours man-driven liquid. He is indeed just an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than an ordinary person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is for children, but I doubt that, given that Frollo himself is bloody to change his desire to move his monkey. A predisposition that no longer interests and does not forget, but not terrible and sometimes fun, an interpretation of the story.
