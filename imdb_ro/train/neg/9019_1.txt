Why else would that do me for me? Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce successful films. Or even decent films. I've seen Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how "good" Dean Cain is. Obviously, this will be a shot of cheese, and every movie with cheese has its own special way to make your head scratched. I will not name these spoilers as you can not spoil this movie more than it already is. To begin with ... why is a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? Why is a scientist from Chicago and the other scientist is from LA and none could be more East European if they tried? How hard would it be to get either an American actor or just to change that blade state film does the film give us to say that those people are not Americans? Why are there two occasions when the movie gives us a line? We arrive at the helipad-day and then face up a day later. And then that's who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but I think that's out of the way. Does it really have a movie better if you can see it through several separate screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can walk in that room .. over and over ... and over ... and over ... Who on earth was responsible for one of the most serious finals in film history? It was directly from scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... say, do you want to have dinner? Sure, but not in a Chinese place ... with the Dragon in the name! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HAHA HA! I was Superman! AHA HA HA! Ha HA! <br /> <br /> Fade in the black <br /> <br /> My God, made me catch it was so bad. But never fear, even if the whole building exploded ... and no one was alive ... for some reason there is a second unattained and unmanned laboratory that survived well enough to be able to do a sequel. Hate for all of us. <br /> <br />
