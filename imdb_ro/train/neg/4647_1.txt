Half of the reviews were good, so I took a $ 10 chance. Sure, Priscilla Barnes had some sexual talk, but it was not too much. The whole plot later, who might be the other actress mother and the documentary producer who falls for the young man, stretches it. It's not funny, it's not so bad it's nothing but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry, relying on anything that has ever happened in the industry. It could have shocked what is popular today in the adult movies that play the video of today's videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what joke a bigger orgy was made bigger and better decades ago in the early 1970s.
