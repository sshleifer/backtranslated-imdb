I remember the days when Kim Basinger was just a beautiful face that adorned movies with typical characters of blonde, romantic interest or endangered ladies. But it all changed when she won an Oscar Award as Best Supporting Actress for her excellent role in LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance. But after that, her career did not follow the ideal path. Sure, the prestige he earned thanks to that film made him take part in moderately prestigious films (such as People I Know or The Door in Floor), but I have never seen a substantial character. The movie While she was Out does nothing to put her in that situation; and not only that her character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really weird. The script in this movie could not be more empty and basic. However, Basinger brings a certain conviction to her character, and this makes this poor film to earn some points. This film is full of clich√©s and villains generic. Director Susan Montford's work is really disastrous for many reasons, but in because the movie never becomes a good rhythm and tone. Ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.I do not recommend while she was out.This movie commits the sin of capital to be boring.
