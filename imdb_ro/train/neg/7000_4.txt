Hollywood, the house of hype, glamor, and profits, is little dominated by spiritual values, so it is not surprising that its attempts to investigate spiritual life are thin and often stupid (better to go on to movies Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman to study the images of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange adventure film, love story, and religious parable trivialize many ideas that they are trying to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation will work to fit Verne (Clark Gable to the coolest and maneuverable) and Julie (Joan Crawford, who shakes and spits out any other word in an attempt to be Lord Tough Queen) seems ridiculous at best. Is this Holy Patron of the Star System in the workplace, matching the warrior ego before sending them further to the criminal servants on the M-G-M? BUT. . . there are good supporting performances and moments of visual arrest: closed barracks; the boat that escaped the moonlight, or against a landscape of clouds; Julie walks along the seashore as the wind blows; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre), who negotiates Verne's freedom as the storm unfolds; an unusually annoying story of homosexual prison between two convicts. . . Above all, Paul Lukas's worthy and detached interpretation is Hessler, a killer who can appreciate Cambreau's virtues, but he turns his back on him. At the very moment of the movie, Hessler, leaving Cambreau, is outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see the shadows on the face, which transmits a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then it goes out in the night. At this point, Hessler achieves an existential ambiguity, depth, and power that none of the other characters are able to reach. is the secret of the film that his deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler?
