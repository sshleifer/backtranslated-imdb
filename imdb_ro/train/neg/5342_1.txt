Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are on the first place here. They deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm a big fan of the TV show as well. Their music is roasted and they are all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! If you are a fan of the club do not read this !!!!! <br /> Performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not really done correctly (I'm sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 little ones, fond of S Club fans, did not laugh. They thought it could do better. And they did it. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, ugly who started a mosh band" must thank the lucky stars he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. Take care of this movie! Do not go and you do not see it! DO NOT PRAY! PLEASE! 0/10 RJT
