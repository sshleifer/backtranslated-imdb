Presented in 1955, THE COBWEB is an all star cast from the silent veteran screen LILLIAN GISH at Actors Studio descendant SUSAN STRASBERG. Established at an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about the wonder ... ... great drama? Doctor and Patient Relationships? Treatment of shock therapy? No, this prophet is about who will choose the curtains for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm kidding? You will not believe your eyes as you watch this incredible story that has been transformed into a movie! Progressive psychiatric director Dr McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all hospital patients to be involved in the design, selection and execution of new drapes. McIver's married wife GORIA GRAHAM wants to get 2 cents in this monumental task. So did Mr. Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if he really got this too involved in minor details because of his marriage to worry about ward JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hockey story. What did they think?
