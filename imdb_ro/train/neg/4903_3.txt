I am never a great fan of Taiwan film production, unlike Korean, Hongkong or even China. The quality of powerful action is not found in them as clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself an audience like me, in fact, a fan of indie films. However, this film presents a slow plot and slow pace. I woke up lost in the middle of the plot. Action certainly does not make it better. Actress Rainie is under her hair as "over-act," trying to be perry and cute. Although I must admit it's a pleasure to look. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a better role as a confused, sad, regrettable, extremely reserved character. Overall, I find this movie is a disappointment.
