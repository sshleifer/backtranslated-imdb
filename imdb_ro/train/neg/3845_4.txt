Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job like Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I saw. At the end of the movie I was left to feel that there is something missing in it. Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and love her all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as a loving Philip Carey and I got him so much in the movie because I was in love with such a horrible woman. It's so sad when it's in love with a bad seed. And especially if there's someone like Philp Carey, who's a sensitive, though pathetic person. Finally, the act was what came and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but it is not one that would give it away. Although others can find this good movie, we were one who found it that way. I should recommend this film to those who like a bad seed so that they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with that horrible person.
