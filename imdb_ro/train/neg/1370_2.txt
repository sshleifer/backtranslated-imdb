**** ATTENTION: Here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my time running away from waiting for garbage like this? This movie is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, worse director, and we have not yet got to act. And, of course, you can predict the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The hero wizard fights against foolish, corrupt and incompetent listeners. An avalanche is extinguished, burying all the heroes who manage to get out alive, despite the fact that they pass through all sorts of rock dangers. The corrupted partner who caused everything frying together with his payment money. The second heroic avalanche deflected by the adventurous experiment of renegade experts. Wicked masters ultimately prove to have a heart. The troubled teenager crashes into the arms of her stepmother after being rescued by her. Etc, etc, etc, etc., on and on it goes. In fact, there is little reason to warn spoilers. You might be working on the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I was not too wide on the mark for most of the time, anticipating what would happen next. And then we did not discuss the errors actually. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commentator that although there are usually some ransom features even of a bad movie. it would be hard for you to look for something in this. I suppose I gave 2 out of 10 for some nice landscape photos, but that's it. It's been a while since a movie made me stir, but it certainly did.
