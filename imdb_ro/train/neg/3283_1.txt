Okay, we all love Daisy's enemies, but what's going on with this cast. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is no country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I have never noticed that Boss Hog is so tall. This was part of Boss Hog's humor was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now, take Jessica Simpson, throw somebody to forget her husband? He fits Luke Duke to a tee !!!!!! Cleary, these producers have not looked at the appearance of old members. The screen was never present on the duke! This made the movie stop at the beginning. I'm giving this a thick finger.
