Stunning visuals? The safest. I've seen some movies look so good in a fairly short time. Captain Sky and Tomorrow's World are using remarkable cinema, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar, but something fresh. The period seems to be the 1930s or the early 1940s. The film tells of recent attacks on New York by mechanized armies that steal generators and others for unexplained reasons. Also, the mysterious disparities of the relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop and save the world? Okay, there is no need for a leap of faith to know that he is the captain of the sky himself with his girlfriend of malicious reporter, always hot for a lead, and in his wings, his trusty, competent and competent friend. What Captain Sky has in the atmosphere and graphics is missing in stories and characterizations. The film for this movie is ridiculous. That being said, the movie goes for a serious sense of past movie series. They had fairly distant stories and bad action - but none of them, and I do not mean anyone, had the budget and big names that this movie had. Two academy winning performers and Jude Law could keep a movie on the waterline, one can think, but Captain Sky is sinking miserably. Despite the amazing dark look, I woke up wishing the movie would end and I could give my life. I did not really care about a story that generated little interest. I did not care about any of the glib portraits at all. Paltrow was terrible. Jolie was a joke with a role with almost no substance. The law can not carry the tradition with a single line on the limited surface. I mean, let's face it, not Will Smith, Mel Gibson or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it held so much promise, but it was delivered so little. I was bored ten minutes in the film - waiting for something to hide my interest - and never came.
