Just what we need! Another remake of the Hollywood cinema of the epoch, with Eddie Murphy again the second time after The NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This demonstrates why we miss our special ideas in making a quality film, ladies and gentlemen! He has some signs of hope for his pleasant and delightful pictures of animals that can act and talk to people. Things can get worse, unfortunately. Bathing and sexual references instantly kill this "family" piece. Even parents and children saw the trailer announcement in The Channel Family, which was followed by total anxiety and disgust at the cinema. Sad to say that this is the more pro-millennial epoch, but it enjoys it while it lasts because things can only get worse with time. Several went wrong with the new DR. Dolittle. It is absolutely unpaid, the feeling of being too paid. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock! We need more talented voices than a lot of paid celebrities who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I will have to agree with my local newspaper, giving it among the top five top films in 1998. Again, the original version was not good at all. Murphy's next project might be PATTON if he's not careful!
