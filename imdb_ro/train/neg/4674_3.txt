I do not know who it is, Miss Leigh or her director, but her interpretation of Catherine is almost impossible to follow. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, is doing a superior job - against all my chances. His character is entirely too charming and appealing. but he certainly did not look so gluttony to bend with the boldness of Leigh's character. Chaplin seems to be embarrassed by what can not be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather an orthopedic instability. There must be an element of credibility for his interest, but as it is played, it is incomprehensible. Shows do not move. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are, of course, wonderful despite any efforts to derail them. The tower is also a pleasure to look. What a shame, too, leaders do not work together because production is wonderful to look at.
