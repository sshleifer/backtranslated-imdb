We almost never comment on the movies, but I've seen the 5 shining reviews of this "movie" and I've decided I have to weigh on my own review. One of my instructors received this movie by mail, mixed with his Academy's projects (AMPAS, that is, the boys who voted for the Oscars), and was so undercover with how terribly he built this film, in our class demonstrates how we DO NOT make a movie. This movie has no plot, the scenes are horrible, horrifically edited (often using image techniques in the picture), and performances (especially those who really fail to act as a bad actress) are for the most part , unpleasant. Someone has failed to understand the point of introduction, namely plotting. No configuration! Halfway through the film neither me nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was about to happen. The launch of the opening crane, which creates a kind of crime, is never approached, and now, when I think of it, it was possible to be a shot before, with the rest of the film being a retrospective, but it reduces from that scene directly to the next, without any indication as such. Bah, I could go further and further. At least, this film gives me renewed confidence in my ability to create movies.
