When this cartoon was released, I had the impression it would be at least half a descent, boy that I was wrong. I have to admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I've seen a few episodes and two of them had Batman literally throwing his ass left and right by Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the shit out of Batman and watched another episode in which Batman got his ass kicked again by Joker, who, apparently, used Jackie Chan moving as he blows up like a ninja. Since when have Joker or Penguin ever been a match for Batman? and worse still when Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad how Batman's image is portrayed in this show. The animation is awful and the dialogue is terrible. Since being a fan of Batman since childhood, I can advise you sincerely and firmly to stay away and avoid this show at any cost, as it does not promote the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic cartoon Batman I strongly recommend Batman series animated, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Take Batman: Animates Series and do not waste time with this cartoon.
