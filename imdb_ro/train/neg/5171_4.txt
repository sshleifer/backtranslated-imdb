The horror film about a beautiful suburban family dealing with parents' deaths and the underground "stuff" they keep, feeds the people they pick up on the street. Of course, there is more to it, but to say more it would say. For me this has not happened because it tries to have two ways both as a family drama and as a horror movie. the film is trying very hard to go to the cutting edge between the two genres, but it seems to stumble everywhere as it tries to be shocking, which is never really. It does not help that the final revelation is less a scare than a "oh", like "Oh thats it?". Perhaps if I had not watched so many horror films, this could have been better or it would have happened since I would not have compared it so much. pass
