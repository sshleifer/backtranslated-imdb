Three lines of story and did not tie them together enough, "Inside Man" was half and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Although he had moments, the movie began to look like a fast thriller that quickly relied on a slow crawl, jumped quickly between heights and minimums and barely steamed in the last 20 minutes. I'll give credit to Denzel Washington, played a very good role with a full understanding of his human part and not just the typical "super detective," with all the answers. Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality as "evil genius" and "killer brain" (both are not the same in retrospect). However, in general, each person individually created a large sub-section. However, when the pieces finally gathered and everything was calculated, it was never "ah-ha!" or summing up everything. It all ended with a little of the energy with which he started with a lot of plot holes, many questions and, as I said earlier, not close to Spike Lee's normal level. I have to disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the movie they are playing so far.
