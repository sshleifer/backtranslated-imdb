I was in the second grade 12 years ago. I remember clearly. I was learning about space. All little children want to go into space, right? Well, after seeing this, I was so scared to die that I would have "accidentally" given a psychotic robot with a single mind in space. I had no idea it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something like that. I think it was my own version when people were frightened by the radio program "War of the Worlds." So recently, I filmed this movie again, making my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix in it (also known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, laugh at the dramatic parts and laugh even harder on acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, he's moving slowly, have you ever noticed that? I do not think being in space makes you talk so slow or think so slow. The best part is when Andy is unconsciously knocked out of the oxygen tank and begins to float inverted as security doors close. Little Max tries to shoot her. Suddenly, we begin to approach Max's face when he shouts (slow moving) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?" I had no idea.
