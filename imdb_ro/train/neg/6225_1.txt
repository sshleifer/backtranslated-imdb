I doubt this movie will ever be a cult. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much of this movie and even less. What could be smart and moving was the field. It was devoid of the music that made Gram and more stuff than cheap dog food. There was no background about the Gram or the colored people of that era. The characters I have shown have not even been known to me as a fan of Gram and all the versions of his "after-death adventures" that I have heard. Rock-roll is full of stories, also good, but should be taken with a grain of salt. They can be excellent stories even if they are exaggerated. However, this film had a good story and turned into a tribute. The theft of any dead body and its consequences should never be a boring story, but they have done it somewhat horribly. I'm tempted to steal every copy of Parsons of Grand Theft, go to the desert and burn them all.
