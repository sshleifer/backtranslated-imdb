Do not miss 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women". It's an annoying episodic scenario, with three patch story lines together, is laughing about bad because of predictable writing, terrible actors and even bad music. I discovered that the main anorexic character was angry to look every time he was on the screen. SHE needs fast food. Spend the 90 minutes you devote to this turkey making it more exciting ... like cutting your legs. You have more value for entertainment. The only redeeming thing about this movie is Louise Lasser, but it deserves much better than this tired script. He is just as impotent as the biggest guy he judges in the film. <br /> <br /> VISUALIZER!
