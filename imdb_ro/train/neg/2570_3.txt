I read that "It was a girl in my soup" came out during Peter Sellers's low period. Looking at the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Apparently, even the presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help film; not. The whole movie seems to have accidentally shot everything that happened without writing anything. Perhaps I have not seen a middle-aged movie for the elderly who try to be hippies, but it gives a pretty bad name to such films. Overall, both Sellers and Hawn have played in much better movies than this, so do not waste your time on that. Quite devoid of value.
