Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen over the years ... I could not track it all the way ... It's a pure waste of time ... I'm sorry for Snipes that has finished in such a movie. There's not much to say about that. Horror works, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should not be. Just tell you a scene: the police are looking for Snipes and they surround the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot around the building, but still whisper, so Snipes is not guessing anything.
