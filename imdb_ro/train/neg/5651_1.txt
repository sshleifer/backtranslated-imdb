In my life I have seen many great and terrible movies. I'm not an expert in professional reviews, but I certainly have something to say about it. First, these actors are the worst I've ever seen ... Their actor is so unreal that you really want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is related to these dialogues - they are so lame. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. Looks like your 14-year-old son might be better. I think this movie had a budget similar to my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you - save you time and money.
