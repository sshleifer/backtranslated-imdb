Most movies can be easy, even if I do not like the movie. I'm the type of person who recognizes great movies even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not see. Cat in Hat is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. The action is fine (Myers is good as a cat, it's just that it's very unpleasant). The stupid songs of cats were boring and monotonous, even for children in the audience. The story goes further and viewers have to suffer because of poor dialogue. Parental "moody" comments are disgusting, not funny (I remember a horrible commentary about a garden hoe that is compared to, well, a guy who calls her "ho"). Even if the movie is very short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste time. I know little kids who hate this movie. If children can not bear this, I do not know how an adult can. I would like to smoke more about this movie, but I do not even feel more time writing this review about it. I AM URTHT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! Watch a GOOD movie! <br /> <br /> 1/10 Stars - the smallest review I ever made a movie.
