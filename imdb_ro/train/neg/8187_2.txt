I entered this film waiting to be really terrible of God. And it was. I was very sorry for the role star played - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before making this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson failed to put -the one of the fabulous shows I know and love for her. Fred's brother, played by Trevor Peacock (vicar of fable Dibley, among others), had about one line. The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor was ... lacking. (Still, there was a part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classical) You do not see this movie unless your only alternative has a head-on collision with a train (actually - maybe the train would be better ...)
