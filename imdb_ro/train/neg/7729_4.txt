A wonderful mini-TV series completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman who desperately tries to go like a 16-year-old! It's not an exaggeration - that's the current age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the movie opens just before the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. This mini-TV series is indeed the most classic example of the title of this post and one that I refer to when it comes to the subject. <br /> <br /> This is what makes this completely unfinished, despite the fact that it is one of the best filmed in the Second World War, the television shows it has ever produced. If you have a stomach - or a decent restart capacity - you can enjoy Robert Mitchum's delay in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at some of the comments that relate to the love story (intentional game). Have they seen the movie with their eyes closed? Or are aging ages that never ceases to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision." I'm a Boomer, so I do not think for a second I'm a hubristic young punk. 45 You've come to the Biggest 45. Get used. Deal with it. Age of graceful war. The wars of war could have been ... so good. How much do we talk about this mini-series today, about 25 years later, has had an ONLINE influence expressed in such an important and critical role? Right now, with the vehement distraction of old elders, this alone cancels most of the wonderful aspects of the Winds of War.
