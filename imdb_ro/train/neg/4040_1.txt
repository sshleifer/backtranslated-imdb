I think I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although cinematic experience is more suitable for explosions than high dramas, they can be very much locked up on movies. Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I would love to give Kong two stars, doubling this movie. I think people enjoyed this because it was almost identical to the style you see in a play. For the film less discerning, a movie that looks like a piece is a "great art." This movie was useless. There was almost no story so it was based on great drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would escape from the roof or not. So profound and meaningful dialogue? Not. Very true: some of the scenes were interesting, though: the Communist apartments, the city's visions (Petersburg?) And the Soviet trams still in service.
