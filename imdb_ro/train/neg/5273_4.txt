*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** When I saw a preview for this movie, I thought it would be an admirable story. But like most of the original superstation movies, I was disappointed. This gullible family ends up in this "desolate" city to take a brake and find this video camera, showing that these people are doing everything they want and find out that they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious scenes and never do not discover or show the hell he is following them. There are more gaps than I can count on and it does not explain anything that happens how or what. It ends when the family happens in a car crash and it gets seated or brainwashing or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hopes they will somehow find out how it happened, but it ends to leave you completely confused.
