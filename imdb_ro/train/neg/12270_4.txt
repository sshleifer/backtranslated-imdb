This ghost film Kiyoshi Kurosawa is pretty wild, and he had at least one jump hope that caught me on guard. But overall, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to detect a serial killer, only to find out that he has committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a wonderful Asian ghost and has no idea why (nor the spectator). As other crimes are committed, he becomes even more confused, because the killers are easy to find, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the park completely stupid, the lady's ghost is more fun than anything, especially when it's flying in the city like Wonder Woman. And the end does not make sense, in fact, the whole movie does not make sense and I can not recommend it at all. If it had not been so serious, I think it should have been a black comedy. Outside "Bright Future," this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, which I have seen yet.
