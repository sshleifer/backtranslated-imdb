I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so monumental that it was a kind of entertainment. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyper-dramatic mode to which they fall to the firearms, to their incredibly bad action (were the bad guys who just pulled out of the street or were they themselves actors?), In an incredibly bad delivery , to their inexplicable actions (if you try to pull someone through a door as they enter, obviously it is only to pull directly to the door door!). This movie has to break some records for the worst written and delivered lines. Works on the camera were also very bad - you can hardly see what happens in battle scenes by switching camera angles and trembling. /> <br /> I would have voted '1' except I like Chiba and friend Sue Shihomi, and I was amused by a few scenes: 1) Breaking a villain's boot so that the bone comes out of the skin to be hurt) 2) a drug foot that eats a brown-stolen animal (a monkey?) by hacking the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba performs an improvised eye surgery on a guy with his fingers. > <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but that's not really worth it. I saw about 7 or 8 of her films and I came to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching (and they are wonderful!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I also heard that the Executive and Golgo 13 are good. We recommend that you stick to those.
