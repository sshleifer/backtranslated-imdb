When I read MOST from the other comments, I felt I was too shining for this movie. We have found that he has completely lost the spark found in the earlier films Zatoichi and has just shown that after a long absence on the screen, it is often better to let things go. I totally agreed with the Star Trek analogue from another reviewer who compared the first Star Trek movie to the original series - millions of enthusiastic fans were waiting and waiting for the show to come back and were forced to pursue a gentle and sterile harmony with the original. The terrain is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly gorilla (although the recent Zatoichi new by Beat Takeshi is much bloody) and does not have the heart of the originals. I did not seem to have the blood, but some can be disabled by her (especially cut-nose and cut ends). In addition, time was not good for Ichi - he seems a ruined and sad man in this movie (much, much more than usual) - and that's something the show fans might not really want to see . <br /> <br /> This was a very bad turn for Zatoichi. If you are not like me and want to see ALL the movie Zatoichi, it is very easy to read. See one of the previous versions or the ALL-NEW 2003 version.
