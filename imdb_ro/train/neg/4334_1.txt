This movie had potential and I was willing to try, but there are so many time issues that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow that you treated like an idiot. Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's path is in the mid-seventies. For this film to be realistic, it should have been set in the 1950s, if not in the late 1940s. Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando about which Carlito is supposed to have fled to hei-day. None of the original characters in the original movie was in this movie. We have to believe that Carlito met these people in a few years. Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking on the beach talking about paragliding, what he wanted to do in the original movie. Pre-quelles also create the characters Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them because they are not clear in Carlito's Way? It's also hard to understand how Carlito might have the relationship with the Italians he has in his original film watching the events in Rise to Power. Where are Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two movies and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. It is obvious that nobody was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some money by making a medium gangster film and casting a character called Carlito Brigante. The movie had some good moments, but I think it would have been better to let this film stand alone instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. If you feel determined to watch this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think that the movie is a linear pre-quel. Think of this as Western spaghetti with Clint Eastwood's man, no name, that is, two films that have the same character but are not necessarily linked.
