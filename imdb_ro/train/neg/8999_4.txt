Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and SCTV graduate are together in a funny movie sometimes. However, it is very interesting to watch now at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this film is supposed to look how many of their bands have become absolutely true: There is a remarkable movie that probably was not even smart at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man," which happened to Arnold Schwarzenegger's stupidity "Junior" There is a commercial spoof, which probably was not smart at the time because Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling," which has now been celebrated with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing." There is a remarkable film that probably was not smart at the time, presenting John Candy in a movie about a cut head. Watch this trailer and show how similar are the pictures and the plot to Frank Hellenlotter's Basket! And finally there is a late night documentary about "a dead dream, the only two remaining ..." The documentary name is ... NEXT NEXT! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
