I can not believe I actually saw this, but I just wanted to know if this movie would become funnier and more fun to the end. and he did it. the culmination was the worst performance ever made by the defense attorney - both in real life that even for a fictitious story it was too strange. no one on this planet can behave in the face of a court like her. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. a simple search for her house would have led to finding the rings. But it is not working. he preferred to say "objections" 2 or 3 times during the whole process - so it was. the blonde blonde was given a drug truth to prove him innocent, but not Brett. the madman had almost Brett's altar in her house, which could have proved her sick obsession. but again it does not work. During the scene, I felt the silent need to pull the needle out of my hand and to beat it several times over my head. even the real strangers do not show that the stupid stupid "I am innocent," as he did. and what does this movie tell us? she never marries a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls on the stairs, her husband will be thrown into prison, guilty or not. evil, bad people.
