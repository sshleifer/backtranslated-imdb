it's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. it is so bad that I realized it was quite pleasant. act, God, the script, you have to be a child. as you can imagine the writer who comes up with things like: - a fireworker in school, powerful SO fireworks, that when someone is hit by it, they fly a hundred yards back and explode. - a girl is trapped in the cell, the killer tries to open the door. she does an exercise, but the thread is not long enough. she first makes an extension cord, oh the horror, and then, after finishing, she pulls through the door and trains through the killer's head. WOW - and there are several examples of it. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool Luke hand)
