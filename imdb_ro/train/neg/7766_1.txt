<br /> <br /> As in the other episodes of the television series made for the many adventures of the maritime legend, Horatio Hornblower's superhuman infallibility ruins all the chances of suspense. <br /> <br /> As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation, Horatio Hornblower rescues invinciblely from any situation. Every intelligent solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower. Unmistakably superior, Hornblower's main issues in the film series seem to tolerate the many error characters above and below it in the chain of command. A perfect being creates the boring story. So the superior is our hero, even those who try to help him are not able to do anything right unless Hornblower is there to guide and control each movement. What makes sense to tell a story about any person who can not do wrong and will win repeatedly at all in every moment? What is the purpose of watching such a story?
