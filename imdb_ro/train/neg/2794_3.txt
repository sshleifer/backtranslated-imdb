Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll check the movie on TMC, nothing better. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far and it's only half done. I seriously believed that it was one of those soft-core movies with a heavy plot and rough action, crappy filming and crappy effects. But no, I do not even have that pleasure. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping to laugh, but I was not sure if they were trying to throw in gaskets or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest just before Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe better. And now I'm going to sit here typing until I have 10 lines
