the guy who wrote, directed and looked at this shocking piece of garbage should really consider a change of caregiver. Yes Rob Stefaniuk, I mean! Seriously, who financed this stupidity? there are so many talented writers to whom they could spend better. I think the idea is great, but action, script and direction are just terrible! The banks are not that funny, I understand they should take Mickey. But do it with style, this movie is screaming 1995 on Saturday night live. Why, I say again why studios give money to hackers such as Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER EVER HAVE NEVER A COMMANDER The opportunity to write directly and to be in your own movie. SPIRIT!
