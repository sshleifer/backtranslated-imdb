Nothing can prepare you for another bimbo trip! This time, it's brought to you by Ray Fred Olen, which is never inevitable! As for exploitative movies, it does not click! Like science fiction, it's definitely uniginal! All we see is an ugly female android who wears a bikini besides destroying the Earth and revealing everything that's almost empty to resist! Give me a break! If this type of entertainment is your thing then why not dust those old swimsuit magic from the attic for a change?! This would have been much better if it had not set a very high pay factor, but that would not do that much. I would like to highlight another film titled ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why the first-time action films "fatal females" do not translate well into America. Sorry, boys!
