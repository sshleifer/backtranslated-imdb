the end of the world looks like a good film on the cover but be warned bad.being a big fan of star mega star Christopher Lee I was tricked. as the tentacles (77) a good distribution does not mean it will be a good movie. the beginning seems promising then it turns into tune, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. briefly Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I was expecting better at the band Charles, who made fun movies such as the re-animator and the dolls. heard that Christopher Lee was mistaken to make this film. said his stars will be Jose Ferrer, john carridine and Dean Jagger.well Dean Jagger is there but the other two have never succeeded (lucky) if you make a movie about the end of the world use a larger and better budget storyline.dean Jagger continued to make two good movies afterwards, alligator (80) and game of death (79) sued Lyon (Lolita) is also in the minus movie lollipop.if you are a greedy for the punishment, then watch the end the world dares to say you awake during the entire movie. 1 out of 10.
