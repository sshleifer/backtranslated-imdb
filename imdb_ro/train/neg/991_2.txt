If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight against sex attacks, then this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who was a victim and struggles back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her aggressor. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to the use of vigilance. In essence, it cancels the judiciary. "The accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judiciary and wins. What does "Downfall" mean to tell the victims of the attack that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the accuser? Not!!!
