I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say this in front! He is an enormous talent and the best of what he does, who is a nervous, scary loser, cast into a position of authority. He is fabulous in the role of Roy Fleming, the Reluctant astronaut, but the film is quite dull indeed, even though as a child, my brother and I enjoyed watching this film and the others. Still worth watching, but it really is a movie that kids enjoy best. I would categorize myself as being 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your children on a family night. As with all Knotts movies, there is an extraordinary cast of character loved actors and you can not help smiling when Knotts gives one of his strange eyes with his eyes open, no matter how old and crazy you are. From the perspective of adults, one thing I think is great about this movie is how it captures NASA in the 1960s - all the new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how much suave and studio Leslie Neilsen was then. Just a complaint about the story is the interest of Roy's love, a pretty undressing, untouchable woman who can not give her time to become a big blow - if you're like me, you'll hope she'll push her to the end. Beware - you'll be whistling the theme song for a few days after watching, it's so appealing.
