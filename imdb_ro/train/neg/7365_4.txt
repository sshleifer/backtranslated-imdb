A bad movie, but not that big. Kirk Douglas is a recently released prisoner who, after making an offer from Mob, decides to shoot his own business. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Maybe a shirt. Douglas and Gemma are soon watched by the goof mafia Romano Puppo, as well as clung to a loving triangle with Douglas's infinite girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Michele Lupo's Director keeps pace in rapid motion and there is at least one excellent and creative tracking sequence for the Puppo & Gemma car. Although an Italian production, most of the filming seems to have been made in Germany. Douglas is all right, not just jumping into a Giallo quickie. Bogdan Bolkan offers tremendous performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone, and the cinema is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
