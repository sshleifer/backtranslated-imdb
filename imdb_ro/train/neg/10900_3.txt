You can not take too much against this, knowing it was done in four days and I expected to be campy anyway. (With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take seriously, the rest of the cast plays halfway, Riley Smith is very bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paying attention to which I was shocked; I've assumed the whole goal with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to meet the most bizarre sexual fantasies and not to damn about the story, but I use a lot of words like "technology" and "physicality" in scenario to get their point of view. (Although the story may be important only to explain why there are so few casting members.) Nobody cares about this stupid story, and the only interesting things in the movie are the mockery of cults and the soft core homoerotics so enthusiastic). I would have liked it more if it were just random killings for no reason. The film is granular, with a TV-quality look and a level of action. There are some "sexy" scenes that are okay - the boys are spinning in bed in their boxers, they feel up; or being tied up and making orgasmic faces while the wine is poured on them - and some of them are kind of funny. And I liked L. Ron Hubbard's digging, and the intentional irony of a religious cult story said with intense gossip of homosexuality, but it's still not good. 3/10
