I realized that the whole joke of the movie would be to see a rich white man behave like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock react to people's reactions. Instead, you see Chris Rock being himself and people who do not understand him. There are perhaps 2 scenes in the whole movie in which they use their gimmick. It should have been a lot better.
