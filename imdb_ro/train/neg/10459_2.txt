Discussed, unclear, bad scenario, poor photography and direction ... all in all obvious, a first mistaken effort to commercial filming by good people at TBN. TBN images have been a great success in the past, helping to bring "Big Cry," Nora Lam's story, to the big screen. But "Omega Code" is a disaster. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs and who loved "China Cry," it still seems impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do much better with their ministry, but this is not an example. Do not waste your money ... instead go rent China Cry.
