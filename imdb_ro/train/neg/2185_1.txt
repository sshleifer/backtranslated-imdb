... or an audience. A quick review ... So you have this doctor who has experienced body parts for a vague reason. He wants to perfect transplants, but he feels he has to do that in his basement. WTF ??? Then, suddenly, unfortunately and conveniently, his fiancé removes his head in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonized by pain, he keeps his head in a lasagna pan (or is a strudel?) And pumps it full of "adreno-ser" (sic) to keep him alive. Then she wakes up, talking to her head (so to speak), even if her neck was obviously cut to the vocal cords and has no lungs, so she could not speak, even if she had. It seems that ungrateful boredom does not appreciate everything her fiancé did for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his pain turns into a hacking, seeing the possibility of slinging his lover's head on the body of the first bizarre bimbo he can pick up on the street. Meanwhile, the physician's assistant, a sort of Igor shop, comes up with philosophical arguments with his head, which has hit a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every crazy scientist has one). Finally, the screenwriter realizes he can not continue to engage his misogynism and fear of intimacy issues on an ad infinitum audience, so he kills everyone, then probably goes to the bank to win the check before the financial supporters of the movie has the chance to stop paying on it. <br /> <br /> I mentioned that I think this is a bad movie? Someone should tell Turner Classic to stop showing the edited version without empty stuff. The assistant's gaze, with his arm torn, circling around the house without leaving much blood wherever it is too precious.
