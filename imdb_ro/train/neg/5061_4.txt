Anurag Basu, who collaborates with the KUCCH TO HAI flop, made his debut in this film. The film was ahead of its time in a way, although it has a different story and it has come closest to HAWAS which it launched a week before and fortunately this was better and made a better deal The film starts well, Malika's guilt is well shown at first though the scene with Emraan - Malika is too brutal / vulgar The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well handled and the twist in the story Ashmith faces Emraan is brilliant The rhythm it moves quickly and the viewer is held at the edge, but Emraan's second friend is not entirely convincing. Also, the policeman's piece seems to be half ripe The end is too filmed too Direction of Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all the songs were fab The work room was amazing Emraan played very well in his naughty series, he was the role that gave him a secondary role and although he continued to play such roles and was annoying in this film he was superb Ashmith too was good in his role for once He did a good job and one his only good performance and she showed good Malika was brilliant in her esp role in the second half but she was not upmarket delivery was sometimes rare, she showed such a potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is OK
