I went to this film waiting for a concise film about the effect that Sam's son had on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me to feed more rubbish on racial tensions, mob-justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure from colleagues. Lee presented an extreme opinion. The whole movie could have been more effective if in a 90-minute format with more attention, the less tangential sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Do not even take care of renting the video if you do not enjoy the passion of Spike Lee; In such a case, the theater deserves. This is not an escapist movie.
