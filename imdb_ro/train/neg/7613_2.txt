The little city of Californian Diablo is affected by mysterious deaths after shepherd Robert Lopez discovers an old box. Legend has it that boxing has the sixteenth-century Mexican demon named Azar. The FBI agent, Gil Vega, is sent to investigate the murders and join the forces with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, to fight the evil demon and the blood. "Diablo's Legend" is an absolute garbage. The film has no scarecrows and gore, the act is amateur and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect of the movie I liked. I'm a great fan of horror indie, for example, I liked "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Bickness" or "Watch Neighborhood", unfortunately "Legend of Diablo" misfire. Definitive one to avoid.
