This movie is not a movie for kids! This film is like a "bad acid" trip for children under the age of 5. For a month, my 4-year old in time would ask, "Why was the rabbit bleeding in the mouth?" Or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" (And that was not the worst of them). We stopped for about half an hour, but the damage was done. Very morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he looked finally everything was miserable. Anyone who has decided that the film should be sold to children should be prosecuted. ... (Continue to censure me, my consciousness is clear).
