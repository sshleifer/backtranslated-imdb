Oh God. It was terrible. It's bad, then that was it. This movie makes no sense. It runs across the map and it is not clear what it says at all. Music seemed to try to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, takes it back. Since I've been living in Vancouver, watching this film and recognizing all of these places made it unbearable. Why did not they make a real city? The only writing that was decent was "Tilman" in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor to play realistically and not on top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a bad man with a lot of screen time, and the movie was a wash. Sin. We hope an important person will see him and, at least, give credit to John Heard if he is given credit and will hire him again as a lead villain again where he should be. on list A.
