I was very dissatisfied with this move. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was dissatisfied, the action was overcome, the unpleasant songs. Even the story was effortless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts such as Guru and Dhoom, we had great expectations. The actors have worked too hard and have not helped the movie at all. Of course, Kareena shook the screen in a bikini, but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should look for the way action movies are made. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because it's their signature song. But the signature of the Hindi cinema is the songs. A good action movie should not take more than two hours and it may not seem unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these action movies will become much clearer. Noteworthy: Action and comedy movies do not mix unless they do the right thing. Good luck next time.
