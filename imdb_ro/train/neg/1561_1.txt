Anyone who gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies. A loser takes his camera and takes a picture of his mental family. The movie is full of idiots and includes live "teabagging". This should sum up everything for you. Do not waste time. You may want to watch the whole movie in the hope that it will get better as it happens - no!
