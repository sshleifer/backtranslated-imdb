But this movie was boring. History was good, but the music was not. No song caressed me and no soundtrack to be heard. If sweet Jesus "should have been a comic amusement, it never works, if John Adams was supposed to be annoying, the rest tried to overthrow him in every scene." Hancock and Jefferson were the only characters that were supportive throughout the movie. The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their history was quite interesting, but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical. You should not crawl the music after a musical, except for a few noises, nothing else deserves breathing .
