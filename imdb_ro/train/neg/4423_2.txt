Another film that has been forgotten close to the 1930s Poverty Row, resurrected by the magic of the DVD. In the lead role, Lionel Atwill, the universal player (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein films) twins involved in a rocket crime. One kills the victims (brokers involved in a scam) and calls witnesses for the exact time, while the other is deaf and turns out to be "innocent" because he could not speak with the witnesses. Of course, where does it break out if it was a congenital deafness, would not they both be deaf? Well, Atwill does a pretty good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else can really act as a darn.
