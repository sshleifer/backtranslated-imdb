If you want to see a mystery, do not look at it. Although there are elements directly on Elmore Leonard's territory, this is approaching an episode of the "Dynasty," as the director focuses on "character development" - long and boring talks between stupid and uninterested characters. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not on this one. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
