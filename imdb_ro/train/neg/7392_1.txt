I'm looking around in the video store still shocked that Steven Seagal with his Bad Action movie history may have another 3 movies hit on the shelves in less than a year. The attack force is the third, no less promised entry for the first time in Sci Fi Genre for our growing seagal seagal.Visions of bad movie entertainment flashing before my eyes gullible.Dad much this is not the case a little, without entertainment and an as bad movie as they come. Seagal came back a little with Shadow Man at Trashy - but it was the last time I saw him. However, the force of the attack must be the worst absolutely absolute movie! the bottom of the septic tank here. Anyone who says it's about Steven Seagal's return to the form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is still an agent / I am a bad asshole, once again called Lawson wants revenge for killing his team, leading him to an angry plot to distribute a really bad medicine for has unsuspecting publicly. I can not mention the dealers are not around here. All production from Directing to acting is poor. Was this movie shot in the dark? It has to be the worst illuminated movie from Howling 2. This action is terrible and very wrong. The producers have also decided to do what the fans hate the most: throw in the double stunt after the double and double-dubbed terrible Steven Seagal. show him a little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? While it was said that Attack Force was not the movie that Stevie signed for (originally Harvester) and definitely has to be better than the Force Attack. - manipulation of production did not make it more coherent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad about Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Hal Pin because they will be forever judged for bad-reclaimed re-shoot production. So now, this leaves Seagal unable to come up with something to indulge in this mess. But after seeing how bad the Force Attack proved to be really wanting to make another movie?
