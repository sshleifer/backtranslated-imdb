Oh, dear sir ... They turned what was a pretty provocative film believed in a swaggering testosteron fest. The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our Kowalski hero. He was a man trying to go from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why did he want to risk his life for the price of a hand of faces? We are not very sure. We had some flashbacks that gave us the image that it was an adrenaline, and he probably drove all his life trying to get to the point of extinction. The point you see at the distance between your left and right shoulders is approaching, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free and means that he is not sick on anyone. I have seen many times when there were accidents that he stopped to make sure the other driver was fine before moving on, even the cops who were following him. When he saw the futility of his search, he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity. He died as if he lived, running wide. In remake Kowalski has a whole history (including a name, even.) Trying to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications her pregnancy. She is a devoted and excited young man. He arrives at the decision to take his life after hearing that his wife died while delivering, but even left HERE in question when he suggested he could have jumped off the car before running in bulldozers. They even played the role of "super soul," the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?! ?? Save me.
