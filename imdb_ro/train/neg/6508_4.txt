This is a confusion of Frankenstein's old premise. A valued scientist is killed in a strange accident, and his father, a known brain surgeon, saves the brain. It is then put into a robotic body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the impulse of the "colossus" to transfer thoughts to movement. The whole project is going bad when the creation goes berserk. <br /> <br /> Special effects are underdeveloped. The script is missing. And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. Very young children will think it is good. If you're awake at three in the morning and this happens ... night, night. The leading characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the Colossus.
