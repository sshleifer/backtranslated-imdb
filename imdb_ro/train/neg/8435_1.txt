Very disappointing film. Until the end, I did not care for any of the characters. I loved seeing Ving Rhames in a small part, and William Macy was good as always, but I do not deserve to look. It starts strong and just gets weaker and weaker. I'm going to like insomnia, because I'm sure it'll make them sleep.
