This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled materials. People who hit the head are not funny. People who hit are not funny. The third time a guy was hit by balls, not even the youngest member of the audience laughed. She was just tired quickly. I went with my little sister. In fact, she laughs loudly at the King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece has bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty tense. A mind thief steals a big diamond in what was certainly the lightest heist in Hollywood history. Then he hides himself with a family claiming to be a child. I know it sounds interesting, but that's the whole story. Say these two lines over an hour for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture. There are predictable jokes. I felt abducted after seeing this. I did not expect too much and I was still disappointed. I want Keenan to hire only decent writers to write jokes and / or the next scenario. This was even worse than White Chicks, if that is possible. I've seen high-school and cheaper high school play. There was something positive about this movie. I do not like my fun to be crushed.
