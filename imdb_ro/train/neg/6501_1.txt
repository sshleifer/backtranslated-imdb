This movie is again one of the movies someone thinks or tries to make others think they understood it. Anyone who tries to understand this is a MORON! My advice would be to take two, not two, but two very strong acid strokes and at least you will get a visual feel of it! Although at the end you might be killing yourself because you waste your acid! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who will try to defend the movie. Unintelligble. Trash. Schitzoid. Talent waste. The film is ice, with paper on destination, with clouds of noise, on a sunny dip in the pudding ... It sounds like a lion in red light with the hair seen. Now explain this to me !!!!
