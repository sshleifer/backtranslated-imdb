That could be a bit tough for me saying this, but unfortunately so far in his directing career is true. Just take a look at what he has done so far. They just pass the 3-star mark. Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was remarkable in this film, her performance carries the whole movie. I hope she has a "blockbuster" and falls into the bigger league of actors, she has clear skills. Greg was not that impressive, the typical television style. The movie is described as a strange horror. The only "horror" is short flashbacks, and lasts for 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. I personally would call it a "drama / thriller" more. But no matter how interesting the story, targeting, editing and bad action (from Lucy) destroy it. You have no real connection with the actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit there watching you feel nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... in fact, I think TV soap would be more exciting. My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better still stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved in.
