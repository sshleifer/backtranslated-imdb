I wanted to vote zero or less. I liked the comment. It's the worst movie ever made, and "insipid" is the perfect word for it if it's not something worse that Roget never believed. I'm also at a loss thinking of something negative enough to describe Bo Derek exactly. What is best to say about it is that it is consistent.
