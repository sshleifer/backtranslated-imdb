Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst TV show ever made. There is no plot but just a bunch of stupid children who use martial arts while dressed in second class spandex. The special effects show that since the 70s, the costumes look like something of a bad comedy, and the show is simply terrible. The only thing worse than the television show is the toys, the second-half plastic garbage fed to our children. <br /> <br /> There are far better performances for your kids to watch! Try to give your children something like Nickelodean, those shows actually have some information behind them, unlike those who have power.
