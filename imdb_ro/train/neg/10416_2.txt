Before watching this movie, I'd say I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all - minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his action. Someone should have told him that the "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, neither ignorant nor clich√©. That's for the stereotypes of Randy Quaid. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not an actor strong enough to carry this saturated mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best thing I can give him. I'm a serious fan of some strange and strange movies, but that's just terrible.
