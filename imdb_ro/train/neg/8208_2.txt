"Hey everyone, I have an idea, we found this from eggs in outer space, why not defrost it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the worst thing a scientist could do and it could be filled with contaminants or contaminants unknown to the earth and that could destroy the human race, but hey, I want to I know what's in it. " "And nobody is telling them NASA, they could take us from us." "Wow this thing gives vibrations!" "Yes, really strong in contact, so do not touch it, but it's good to do it." "Hi there, check my nips." (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN" !!!!! We have to run to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have phones or radios or intercoms, even if we have another equipment here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, let's take this stick and stab it." "I'm leaving here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on earth, no one cries me!" "Look, they are the friendly aliens in" The Abyss! "They want to come with them." THE END
