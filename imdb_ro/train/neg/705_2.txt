There's so little here in the fantastic book Anne Rice that what's here does not make sense. Some characters - intense and surprising characters - do not do it on the screen at all, and those who do are dipped to the point where there is no reason to have them. the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the business between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose come from when her story never explained? Where is the rape and redemption of Marie, whose biggest attribute (and fall) is that she can go for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why is the film ending with the beating of Marcel in his father's hands? We find nothing in Aglae beyond the fact that she is a bitch who hates her husband; why any backstory does not explain this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for performance, there is not one that is better than mediocre, although this is probably due to the poor scenario. The best of the batch is that of the actor who plays Richard - but Richard is not on the screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though, again, refers to the actress who has nothing to do with what she offered to work. Everything is just terrible. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice movie to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes misery a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a slut that she will allow the best works to become so foolish on the screen?
