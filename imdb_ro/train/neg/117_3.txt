It was great to see some of my favorite stars thirty years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked great. But that was it. No good characters or lines were given to them. I did not understand or care what the characters are doing. Some of the smaller roles of the women were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small parts. They showed a talent and it is sad that they did not participate in more good movies. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the chance to act in this important film role. The film seems to have some fans, and I was very open when I started to see it. I'm a great fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I liked his latest movie "Cat's Meow" and all the oldest of "Targets" at Nickleodeon. So I was really surprised that I could barely fear that. It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency where detectives and clients engage romantically with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's former boyfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a series of television called "Moonlighting," which stole the idea of ​​Bogdanovich's story. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series were based on tons of spiritual dialogue, while this is trying to be done with paper and a few screw lines. Bottom line: It's not "Paper Moon" and just a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
