This mini-series, also based on Alex Haley's book "Queen," attempted to use similar formulas, meaning to build a long history of family life over many years. While in Queen the result was master, here in Mama Flora inspiration was lacking. First, probably in the book itself, and certainly in this television production. Too much is being put on too much rush over the years, so the saga that is unfolding is shallow, shallow, not as authentic as in the "Queen". The full size of the script from the earlier parts of the film, which was carefully prepared, but as the film progresses, it seems to degenerate into a kind of unpalatable Dulceian-forsythian blend in the last third of the three hours or so long . Hopefully more; but obviously, Haley was less inspired by this story than the nearest queen, and Peter Werner III does not match John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long stories of growing generations.
