The turgid rhythm of this film fills us with any shocks that it could offer. There was no real suspense. Most characters were insipid. The Irish priest, who was inflamed, was as lame and loving. Interest is misleading. The girl they chose to offer the sensuality of the film could be better. The central conflict of the main character was inappropriate. This film is entirely positive. It's like a boring exercise by someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but he did it anyway.
