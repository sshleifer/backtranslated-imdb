Absolute garbage. The reason why this is so terrible is not because it deviates from the formula, but because the plot was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did not do anything to solve the case - and no one else did - it was just a routine police job. Shadowy shadow. You have come to the end, hoping to change your mind - and you only had a terrible feeling of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There is so much potential to have a relative in the raptures. It could be the personal involvement of the Lt. <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were to make a stranger. But certainly a genius like Lieutenant C, through constant conversation with the unjust husband, would gradually discover a diabolical plot involving a tape recorder that plays in the shower room, while a masked bride captures the bride, hides the body and then schedules the clues subtle. It could have been good. It was a waste of time.
