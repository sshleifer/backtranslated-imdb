We have discovered that the Curve of Eden is very poorly built, which made it difficult to supervise. However, there is something I have to say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere in the early 1970s in choosing settings and clothing. The "back to earth" philosophy and interest in sexual exploration and drugs that have not been decadent dramatically, as they were presented in many later versions of the 1970s, were just like "do not ask not to say" pseudo - the liberalism of fraternity made up of East Coast intellectuals, except that I thought it was more likely a school in New England than one in Virginia, where I imagine that the "good boy" mentality still dominates even the elite one schools . Another thing I have appreciated and can talk about is that it was a time when homosexuality was not related to queens of both skin and love and I appreciated certain homosexual roles that were not related to these terrible images to overlap. I felt very regrettable that "gay culture" took some standard forms in the 1980s in the Castro and Christopher streets, and they defined the movement and left a large number of gay men who were more submissive in their lives. I appreciated the movie mainly as a way to remind us of a more natural way we had about our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene".
