The movie starts with 3 people meeting in the bar. O.K. I'm talking about their imaginary lives, stretching all the time, for no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they really make you laugh. Interesting. The first 30 minutes you enjoy it! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing is happening ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see is old naked "ladies" touching each other! It's not good. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but it's all except that! The movie is pointless, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) at FEST (film festival), this movie was the most popular, according to research, of course, before people look at it! I really thought (before watching): "Hay, this could be interesting, though it's a Russian movie!" But, Lord, no!
