This film is one of the worst of the year. The main characters do not have chemistry, and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has any talent and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is at that show, but it was horrible in this movie. It's like he does not know anything about acting. All that has her character is to drink throughout the movie, and she can not get away from being a b **** and still fun. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows a little excitement and it's like watching the books with a knife while reading them. As for the story, it's a cutter. It goes from point A to B with a little surprise. So much could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have rotated more around it and the things it makes as a spirit. VERDICT FINAL: It's not worth watching.
