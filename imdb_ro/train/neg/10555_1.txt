First of all: I like Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget movie is nothing like that! Image quality is so low, the most annoying soundtrack I've ever had (!!!!) I've heard, and in terms of the FX ... and the super-low quality makes some of them they look not as bad as they are in a real movie (which is not here). No concept, a thin story, a primitive action, and a rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each repeating about 20 times ... the same for many movie sequences (it can be an indication of what The story seems to be that a boy had to look at his father's rape and kill his mother, was psychologically destroyed, and when an adult went to tournaments, making a show of self-mutilation. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-art-idiot directors, this plot is just a line to put the cheap shock scenes produced in a row that have no message or make no sense (freshly removed from the intestines are thrown on an empty woman bound in a hole in the ground ... why and why is this the only time you see the woman and the thrower in the whole "bloody" movie) ??? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? Not! Artistic? NOT!!!!! Everyone who confuses this inexpensive gore-art show should visit his psychiatrist as soon as possible or should look at Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar subject can be drawn in an artistic way. I hope this was the first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you have to do with your head there, you remember: Not everything that looks cheap and obviously no sense is automatically "Art" ...
