For those of us who lived in those weeks of filming in the city and around the Valley - not to forget the tiresome days of road closures and "filming". As a reminder for those who live here - local include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. and so on The bank was BC fire; The chase scenes included Luna Drive off Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd, and Hwy 1. Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most approachable, Matt Broderick was above all - even then. As for the movie - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh about acting and plot - but who cares about this level. A pleasant time capsule for those who enjoy the landscape and the landscape of the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the Movie), the original name of the movie was Welcome to Buzzsaw - The Old Erba's parking lot was the city square, photos from the backyard behind Grove Street in Boulder Creek; stop thinking and see some actors in their early days.
