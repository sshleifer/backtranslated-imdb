This movie is considered by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible to be ridiculous. The only way to save this film is to deliver cheesy lines that are so embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. There are some good songs and good choreography in this movie, but WHAT WHAT! There is no plot, it is put into a theater without any change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie, because he said I can not believe how bad a movie can be! Was right. Normally, with such a terrible movie, I would recommend people not to look at it, but in this case I think people should, because it will put any other bad movie that you have seen in perspective.
