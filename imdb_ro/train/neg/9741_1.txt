(spoilers) A truly memorable part of this strange and cold British kitchen is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst things ever to paint. That, and the magnificent eyebrows of man on the old kind of evil trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a funny and boring movie boring. He likes it especially when Crow kills Mike with the "touch of death," and when he revives him in the theater, Mike shouts, "Guys, I've died, I've seen the truth and eternal beauty, it's this movie ..." That would be overturning, having to return from life after death to look at the rest of the Designed Man. The film could make a fortune sold as a sleeping aid. Some of the bullets in the movie were bad: the police inspector - "electrocution!" Crow- "Shocking, is not it?" police inspector - "That's LOwe, okay" Tom Servo- "Very low, right next to the floor!" police inspector - "Can I go?" Tom Servo - "He's Dead, But Beat It Out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
