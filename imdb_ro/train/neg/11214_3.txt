I also saw this movie on a local visit about a year ago. First of all, I'll say it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinema. I just want the movie to be as good as it looks. I would not call a horror movie. Getting into a few shots of a fallen ghost does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what happens to both sides of the whole movie. The action was fine, I think, but nothing special. And the slogan, "Revenge can be deadly" ... really ... ... should you check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have exactly the same taglin? <br /> <br /> It's my pain to say a few of this, but I know a lot of people who worked on this movie, and I know they do not want people to smoke their ass, so I give my sincere opinion .
