I watched this movie. To the end. And that was not easy. It's so boring, badly played and in almost every detail stolen by "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe that the producers take this seriously. Even harder to believe, is how this "product" did it on VHS and DVD. So if you want to see a horror movie, just watch "Scream," but if you want to laugh aloud and have a good time, watching some kids crossing the wood screaming at each other and showing their inability , watching the dark area.
