Because of budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (even if he killed six people) and was taken halfway home to Hope Bartholomew. Once there, she immediately relapses into her crazy criminal paths and kills any of her and her food. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks! You know that you have problems when open credits start and are just the credits of the first movie, apparently filmed on the TV screen. Nick Millard (nicknamed Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later, and with a budget that probably covers the cost of a blank tape and rental of video cameras for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into the video. Seriously, I've made home movies with higher production value than that. And Millard is trying to shoot a quiet night, NIGHT NIGHT 2, filling half of the running time with images from the first movie (which seems to have been taken from a worn VHS copy). Alden is again good as Ethel, but the movie is so frightening that you start to feel sorry for her playing in this trash. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if possible), unclear room work, horrible audio and editing, which seems to have been made with two connected VCRs. Avoid this at any price!
