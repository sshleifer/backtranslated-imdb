I have to admit that, in fact, her dead body was not as bad as I expected, Mom wanted to see her, so I hired her. I just thought to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes, but actually it was not too bad. I was expecting this terrible movie, but it seems the writers do not mean any harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, I'm sorry) seems to be a bit off for the movie. I think maybe I found her a little better without her, just annoy me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat pleasant. But we have to admit, it was useless for this movie, it was one of the quick pay for the actor type. The movie could have been funny if someone really paid attention and had a better caste. Henry just lost her bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister leads him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls for her, but Kate haunts her beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to go so fast as to make sure Ashley does not receive it by torturing her day and night with her storms, believe me, in Kate's voice, which is scary. <br /> <br /> Over her dead body is a good movie, I'm not sure if it's worth the money, but I'd give you a rent if you want to see it or you're curious. Eva Longoria does not have enough power to make the movie work, no offense to those who love her, she just belongs on the small screen above the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, she does not seem to be too pleased with everything she's pulling, or her gay friend, Dan, again not very fond of it. Only with a re-writing and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but we will get a medium predictable average comedy that will leave with an empty feeling.
