Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films since 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and bring it and fails. When I saw last January, I was so disgusted with the movie I went to and talked to my girlfriend's cell phone for the last half hour of the movie. I heard that the DVD has a director cut, maybe I will check it, but this PG-13 trash is s *** and the worst kind of s ***. Perhaps if the movie had something T & A, that would have done it well. But the bands are blades and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
