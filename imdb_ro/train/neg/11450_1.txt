I've come to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what way they can ever improve it before leaving August 3rd. She plays Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as "Hot" Rod Kimble. Playing a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we meet, he kisses a truck on the mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped and almost succeeds. He would be worthy of a "Jackass" film if he did not really try to do that. Isla Fisher interprets the little girl slightly older and more mature, Denise. Looks like he likes Rod to join his team. Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents waterfall cascades. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. He remarried with Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a tough guy who likes to beat Rod in a real beating. It is clear that Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat him. We find that Frank needs $ 50,000. Heart transplantation and Rod is determined to raise the money just to be able to beat his butt after being healed and to prove himself a man. A long fall on one side of the mountain convinces Rod to "go" in a cascade. Rod is preparing to get money for sowing, letting him do stunts that would make you knock on if you had seen them in real life. Like the human torch - at a birthday party. There were those at the show who managed to laugh at most cascades. Only when all hopes and money are lost is a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. He receives exclusive broadcasting rights and sets up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new suit and a real motorcycle. The whole city is coming back and the world is coming in. Does he have the jump? Does he have the girl? They grow $ 50k? Does Frank get his ass beaten by Rod? Wait for the 90-minute movie to appear on the video to find out.
