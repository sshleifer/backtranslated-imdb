Just a common Jason Lee movie, were some of the funny parts of the movie. The subtlety of the movement is to live life on the edge of faith. These are the types of movies that believe that 14-year-old girls are looking at sleeping parties. It was a good movie. It's a kind of movies that you have behind the ground and look at something attracting attention from time to time. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and a plot. Only a guy meets the girl. This is the perfect movie he would show on the Central Comedy. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I'd be angry. But I think that's why I did not see her in the theater.
