"Unhinged" is a strange movie, a stunning look from the gold age of the genre. It's hard to really write a satisfactory review of this film just because the movie is so unique. The plot is quite overburdened - three young women on their way to a rock concert enters a car accident and ends at the mansion of an eccentric old lady and her daughter. Very quickly, ladies realize that something is wrong when they hear strange respirations and noises from the attic. Moreover, Mother and daughter seem to have a very strange relationship because they have a lot of trouble in front of their household at dinner. The old mother goes so far as to tell her daughter a whore and a whore and accuses her of the boys sneaking at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the movie, when a girl decides in the end that he is better off to find help, the killing begins. <br /> <br /> As for the action, the film is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three uncomfortable faces can act, especially the "lead" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear that they are giving their lines in the same wood tone throughout the film. Mom and daughter are better, but not too much. The film is also quite boring in the parts and really really pulls. Murders kill, but nothing I've seen so far. However, as mentioned here, the movie really gains points with him discreetly and disturbingly. It comes completely from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp" camp. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a cellar and suffers from a terrible and boring action, boring. The isolated, creepy manor and the dark, shining light give the film a granular realism, but it is quickly shattered when one of the characters tries to act. You might be worth it if you can leave it to the end, but I tell you that it's better to go fast forward in the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
