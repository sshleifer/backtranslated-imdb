Okay, what the hell are we doing right now? "Mount Witches" must be one of the most incoherent and crazy Spanish exploits ever and yet, at the same time, it is also strangely convincing. There is absolutely nothing to make sense here, and I doubt there was a script to work with, but in a way I could not stop it. Scratching head starts immediately, with an opening sequence of an angry little girl who killed his mother's cat. So you think this movie is revolving around children possessed by evil forces? No, no, because after this intro, her little girl and her wickedness are no longer mentioned. Then you cut into a guy with the most impressive mustache you'll ever see, who is splitting up with his girlfriend in a rather steady fashion. When asked to spend her vacation with her, he promptly calls his employer, asking him for any kind of mission! Great move. The film finally begins as it travels in an isolated mountain area to shoot some peaks. Although not before taking a new girl (Patty Shepard) and her topless photos! Throughout their journey, there are all kinds of strange events. you guessed it ?? are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, the terrible loud music plays everywhere and someone steals the jeep! Indeed, witches with trolleys? It seems that a covenant of silent wizards holds the mountains and practices voodoo on those who have broken the law. That's as close as describing the plot, but is there a good chance I'm away? More important here is the atmosphere! "Mount Witches" is occasionally very creepy, with his scary music and exciting cinema. The supporting characters seem stunning, and Patty Shepard ravist plays a good heroine. This is the type of European horror movie that could have been legendary, if only one would be disturbed to write a structured script.
