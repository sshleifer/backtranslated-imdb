Not entirely on the wall in a good, but simply stupid way. "Killer Tongue" is an anxious mix of sci-fi, horror and supposed comedy. What is equivalent to this is a mindless and totally incoherent film. Dialogue is very low, mainly because the scenario, if one exists, is completely "diving the pond". I would not even say strangely, more like a "total stupidity." This movie is sure to be disappointed and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the spicy smell will remain like the rotten fish ......................... . ..................................... MERK
