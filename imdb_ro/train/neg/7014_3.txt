What a waste! This movie might have been really decent, but writing is, in particular, shit, and the main characters are pretty superficial and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recollection of decadence at the end of the 70's was well done, but overall, this film was a great waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, dealing with similar themes and the same basic timeframe, is the great NIGHTS BOOGIE.
