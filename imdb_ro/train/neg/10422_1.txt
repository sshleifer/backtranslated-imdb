First of all, do not fret me easily ... Everything, except for a few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not right for kids at all! I opened my mouth all the time when it just shocked me. I did not realize how stupid it was for a baby movie, a bunny killed brutally! It's just useless to be so horrible and to be rated G. I recommend you to be over 8 years to see this. But do not misunderstand me, it was probably a good movie if I was not mentally scared like a child. I can not believe a parent would allow a 4-year-old to see that. It's only intense and complicated, let's not forget the gorilla, for the little ones. I'm over 4 years old and I was shocked by violence. I do not recommend
