I will say again: this movie was completely lame. Children will love, of course, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was, in principle, a revival of the original, which is to be expected because they have explored the whole concept pretty much in the first film, but have yet to rebalance the whole film? I mean, everything is re-made from Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgana, "Ursula's crazy sister," which appears from nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his trident magic. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the plot asked him to do nothing. I can go on, but I will not. Everything is a shameless attempt to bring rockets into more money from Little Mermaid and was obviously thrown away without a thought, because they knew it would sell. Generally, it's a terrible waste of time.
