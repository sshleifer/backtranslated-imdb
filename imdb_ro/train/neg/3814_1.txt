I can see the girls who enjoy this show, but calling this family show is ridiculous. I am amazed at how well she has been reminded of all these years. It is an extremely unfortunate and stupid show about the widow's father of the three who live with his dead wife's brother and his stupid boyfriend from school, and others as the seasons continue. All plot lines generally have a very bad lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with someone else and every episode they do, and ends up with an unpleasant joke. As for the actors, I did not like it either. Bob Saget was painfully unhappy as the father with the responsibilities of his mother. Dave Coulier is a 30-year-old joke who makes cartoons and behaves like a child and is horrible. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but he was so cluttered that it was hard to look at him. The oldest DJ, in the show, was a really bad actress and never showed emotions. The middle-aged girl, Stephanie, was too clich√© like an annoying sister. The youngest woman, Michelle, showed what evil actresses were the Olsen twins. You can always say when I stop them. The plot lines for too many story lines have been so unrealistically bad that they have become worthy. This is a "family" show that has tried to replace any good stuff with cuddling and love, and although they are necessary for a show about a family, they have overwhelmed too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite site in the 80s and 90s. My rating: terrible show. TVG 30 minutes.
