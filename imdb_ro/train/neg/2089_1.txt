Of course I was looking at BG. I liked S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was OK and I loved the final one. Yes, there is a spin-off show! I did not know about it at all, one of my friends told me about it. I was very excited. I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of garbage! Teenage girl fest theater. There is no fictitious science ... well, hard. At the end of each episode we can see a Cylon. That's all. Who cares this? Have they decided that the next target audience of the show will be females under 18? Puzzling religious nonsense talking, groaning, torturing ... and more. It's just sad that there's nothing there right now to look at. The old gate has ruined, BG over ...
