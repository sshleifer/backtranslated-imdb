Growing up with the transformers of the Beast War, I was not very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I have seen the wonderful movie and now that I have seen the older drawing on which I rely, I have to say that I love the original and the live action movie more than the Beast wars . Not that I do not like BW characters, I think characters such as Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "AUTOBOTE TRANSFORM and ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me think he is a true commander, more than Optimus Primal. In addition, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much stronger than Optimal Optimus. Just look at the web! <br /> <br /> The Megatron in the BW character looked more like a humorous version of his worse version in the original series. In addition to what's colder, the robots turn into animals or robots by changing vehicles and spacecraft? Gimme the Original Transformers every day over the wars with beings!
