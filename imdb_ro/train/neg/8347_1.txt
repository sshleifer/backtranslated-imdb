The title should have been the Walker. It just walked. There was nothing in the movie that was good. The film's description does not really respect the plot. The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a terrible person of life. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spend my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping it would be better ... what a mistake. It makes me worse. If there is a suggestion I can make to the producer, it is to redirect life to another area, because movies are certainly not a cup of tea
