Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few mistakes. - The screenwriter has removed two major characters from the book. - The plot was grotesque. - Voiceover sounds as if they were taken directly from the written passages (which can read well, but they are not the same when they are spoken, especially with Chabon's style). - The act is more wood than a cottage. (Esp. Bechstein) - This should be established in 1983 ??? It feels more like in 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not help watching this movie, so it is possible to redeem ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one paid to see this, or at least who read the book in the hope of a decent thing (at Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be assamed by this adaptation. No star.
