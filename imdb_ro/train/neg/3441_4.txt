What the hell was that. Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We are experiencing existential agitation with a cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled by horrible music, CGI or acting. The problem with strange narratives, like this one, is that he feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work feels the same way sometimes, and, like his interesting shows and movies, it takes too long. And unfortunately this is only 98 minutes. The distribution was attractive, and that's the limit. I suppose it touches the teens' feelings and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it does not make the characters happy enough to care for their fate ... whatever they are. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
