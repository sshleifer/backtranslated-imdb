I have always been frustrated with films that were clearly written by a single genre. Especially when obviously they do not do enough research to find out when not only does it sound real, but also false rings. The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football colleagues that they took Diane pregnant. In no way, form or shape, a guy would ever make another guy to get a high school pregnant girl. They may be proud of the guy who has sex with the hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team has heard it will not be a urinal. It was obvious that this movie did not make you so serious, and it was not bad, but come on!
