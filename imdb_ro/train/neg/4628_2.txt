Misty Ayers had a smoker body, and this is all about this movie. Pure exploitation exploitation. I started playing with myself, counting me how many times they had their orchestral music. And, of course, music has nothing to do with the scenes. The case concerned: Walking in a room and saying that "Hello" was marked with chase music from a Roman epic. I would like to know why this film has been on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this film: that low play pantsuits existed in 1954. I speak Sigourney Weaver in the original pants of Alien. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leaving easily and dressed clothing (except for the bra and panties, unfortunately). It also includes a terrible doubling, leading to a "Caution! Godzirra!" effect.
