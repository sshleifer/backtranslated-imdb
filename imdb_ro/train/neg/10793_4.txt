I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novel by science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, united twins who are snatched out of their family by an impresario to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, the movie is also too clever in half (if you forgive the paper). By blending genres, styles and mood, directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose their way quite quickly. I was never sure if I had to take them seriously or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, was just a little bit too much. Besides, rock promised just did not move me. I was reminded too much of Hedwig and Angry Inch, a movie we found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not as good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. A more unfavorable comparison would be the similar disappointment of Velvet Goldmine.
