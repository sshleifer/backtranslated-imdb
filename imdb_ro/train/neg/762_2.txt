Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that prevented me from giving this terrible image (1). (So ​​loyalty to Mr. Falk was what made me watch this movie all the way from head to foot.) Even if you forgive all the wrong mistakes, it was just the worst excuse for a TV set "Columbo" ever. I'm glad to have watched on free TV; he would have hated the dollars to print.
