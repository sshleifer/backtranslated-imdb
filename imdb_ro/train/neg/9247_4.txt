"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. While these groups of films are more noticeable than their 1914 colleagues, it seems a little below average. The twin vault combined with the lucky end and the lucky end that makes Charlie wake up from a dream of stroking the lead lady's hair just to sprinkle the head of a mop he used as a pillow, classic Chaplin. They are both ironic both the beginning and the end. The middle is complemented by the struggle with the college rival architect and the bust of a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the biggest physical element of this film, and Charlie uses it to experience a comic effect, whether it's the character's intent or not. The mop appears to be Charlie's alter ego by doing the things he wants, but he would not be with both hands. That's interesting, but it's better.
