Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered from a complex of inferiority, I hate to leave the house, talk to new people, and I had an overwhelming sense that people hate me. However, after seeing an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my fortune began to change. After the episode 2, I started running for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes, and I actually felt gifted. When the series had finished, she was driving the sales department at work, hitting a lot of women and winning the karaoke contest on the spot. If you've ever had a trusted crisis and you do not know where to go back then take a trip to Poundland and pick up the DVD is just 99p.
