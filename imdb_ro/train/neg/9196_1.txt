This is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it was so bad that it seemed comic. First, there is no plot. The actors seem to read books and make the foolish things. How would they be watched by dead people but who still want to come out and look for their friends. Zombies were also terrible, not where almost as fun as any of Romero's work, which becomes a plug in the movie. And the worst part of everyone was that video snapshots appeared in action sequences. Like we do not have the video game, it's about zombies. Also, all 20 things some how they know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without straightening even with the gun. And the way people die is so bad. It's like he could get rid of ammo, so he's waiting to be jumping. And when they are stabbed in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of pulling the open door, so stupid. VERDICT FINAL: If any of these actors appear in another movie then they were blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I have seen over the years. A B movie on the cinema is better.
