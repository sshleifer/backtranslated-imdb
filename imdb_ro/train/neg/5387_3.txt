In a moment when it seems to have become interesting, she never got there. People go from one point to another, really without any point (if it was a very boring one). There was no action, suspense, or any horror, and the characters were pretty hearts, so there was no thought about what happened to them. Everybody was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I am giving a 3/10. I liked it was not a shaky camera and if it was music did not annoy me like bad movies and the action was not terrible.
