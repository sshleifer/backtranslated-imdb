This was one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. I usually praise a movie for an aspect of his production, but the intense irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made it hard to appreciate any part of this film. The most common was the deduction that the man who designed the building was guilty of an avalanche that collapses. OK. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to ski a slalom style avalanche will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Get out of here. As I mentioned earlier, the innate gentleness and pure stupidity of some characters are ridiculous. In a closed, oxygen-restricted room, a four-year-old can tell you that starting a fire is not a good idea. However, about 5 minutes of the film is redeemed and gains appreciation. However, if you have a modicum of intelligence, you will also find most of this hard-to-tolerant film. It takes me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like that. Did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook you must continue to watch to see the latest techniques of combative avalanche. Absolutely useless.
