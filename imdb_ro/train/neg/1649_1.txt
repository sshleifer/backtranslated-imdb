Every Sunday, a trio of buds gather at a New York dinner to boast about their sexual conquest the night before. Sometimes a new ex-fellow and hunter hunter joins them, who clings to them as a diligent. There are dogs with horns and corn dogs, and Mia, who sees their witnesses, decides that a lesson must be taught, hell. Ergo, she will meet and throw - why not? All three of them! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a wandering, naughty galac. Women now have the right to meet and sleep in everything they want. As much as men, even! <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculously ridiculous element in "Whipped" - that not once during the amigo's detailed discussions about their bodily functions and tantric talents of the bed partners, they destroy the other clients in the restaurant turns around and says, "Man, we're trying to eat here." Indeed, a heh-heh gang has an older lady enthusiastically weighing on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages. A big fat Kermit Frog "Sheesh" to that. It is truly unfortunate that a friend-in-a-movie friend, a smart, cute, and three-pairs heroine had to have such an overwhelming sense. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects for the screenwriter to use the phrase "You Go, the Face". He was tired in 2000, and he's tired now. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch some "Sex and the City" rerun ...
