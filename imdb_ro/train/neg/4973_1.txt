I stopped for five minutes when Beowulf received a double-arched double-barrel with his eyes on him. Not only do the crossbows have telescopic telescopes, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The terrible, the wooden effect and the everlasting darkness that affects all the original Sci-Fi movies did not help either. Having just a few minutes before I feel my balls stand up and decided to look at I Love Lucy back in, that's really all I have to say. But, you might realize it's a movie made for television and jump over it. A transvestite.
