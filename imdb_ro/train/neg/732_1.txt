A little boy sees that his mother is murdered, and his father hangs. 20 years later, he gets a lot of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so that he will not prove like his father. All stock characters are in place: beautiful couple; the "funny" type; harsh (but sensitive) hood; smart girl (she wears glasses - so we know); the nerd and two blondes without personality. Everything involves a bad wooden statue that comes to life (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I had problems when, after a big opening scene, we were 20 years later - ALL bad horror films do that! Dialogue is atrocious, the act is bad (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?), And killing is bad and / or unimaginable. My favorite scene is when two people are supposed to have sex and the statue beats the guy on the bed to show he's completely dressed! A horror film, bad, stupid and incoherent. Avoid at all costs.
