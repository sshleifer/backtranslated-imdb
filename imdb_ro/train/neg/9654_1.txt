The movie is very bad. Simply horrible. The row of bad movies at Bollywood has no end! They have to apologize for making such terrible movies (or not). The problem seems to be mainly with directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver performance ... but they were so poorly justified. The poor scenario did not help the same. This movie has ridiculous moments and very poor editing in the first half. For example: After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, he meets Om Puri (from whom he fled 30 years ago and spoke again), and Om Puri finds friendship with Salman !!! What a load of nonsense. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. What happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? Ajay Devgun is a total miscast for portraying a rockstar. Only thanks to rescue are good performances in the second half. Ajay shines while his character shows his dark side. And Salman is the drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look, maybe, just for the last half hour.
