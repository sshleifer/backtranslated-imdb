Obviously, when you offer a sufficient money actor, they will do everything. I do not know how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he would have had to go to his fans as an excuse because they were even associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of the 1950s, and the action of the rest of the cast was even worse. As to how bad the act of being a child gave the best second performance in my opinion. English was extremely accentuated and I think nobody could speak English, but they just memorized how words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their characters both "alive" and real .
