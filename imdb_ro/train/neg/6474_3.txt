This was the first sequel I've seen (besides Jafar's Return), and I thought honestly to see it be almost original. I was horribly disappointed. The story was basically the first scenario with a few extra characters and the situation came back. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who is not happy with land life. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept the past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds out she's upset and upset. And then she decides to run and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around and Ariel wants to find her - like a mermaid. The story does not sound badly written, but the cliches and repeats of the first movie are just too obvious. And adding that Melody is generally extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There is also a whole load of other new characters - Tip and Dash being two of them. They are not too bad as characters themselves - just try not to think about Timon or Pumbaa! Songs leave much to be desired, they simply do not have the same magical energy as original pieces. The animation, obviously, had no complete workload placed in it-half the parts, and not much imagination is used for character movements. Another Advice - Try to forget about Ariel's Original Character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager "grew up" in a wife and a boring, dull mother, and her red, commercial hair is all about it. This is much better seen if you have not seen the original - you will not have anything to compare with it. However, overall, it could have been worse - it's not as bad as some other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But for your collection, unless Disney goes on like that, they'll lose all of their older fans.
