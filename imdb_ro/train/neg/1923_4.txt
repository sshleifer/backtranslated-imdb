It is ironic that Dr. Seuss's storyline stating that Christmas should not be commercialized should be one of the most impressed, marketed and successful successes of the holiday season. The general taste of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's vows against Christmas come from an early childhood incident and that Whos are caught up in the materialism of the season, except for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an ambitious and ambitious attempt to capture Seuss's impetuosity and sense of storyline, but the end result is a shining film that never packs the emotional fist of Chuck Jones's animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his diabolical Grinch, but no matter if it is the dialogue, the rhythm or the extraordinary stories that have gathered on the original plot, the transformation from the miserable bitter to the merciful benefactor does not convincingly arise. There are some wonderful pictures and makeup work is amazing, but beyond the technical triumph, there is an element or two missing here. Briefly? <br /> <br /> Soul? Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation too well in his 25-minute drawing, about which Howard fails in a movie that feels for three hours. Howard, Carey and the crew are very capable and talented, but what would seem to be a winning combination is only weak and fruitful in the end product. If you need to see the long-lasting version, you can rent it on Jones's animated video and you can see how bigger and brighter it is not always better. I give this film three Cine-Hash glasses out of five.
