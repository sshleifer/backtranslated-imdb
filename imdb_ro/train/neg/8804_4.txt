The extraordinary effects of CGI and a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-piece trick in this movie, as he got the best Oscar actor last year, in which Morgan Freeman was a murder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring love letter for the baby boom generation, with a barely hidden right-wing bias, starting with Forrest's Vietnam service until the "resolution" with Jenny at the end. With this the thing said, though, it is very fun and an American movie through and through. We have discovered some parts of this extremely offensive film, Zemeckis rises down on this film almost to Gump himself. . . Perhaps this was the point he is trying to do. Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what a good American does?" Forrest seems to have made the "right" choices and has been in "the right place at the right time" for the past 45 years. Those who are wrong with the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So, Zemeckis says that the idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even American, quality?
