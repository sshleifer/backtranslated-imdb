I have to admit that I am a great fan of this show, so you have to know how disappointed I am when I watched this movie. First, the plot was terrible, I thought it would be more interesting to see what had happened to Arnold's parents or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house in many other places, so many people are trying to stop this. I must admit that the intrigue was not so bad after all, but what was really aspired were the steps Arnold and his friends are doing to stop this maniac, friends of a spy; I'm driving a bus (based on a video game for God's sake) and worse, doing super-moves on the bus, things many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga are experts on a video game. Frankly, my mom, my sister, I really disappointed myself after watching this movie, because it was the worst way to finish a very good cartoon. I have to admit that I enjoyed "Hey Arnold!" It was one of my favorite drawings on Nickelodeon, but after this movie shit I'm not sure if I'm going to watch "Hey Arnold!" as we have seen in the past. Another thing, Nickelodeon, with that enormous number of dynamite, I can assure you that it will not explode a simple street, I think the whole city could explode with this, oh, and please, if all your future movies from good cartoons will be so do not make more movies, give a bad critic to cartoons that were good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to end this show, a good show turned into this movie carp.
