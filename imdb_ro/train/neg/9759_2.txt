It's rare to feel the need to write a review on this site, but this movie is highly deserved because of how bad it was created and how much its product was. I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as heroic and unreliable. We hear him talking about the sadness he feels from oppression, but the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel that the politically oppressed population is the Israeli Jewish population. We do not see evidence parallel to the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear other Palestinians in prison. I understand there are restrictions, but the political nature of the restrictions is meant to hinder peace. I came out of the movie, feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in mourning and completely shut off because of her fence, so to speak. She continued to not be willing to see the bombers' parents hurt, and her angry and closed words made the final meeting come out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see that the Israeli mentality is a root of the problem; the reasons ignored for understanding and freedom, ignored the demands of recognition of the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. I gave this two because of the mother's selfish weaknesses, which would normally be admirable in a documentary, however, in light of the lack of impartiality, everything seems to be exploiting. Also for bad editions, lack of background in the present case and, finally, lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. Finally, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I admit that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I have to notice the flaws in the direction regardless of the subject of the heart problem and the sadness.
