this is the first time I write a comment on a IMDb movie. but I had to write it for it. 3 hours of unapplied torture. from the beginning u get the idea that the movie will be bad. the act is pathetic. I am a great fan of Ajay devgan (loves him in bhagat singh), but he is the worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non-actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director did it in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow I felt the ram tried to repeat a sarkar, color theme, background score, room angles, but it did not work. PLEASE HERE!
