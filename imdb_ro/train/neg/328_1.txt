I'm a huge fan of Adam Sandler and someday I looked at the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and I saw "Going Overboard" and decided to rent it. So I went out with some of my friends and rented it. We put it and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler who did not hit puberty yet, looks like he was 12 years old when this movie came out. I could not even look for 30 minutes of this stupidity, I was not laughing, chuckling, I did not even look at this movie, actually the only time I turned my back on when I saw how dreadful this movie was. I could not believe how hard the spectators tried to laugh in this movie ... and never went. Although I have seen why I have never heard of this movie, because I realized the terrible blinds of the cameras and heard the disgusting scenario ... because it's more gloomy than it has ever blown before. This movie, in my opinion, was the best movie ever made, .... EVER!
