I took this movie in the hope that it would be like the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended by the way). Bath, disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office, but fails to deliver. The reason is partly rigid drive, but especially writing and direction. True, it may be fun to use every clich√© singing about role plays, but here it is made to make it extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you know what will be "joke". But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is shown on the top. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there were subtitles "LAUGH NOW" or a cheap 80s song of laughter, it would not be too important. With some scenes, you can not help thinking "Yeah, I understand why they thought it would be funny," but how it gets executed takes all the impulses from the possible joke.
