When you give a "art movie" 1/10, you have people who get your ignorant, semi-assaulted, artistically retarded blood. I will not try to justify how an aesthetically delayed delay is by enrolling in all the "art cinemas" I liked or that I mentioned as I gave them a "classical classic cult" unknown 10/10. All I ask is someone to explain the point, purpose and message of this film. Here's how I would summarize the film: The opening of three unrelated urban legends describing almost absurd levels of co-incidence. This followed (briefly, to save you three hours of pain) the following: - A host of a children's game that died of lung cancer is trying to pack things with its coke-dependent daughter, who can or did not violate when she was a child and who is courted by a relationship police officer, while the show's contestant decides she does not want to be a wonderful child, a fate that had In another game, competitors in the 1960s, which we see now, are a job-free homosexual in love with a bartender with straps and who needs money for "corrective oral surgery", while the producer of the gambling show himself dying of lung cancer, he patches it with the son he abandoned years ago and who later became a self-help guru even if the producer's second wife suffers of torment of guilt because he deceived a man to death; and, finally, frogs are raining (read correctly). And I'm getting rid of the incredibly long and useless monologs, literally full of story, each character seems to come with his hand without a rhyme or any other reason than to make sure the movie goes for 3 hours and becomes classified as a "modern epic" ". You probably think I could have done a better job of summarizing the film (and, in turn, not bothering you) if I wrote that less coherent, perhaps in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
