Scary .. Da Scary !! Jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to weak people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nude beach in SA I first saw this movie two years ago - it's safe to say that it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school The next day. This movie was horrible! A romantic comedy - just a window of nudity! This movie hit her lower point with one of the new-age characters staring between the girls' feet. Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think we found the sky. If you do not want to hear amateur actors talk about topics such as furting, adultery, and the overlapping of your genitals. AVOID!
