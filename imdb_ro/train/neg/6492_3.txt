I was not entirely sure what to expect from a genre of Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, but, given the actors involved, I thought I'd give it a spin. The tone of the movie felt strange, passing through patches of every genre, but never felt balanced, so I finally gave up the test and focused on the cinema and the individual performances that I thought I was good overall, had a little depth due to the nature of the story (it will not give anything here). I have to say that it felt much longer than the 96-minute execution time, and not in a good way. Finally, I was looking for the closure, a certain degree of satisfaction, but it did not turn out to be an intelligent or ingenious piece that we thought it would be. I think Tony mistakenly believed what he did at the end of the movie gave us this ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. Finally I feel cheated. IMO would have been better off letting it endlessly as a piece of art ... just. Or ... you may have completely lost the point :)
