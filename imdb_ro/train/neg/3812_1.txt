Full House is one of the worst TV ever! Because all the characters are so irritating that it is impossible to bear. The best character is Joey, even if he is quite irritated occasionally. to mention when Danny begins his philosophy. Example: DJ earned about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, he does not have eighteen years, so he should not play in accordance with the law. ready to pay her money, but then Danny, her father asked her and did not let them raise that money because she was not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, okay? Since I've seen that stupid and childish scene the scene has instantly stopped the TV. Some things they say in this series, not even one child would have bought. Who could believe in the world that the Full House is fun and funny? Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote. Except that Shakespeare knew how to write, and except that it would not be that little kid and stupid to write something just as bad as they wrote in the script for the Full House ! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any life will or any sense of the real world, I strongly recommend "Do not look at the Full House"! episode as a try. Avoid this series. Beware of stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies then. Do not forget this. "
