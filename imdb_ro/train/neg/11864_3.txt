characters at deep deep cuts. you've seen all the characters in other movies, I promise you. the script tries to be nervous and uncomfortable, but failed. threw a hangover meets comedy Superbad, but jokes are way out in left field completely forced and are disreguarded almost completely after being cracked. hot babe is old and has no personality, shes just a few first thirty years old blonde blonde with a few wise bottomless underwear wearing jokes that is less than cute. attraction of Molly (hot chick) and Kirk (dorky love interest) is only communicated. attraction where there is a completely platonic relationship until inconvenient and predictable seat belt- kissing incident. however, they are in a relationship full of relationships and just incredibly lame. The main objective of this film is the relationship, but trying to create a super-bad vulgar film Esquire, a semi attractive field. I could compare this with the hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into this. I could go on, but just useless. just do not pay to see this movie.
