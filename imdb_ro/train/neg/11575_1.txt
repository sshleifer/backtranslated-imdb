I was familiar with the fantastic book of "Goodnight Mister Tom" of absolute age and just recently I had the chance to look at this adaptation. I have heard many positive remarks about this, so I had great hopes. Once this movie is over, I was terrified. This movie is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and practically 4.5 / 10 of the book was missed. In particular, I found that a lot of characters and some extraordinary scenes in the book were not in this respect. Dialogue was not too big, it was rushed and too fast, but I was more upset that you never saw the connection and love between William Beech and Tom in this movie that was a real disappointment. Also pouring was not so good. I thought it might have been great, but it was so different from the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst we've ever seen. This deserves a decent remake that would be better than 1000 times better than this garbage can.
