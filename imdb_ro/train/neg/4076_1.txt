This topic deserves a much better scenario and an end result than this movie serves. The script is full of holes, because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a series of nightmare scenarios knit together. Gaps and gaps in the story line are numerous. The scene in which the kidnapped victim is informed that her parents are not dead and has been seeking her since she was taken is just strange. It is written as a moment of cathartic therapy with the head of the shelter because the fugitives give it a "missing poster" since she was eight years old. In the real world, if the head of a fugitive shelter learned that he had, under his roof, a kidnapping resolved, what would have been next would have been an immediate appeal to the police. It's a matter of law enforcement, not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that results from here to the end is a short time, so I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for pure free operation. Funny, this should condemn this movie. Eventually they seem to have joined.
