Final score (an average of different classic cinematic qualities - actors, visuals, creativity, payments, humor, fun, etc.): 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" for a few years, it would have seemed a bold, seriously new direction in Disney animation. However, it comes just one year after the innovator and genius "The Emperor's New Groove" and marks a step back in Disney's release of the "Disney Formula" repeat. I'm a big fan of Disney animated films. You have to see all those who love or hate her. "Atlantis" is an animated cast of "20,000 leagues under the sea" and adventures of sci-fi adventures in the 50's and 60's. The problem is that this version hardly contains an original idea. It feels like a remake of something even more than the current Disney remakes (Tarzan, Hunchback of Notre Dame). Characters are a little more than a walking clich√© of the usual suspects who usually populate these types of movies (the weird mechanic, the general gang, the tough women). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the supportive distribution is full of heart. The film also suffers from its brief rhythm. Instead of packing it into an epic storyline, Disney beats a lot in short time usually, wandering the opportunity to develop ... suspense, characters, something really. They give us this new and wonderful world and they just let us down. The strange rhythm sometimes makes it confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and cumbersome and cheap. This looks like a morning cartoon, a week in the morning. Let's hope they have not forgotten that the traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. The "iron giant", among other things, has demonstrated this. Negatives: visual, rhythm and lack of originality. Positive: Very likely the hottest death scene for a bastard Disney over a long time. It's the climax of the movie.
