Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be, a paradise of horror genre that tried to be smart by referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I do not shout "Scream," as I think Scream is a very good horror movie that does a great job of mixing horror and comedy. Cut does not succeed at most levels. It has moments, but it generally does not work, not even a "so bad is good" movie, just one under the media. The first five minutes are all right and they set the story pretty well, except that Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically, she pulls out her tongue, her figure. Go ahead and a group of movie students want to finish the movie, which is apparently cursed. And, as you probably predicted, one by one, distribution and crew are slowly taken by a masked madman. A non-original plot, a bad action and a predictable end are some of the following. There are a lot of references in the movie, everything from "Scream" to "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". Also, this is not smart, it feels like the director wanted to feel smart and cool, mentioning other Scream horror films. For a slasher there is a minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher who does not have much for him. Indeed, I should support this film because I am Australian and we are not that good when it comes to horror (but we have our stones though) but Cut is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, they've made me look for 90 minutes or so, so it's at least good. I would not recommend this to anyone except the hardcore slasher fans who might appreciate what this movie is trying to do, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
