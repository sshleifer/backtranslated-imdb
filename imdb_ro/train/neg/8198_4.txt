Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: It's me or any movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico sucks. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with all the beach stuff, the Andromeda strain, Missing Art Raiders' class scene and a throw in a small gate to boot. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this movie. Of course, with nothing original wisely shared they have the gore fingerprint and the right sex? Nope gore is a blink and you miss the deal and sex is all. (James Spader mentions that he needs a shower, and Leslie Stefanson, delightedly, asks him to join.) In fact, if a movie ever needed a shower scene to live up to it. I mean if you're going to have awesome women in white swimsuit wandering around an Antarctic research base why it's not going to break. With about 30 seconds of real emotion in the entire Alien Hunter movie it is remarkably serious and slow for a science fiction adventure. It needed a better turn of the plot to deliver it, and how the Alien itself is a terrible clich√© and has no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also wondered during the viewing of what the children of corn are in the reason of space. (Remember that since Jason on Friday, the third fame, Pinhead of Hellraiser and that Leprechaun all traveled in space to kill the teenage girls why not the corn field?) Characters on the horn dress like Logan's Run Extract and we were just waiting for strains to come alive and attack them. However, this would have been exciting and apparently against this film covenant. The actor is the best while Spader resumes Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser are shaping the latest beachwear model in the Antarctic. John Lynch still read the script and acts like a crazy mad long before the story told him. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a slogan derived from disappointment that makes me eat for a Space Maiden Copper Film.
