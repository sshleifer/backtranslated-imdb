This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The action is poor, and the story is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like sailing ships or ships, it's irrelevant. As for the special effects the film has none. The entire movie team was probably on the boat off the beach rather than in a studio, and when some men are "stabbed" (if you can even say that), their reactions are totally unreal. Weapons are quieter than a mute. How this movie could have two awards puts serious questions at the state of the human mind. That's about it. This review is probably more readable than the movie is being watched. If someone intends to pursue or buy it, I would strongly advise against it for obvious reasons. I said he included a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a gun is fired is a paradise. I suppose it's because they are the only good parts of the movie.
