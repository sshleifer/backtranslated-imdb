Who in the world told Harrison Ford that this is a good role for him? And Josh Hartnett ... how has a 19-year-old who can not shoot a gun to become a cop? Over the used rattles, plus the development of zero characters and about 15 unnecessary music industry cameo equals a surprisingly bad movie !!!
