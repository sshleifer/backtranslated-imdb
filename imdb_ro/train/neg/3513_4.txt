Jeremy Northam is fighting against a clone script "Total Recall" and a disposable romantic game to bring the life of a confused character. Lucy Liu is releasing his role from a wooden start to a worker-like finish. You can not laugh when you see your DVD interviews when using the terms "Femme fatal" and "Romance". French actress-noir actress is not and lacks chemistry together. This film does not succeed, not in plot or sequences of action, but in the lack of attention to detail in the photo film and the ham-fisted portrayal of the technology world around the main protagonists. There is a small attempt to dress up the landscape to represent any contiguous landscape or period of film. The cars are very 1990s and the only modern architecture with open plans that point to a narrow budget, rather than dedicated set dressing techniques. The technology is positively hilarious. Massive "2001: An Odyssey Space," powered by portable human CD-ROMs, with data gathered for unexplained reasons, despite the proliferation network that even the most unhappy technologist today would obviously be aware of. There is a clear lack of research done here, and given the open source nature of the cyber community, research would have cost a little more than a bulletin board and personal time. DVD interviews also reveal the original name of the movie was "Om Company", but this was probably canceled to make money on Matrix Hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest link to the movie. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely re-wrote the Decalogue. This is the quality of the film and extremely disappointing film production. It might have made a good sub-plot for the "Alias".
