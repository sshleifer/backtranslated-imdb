Vineyard Eye (1999) is a very bad movie. The premise was real good, but the overall execution was just terrible. I wanted the producers to have spent time with this project instead of hurrying it into production. A blind guy gets some new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to an old medieval werewolf. Thundering things begin to happen to the guy as he turns into a creature presented in rough form. Can he find a remedy before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who's the weird little troll who helps him and what's going on with that cop? If you really want to know, check the Wizard's Eyes! It's not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to have spent a lot of time in pre-production before deciding to film the film.
