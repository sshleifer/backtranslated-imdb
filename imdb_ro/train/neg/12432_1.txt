This is the worst rip of the Home Alone movies I've ever seen! Look at Part 1 and 2, but do not let anyone say it's better than the first two! I mean, really do not make a movie, then make a sequel to the same characters and actors, then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I mean, it would have been OK if this movie was not a "Home Alone" movie, but they made it a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old now, so you think you have no success! Okay, this movie makes me sick! Buy parts 1 and 2.
