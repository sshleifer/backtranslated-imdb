The Brothers Quay are directors, judging by a conventional thought, they should have made some short films. In fact, I really liked their first feature, the Benjamenta Institute, but judging by the effort of the second earth quake tuner, I am willing to agree that they are not approaching the equation of their past genius to length. The piano tuner is undoubtedly a great movie to watch, and often to listen. Unfortunately, it is extremely painful to stay with complicated narrative and glacial rhythm. Reading the synopsis, it seems like a fairly good story. But the brothers do not manage to bring it to life at all. One thing you should consider to be completely avoidable in the future: dialogue. God, it's terrible here. A huge bust.
