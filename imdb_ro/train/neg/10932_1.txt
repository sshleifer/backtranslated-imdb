The really sad thing is that it was supposed to be the biggest budget with which Halestorm Entertainment worked. All involved should be fined for waste because all the celluloid they waste is good for nothing more than garbage filling. Not only are the writings atrocious, but also horrible jokes, but the quality of the film and the quality of the film are, at best, amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was created on a laptop laptop type. The worst part of all is that I actually stood by the whole thing. I think precisely because I could not believe that I actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was actually watching was actually accepting the "movie."
