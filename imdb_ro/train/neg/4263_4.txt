The film is disappointing. Actor's performance is poor. The sets are good, it could have been better. The story is also weak. The battle sequences are terrible. Sounds and film quality are unsafe. The history of the Kazakh people has been said very badly. This film should have included several Kazakh actors in mainstream roles. And it should also have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic origins. I do not understand. Since the Hispanic people have played the Turkish-Mongolian people. This movie is shameful by the Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Director Czekh is excused because he is not of nomadic origin, can not know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
