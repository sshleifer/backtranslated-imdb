I'm a great fan of David Lynch and have everything he did on DVD, except for the hotel and Twin Peaks for 2 hours. So when we found out about it, I took it right away and ... and ... what is it? It's a bunch of black and white cartoons that are loud and steady. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe that's just a bunch of nonsense that was shot by the public under David Lynch's name to make a few bucks. Allow me to say that I do not care about the wrong language part, but I had to keep in mind the sound, because my neighbors could. All this is an extremely disappointing version and could just be left in the luxury box set as a curiosity. I recommend you not to spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.
