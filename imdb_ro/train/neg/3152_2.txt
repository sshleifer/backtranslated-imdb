Very structured, badly written, loaded with a cliche and flat dialogue. No scene shines. The actors are struggling with a painfully dull scenario, which manages to completely avoid any surprises, plotting or conflicts. You know from the first ten minutes where it goes. For a film set up in New York, he has almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other indie films that make it look magical on a small budget. Looks like he was shot in Toronto. If you played Natasha Henstridge, why embrace her in luggage sweaters? Why do you make Vartan boring? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was looking at a Christian sub-partisan movie of the week that was so asexual and moralizing. Steven Feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this film gentle.
