Some people seem to think this is the worst movie they've ever seen and I know where I come from, but I've even been worse. After that, the movies I can remember (that is, those I have not blocked), which were worse than these, were so bad that they physically suffered all the senses involved in watching the movie. Movies that are worse than War Games 2 are those that make you want to get your eyes off or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep from having another piece of your soul pulled from you by horror. > <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I did not expect wonders from this. Facing the original was not really such a great movie, first, it was just a teenage 80's campy movie, with some geek calling to him. That's all I hoped for, something bad, but that could have fished my fingers. Was it too much to ask for? Is it really impossible to do better than original war games, even for a direct video release? Apparently, it was too much to ask for. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, "Oh yes, it's bad, but I'm glad, maybe the end will be good as it was in the original." And then it gets worse, and to the end, believe me, you will not want to see this movie.
