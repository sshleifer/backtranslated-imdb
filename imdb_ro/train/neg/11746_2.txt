Well, this movie certainly had a sum of hype; From the noise from the Toronto Film Festival to the overflow of reviews on CBC radio. A cool, hideous and hilarious indie film apparently. We have been looking forward to this for months. How can I say that simply? To suck in a very great way. A cinematic film exercise that makes Adam Sandler look like a genius of comics. At best, it was slightly funny and the worst caused the coma. An amerterist scenario pointing stupidly and overturned into an unpleasant mess. And what was the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track? That was the only really weird thing about it. If you want to see a really fun, bizarre movie that involves aliens, then try Repoman. There is no comparison!
