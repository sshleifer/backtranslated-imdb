This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen throughout the year. <br /> <br /> First, I will say that the actor was very good and by all those who participated. it seems to have been very inappropriate and, in this regard, has succeeded. In the same way, the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a lying chronicler overwhelmed and without talent, whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. It was worse than watching a car wreck.
