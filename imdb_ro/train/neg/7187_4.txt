Here we go with another Slasher movie, people who look good and acting from everyone was very good! A few kids playing farsa phones call and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the children! 20 years after they're still friends, go to a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Again, they start making phone calls again everywhere! and then the killer comes back kills them off one by one and the killer is in BLACK Coat with ax, like Urban Legend, Death scene really strange, indeed strange times too. <br /> <br /> The beautiful slasher movie on this side would give 7/10 but the twist at the end of the film made the whole movie pretty useless Twisting has killed the movie for me so I will give it 4/10
