I remember our parents do not understand Saturday night when they were 15 years old. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I get close to their age, I still remember and find that I understand many of the things my children love. But this is pathetic. I can not say I saw Sarah, except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see it as something special. But this performance is just as much as I expected from it. The IMDb script has made it seem potentially. So, just for this, I started watching the first episode. I halted it half. Anything else is better than that. Banknotes that are intended for a 5-year-old person presented on an adult-assisted program. Well, Sarah, this adult is moved to disable you. I can only believe that someone has financed this insult to comedy. The only good thing I can say is there is a lot of bad joke here, saving other shows from such embarrassment.
