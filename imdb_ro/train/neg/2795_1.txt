Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in his mouth, blowing his head on his friend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was a singer of a rock band "Demons and Death," who could not shake the sad feelings of her friend's negligence over her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve something other than to put a bullet through my head yours). She returns, however, possessing the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her girlfriend who will replace her vocalist, so the group can finish the album off Cassidy's early death. But Cassidy made a deal with the dark one, and the souls must be collected. She is consumed by this rage mainly to Neal, but all the members of the band or anyone in the music studio gets dead when they're the prey to whom they think she's upsetting Dora .. not Cassidy returns for damping. The micro-budget horror movement seems to be cheap, has a cheap distribution that should make plans in another line of work, and boasts cheap killer scenes Not effective.
