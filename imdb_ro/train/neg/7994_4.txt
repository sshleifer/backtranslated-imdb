A rather worthless film made for the television movie that closely follows the murderer's insect scenario. Antre is mysteriously transformed into killer ants near a hotel. I think there is food at the hotel, because the hotel's canal drains directly into the ants bed. There is a lack of suspense in this movie and it is not scary. Watching a bunch of ants that hit their victims is not very terrifying. The Spoilers section of the hero is almost incredible. He was told that the health inspector that ants could not be the hero. It must be a mysterious virus. Once the inspector says this, the hero carries his bulldozer and destroys the immense colony of ants. This disturbs millions of ants and traps people at the hotel. <br /> <br /> Shutting down spoilers In general, this movie is extremely blade. I do not understand why he received a DVD version when there are not so many meritorious movies. My only presumption for the release of the DVD is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the movie. This is a film to avoid.
