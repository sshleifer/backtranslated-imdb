Well, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, thinking it was terrible fun. That's what it is, without fun. This movie is really mindless, it is devoid of any plot or character development, or any kind of story. The basic problem with this movie is killing and gorilla. Virtually every killing looks exactly the same. Zombies break someone apart. Yeah, it's fine, but you also need some original kilos. I mean, it was really the blade, every killing looks exactly the same, shot exactly the same way. That killed me. I like gore, and gore in this movie did nothing for me. It was just boring. No story, just the same scene tormented again and again with another person. I also wanted to like this movie. I like shooting gore video ... like Redneck Zombies. But I could not change my mind. This movie has good points, but none of them is in the movie. I understand that many of the "zombies" have helped her with the floods, and it has happened over 100 zombies, which is cool enough as so many people have been involved and helped in the world. But, in general, this is a terrible movie.
