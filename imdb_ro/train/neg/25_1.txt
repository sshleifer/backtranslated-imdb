Sometimes a movie is so terrible that it has a destructive effect on your morale. Start wondering, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so low? Can we honestly expect that we will bear these many cliques and we will continue to have fun? Of course, it's still a support from Hollywood to make GUN the main character, the plotting device and the source of all conflict and movie resolution. The character needs a weapon. He has a weapon. He can not do this because he has a weapon. First put the gun down. Oh, my God, what will we do! He has a weapon! He turns it around, acting worse than real human beings do. He pushed him in front of someone for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The distinctive sign of any conclusion will be the convincing sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It's a real challenge to make a fatigue formula again; a movie must be very smart and well executed. This is none. He has no life and no personality, and will suck these components from you. will make you feel LIGHT to live in the time and space you make. Indeed, who needs this! So yes, I'll say: I think this movie could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone involved in making this sub-mediocre chocolate garbage should be entangled in public for the service they have done for all of us.
