I watched Grendel last night and I forced to put together a Public Service Announcement. Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the ancient Anglo-Saxon epic poem of a thousand years. The SciFi Channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting films, and the preview has promised a non-existent mini-epic with a low budget, but it refused to allow me to change the channels. It was amazing, overwhelming, bad. I looked in fascination and horror at the train wreck, which you could not destroy your eyes. I touched a notepad and I managed to capture some of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or save health. You were warned. Just to succeed, Beowulf's fighters wore horns. The trivial problem compared to what came after. It seems that the helmets were in a trash bin and handed them to the other actors strayed by the next. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. Marina Sirtis was obviously blackmailed to make the film by Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns have already done the rest of her makeup. Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as a king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become the king of the Danes just minutes before the movie opened and did not have the chance to get a resized crown to fit it yet. at their waiting tables, none had to change their hairstyle at all. Variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to divert attention from dialogue. To prove that it was a multi-national distribution, everyone was encouraged to keep any emphasis they chose. - As is typical with this type of movie (at least from Mad Max). In this case, it was weird, it did not fit and was new. The feminine love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long-standing tradition of hotties that should be seen with the completely disabled volume. The unintentional focus of the film was a combined, repeating crossbow with exploding bolts. He never had to be loaded and even had a kickback when he was fired. He succeeded in destroying the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical and suspenseful facts. <br /> <br /> - Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, rather than being a long Norwegian, seems to have been designed and built by artisans who have sunk with Atlantis. Beowulf arrived in the Danish countryside in a two-dimensional crossed vessel, originally part of a set, the other two being Santa Maria and Pinta. Prince Unferth noticed the approach of Beowulf's ship using a telescope. Before you can recover from this amazing innovation, you must see the ship from its point of view. Judging from the angle, the prince was in a plane of a kind. Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as in a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the breathing of the actors, whether inside or outside. - Fun 2: Dark dance in Denmark looks like slow dances when I went to class 8a. <br /> </ p> <p> - Fun 3: And you can make a catapult with a timed release explosive. But do not expect anything to deteriorate. Besides, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of the Second World War, shouting "Coming!" to destroy any remaining suspension of unbelief. Grendel was so upset and always in a snit, because as a complete CGI creation he could not leave his fingerprints. Even in the snow. - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad state because she was a single mother and the junior did not inherit her wings. There is a recessive gene. By the way, now we can make an educated idea that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. Grendel and mother chose to randomly kill, to fly or to take prey only on a close reading of the following pages of the script. - The fact that he is struck by a mythical beast that is strong enough to be thrown fifty yards against the stone, causes small facial scratches that do not bleed too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The leg sword that Beowulf used to send Hag was as long as it was tall and would contain enough steel to put a second package on the Golden Gate Bridge . Fortunately, wobbling has scattered any concern about its weight. - The best line of film: Prince Unferth has just been hit by the Hag and spit on a quarter of a six-foot blood. Princess Ingrid tied them together and said, "You will be fine, my prince." So much for that job at the triage clinic. I feel better now.
