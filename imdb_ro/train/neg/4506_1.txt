American movie makers have decided to make a film they consider Japanese. Characters, all misplaced, the actors are not really Japanese, and the set is cheap, unreal and certainly not Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Whoever reads the book understands that scriptwriters have added no added value to differentiate the movie of the scenario. Worse, they even changed the original plot line by a few bullets. Rob Marshall uses two well-known Chinese actors for the two main characters who joined earlier in the hidden dragon of the hidden tiger. Marshall has probably seen a Chinese film that represents Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again makes the movies even more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than that of this movie.
