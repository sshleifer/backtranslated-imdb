I bought this (it was just $ 3, ok?) Under the title "The gray matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As the other commentators have warned, it is a rather boring story about a top-secret government experiment that has become bad. And yes, there is a lot of fire setting, especially a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the characters and interiors are so indescribable, I think filmmakers have been worried that we might forget who is who, so they keep us cuddled, first showing the exterior of the buildings. Actually it's kind of funny. After a while, the shooting with the pool feels like a TV station identification badge, reminds us that we look at the "gray matter". I also enjoyed two appointment crises. At some point, an angry test subject confuses someone responsible, calling him a "Scientific b! Tch!". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later a different topic allows you to stop, mumping about that "scientific b ** tard!". It seemed very weird. <br /> <br /> Someday this movie will disappear forever. Another decade now will probably be impossible to find copies of it. Almost never happened. <br /> <br />
