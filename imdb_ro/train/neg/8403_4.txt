I gave it four simply from its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it appeared from blue to Showtime in the early nineties. Moe is the right man, and Larry and Curly act like a duo. Spade Cooley has some numbers. I think it had something to do with working on a farm. I'm not sure enough, because the intrigue was so minimal nothing really missing in my memory. I vaguely remember that it is a Western musical comedy. Even the Stooge seems to be moving. Generally, there is nothing to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan then you do not mind. If you are a Stooge fan, then stick with your shorts.
