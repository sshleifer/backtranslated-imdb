It sounded like an interesting movie in the blurb. Nazis, occult and governmental conspiracies. I was expecting a low-cost Nazi version of DaVinci or Boys in Brazil or even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something quite different, more psychological, something more than David Lynch. It was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is just terrible. Part of the trouble is pouring. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts off from the movement, somewhat shy and afraid. She just does not do that well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor interpreted as a son seems to have been a comedy. Most of the other actors seemed to think it was a movie or at least acted like that, rather than just being weird. The only one I thought was that daughter was very good, Siri Baruc. Another big part is rhythm. Start very slowly. So slowly you would be tempted to stop it. But then it becomes constrained for a while when you arrive at the daughter's suicide. But shortly thereafter everything becomes miserable misery. Some of these were intentional, but much of it was just futile, monotonous and ill-focused. The real problem is simply not a nice movie to watch. It is slow, boring, none of the characters is pleasant. Overstraining images and sets. Some movies that you see the characters are tortured. In this sense, the viewer does this. He has some creepy moments, especially the creepy Nazi paintings and credits, but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiring.
