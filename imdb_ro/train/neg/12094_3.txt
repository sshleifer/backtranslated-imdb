This film is supposed to be a perversion character study. Some commentators have been supposed that, because the perversion is described, the film is deeply psychological; in fact, considering salacious material, it is surprisingly boring and superficial, without motivational substance. Why is the main character the way it is? You will not find out from the script. For better treatment of the same theme (and a more fun movie), try Belle de Jour from Bunuel.
