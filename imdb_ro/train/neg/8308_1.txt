Entertainment Tonight, in the past few years, the hill descends, but from last night (August 17, 2006) it has reached a new low. In an effort to try to improve their broadcast, they decided to post real pictures of JonBenet Ramsey's body in teasers last night ... saying "Pictures from the case you've never seen before." The two pictures were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of the face and the head / neck, and you could clearly see the thread used to squeeze around his neck and crush his face. It was so terrible, I could not believe it. How did this have to do with Nothing related to Hollywood fun? Nothing!! They have dropped their dignity and values ​​to a low level ... and they look. That was the premiere to watch ... and now it's just garbage. I'm going to watch Hollywood from now on.
