Yes, in the 1980s, a moment of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck, and a series of other action stars hiding in a distant jungle that threw treasures in the air. At that moment, I could not believe movies such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION, and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget about the ridiculous RED DAWN?) They made money at the box office, they are turgid, and they did very bad. TROMA'S war is a language in the cheek that takes these types of movies, but you have to ask yourself if they need spoofing first? Of course not . TROMA's war has no sophistication - though it shows that there is no real difference between the right and the left-wing tyrants - and sometimes it feels more like a z-movie than a reference. Maybe it is ?
