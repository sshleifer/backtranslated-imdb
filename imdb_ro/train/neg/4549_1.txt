Amateurism best describes cinematic adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "Prophecy of Celestine," which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher who does not work in a mysterious village in Peru. The acting actors for home actors present the so-called characters who take excessive exposure and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by Armand Mastroianni's extremely cumbersome direction. Even if there are visible attempts to measure even fans interested in a stronger fare in the vanity of ABC's "Lost" movie or Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code", directors are no longer in charge of this task. This film revives the unbearable spiritual propaganda of mass consumption, and the results are so terrifying that few can go through this mess to identify a real point.
