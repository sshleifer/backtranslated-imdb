Nothing positive to say. Thinking nonsense, huffing and puffing with a "message". The new Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (The cuckoo comes to mind), but many have cardboard bouquet and asbestos (Nochnoi Supervisor would be a good example). This is a kind of "vacuum" of emptiness. The act would be horrible if not for the saving grace of a highly unattractive direction and an incompetent editing, sometimes so terrifying that it distracts attention from the impotence of the actors. Special prize awarded to the cameraman to make sure each shot is unclear (someone please realize that Blair Witch had 15 seconds of fabulous fame?) And headed for attention-deficient teenagers who fall under the influence of CounterStrike and masturbation. Feminine conduct looks and tries to look seductive too often, male antihero needs a dictionar coach (though genetics is not bad: rather expressive eyes). A finger (middle) for this irrelevant pile of non-art art. Anyone who feels this positive is the cousin of the "auteurs".
