I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was, though, based on the description of the catalog, I was delighted to see it. It is supposed to be a "mockumentary" of two high school students who made a documentary about high school life, showing a bad acting, a bad direction, a total lack of attractive, written characters, and everything is a total bust. I like good movies about high school and this is not one of them. Characters are one-dimensional and "self-conscious" although they are supposed to be misleading. You have the overall impression of a crowd of people sitting around to make a movie about-intentionally-evil to show their friends, but in a way arrived in Sundance. Mystifying.
