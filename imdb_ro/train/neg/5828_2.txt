I could not agree with another commentator who mentioned Jodorowsky. Barney seems to be totally boring and uninspired "in content." He can produce eye candy (and I like candies), but his claim and his fundamental artistic image just diminish all the joy. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar works by Jodorowsky or even more film makers like Tarkovsky or Kubrick (Love 2001 Odyssey and he was never bored by ending scenes ...). This type of art, as M. Barney does, adds confusion and reveals to spectators who might otherwise begin to appreciate the experimental cinema. Typical postmodern "conceptual" art. And check his interviews. I just do not buy it, I'm sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I have never been bored to see Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a total disappointment. Especially while offering the possibilities of being something, to say something in a non-linear way (such as the beginning and the choreographic dance and the preparations for the ship's exit.) Meeting the "ship" on the sea ... Ideas of faeces like an object of value (if there were stools), those "pearl" divers ... Everything could build a great surrealist film with some content but it did not do those horrible pretentious scenes of clothing and fake ceremony tea ... How vain and false and pretentious philosophical, but naked, can I get it? I have some scenic scenes, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and completely empty and fake that it made me physically ill. And it does not have a good rhythm, I like movies at slow pace, but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and false - so I was just forced to be a prolonged witness of scenes of artistic vanity ... This movie type just kills art and spirits in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
