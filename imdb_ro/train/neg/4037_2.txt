I have no idea what the Shield producers tried but the result speaks for itself: The shield is virtually undetectable. Perhaps the performances on The Shield are great ... <br /> <br /> In reality, the show is so bad together that you can not even see the shows. For example, editing is removed from the reaction photos before they have a full impact. I do not know what intellectual reason exists for that, but it breaks the spectacle of all the emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I give Shield an ambition point in his subject, but that's all I can give him. It's a shame to see a number of talented performers lose their gift on something so strangely filmed.
