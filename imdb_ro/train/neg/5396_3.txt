I read the comments that you should not watch this movie if you are looking for a shakespearian dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the agitated dialogue, this wonderful piece contains, was cut and replaced with songs. I read this piece and recently was fortunate enough to see that it was interpreted, staying one of my favorite Shakespearian comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like. The princess, though she undoubtedly did what she was about to do, had no royal role, and all the girls seemed to lose the intelligence of their characters - affected by incomprehensible cuts that not only had eliminated the female characters, comments from the context - it was a bit disturbing to hear the princess proclaim; "We are wise girls to mock our lovers!" When the mockery did not take place at all. The film's news devastated the flow and brought out many excellent scenes because they showed information in the scenes after them and were in the modern phrase. In conclusion, a great piece, ruined by a strange concept and a misunderstood cut. Kenneth, I usually like what you're doing. What were you thinking of?
