Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually an excellent film, this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" slowly ends the exotic Sergio Martino trilogy made in the late seventies (including "Isola degli uomini pesce "and not so good" La Montagna del dio cannibale "). Scouting the "Jaws" plot, the script fails to create suspense what has ever been. The creature is ridiculous, and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's sounds illustrate the adventures of these foolish tourists, presented from the beginning as obvious elements of the reptile table. Without emotion, rather laughs! And we could find this funny movement quite amusing if dialogues and the emergence of local people were not so clearly inspired by pure racism. Very soon, the chicot stops in favor of a sour feeling that confesses such a patronizing attitude. We could apologize for the bad and poor films, but not a kind of mentality. Not!
