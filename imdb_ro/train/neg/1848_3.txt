There are bad movies, then movies are so bad that they become almost art. This is one of these movies. My partner and I are at the same time so shocked, you know, looking in space and saliva! You can say that the people involved (I hope they changed their name to protect themselves) had an explosion and certainly were not shy. I give him one in three out of ten just because of the free smell and the real harm of the bad. I laughed loudly in most movies, so I think you could say he showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the above words can not in any way interpret that it is a good movie, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass a movie with such a GREAT title!
