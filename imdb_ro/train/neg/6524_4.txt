The Angry Red Planet ("Quickie Review") Like the "Man on Planet X," this is a bizarre science fiction storytelling from an era in which fantasy and science fiction were still cursed near the same thing. It means we have some very ridiculous special effects and an aggressive pseudo-science that behaves like science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" released in a high-quality transfer with a clear picture and sharp sound - by Midnite movies. So the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the time our space crew is on Mars. (What did you think the "angry red planet" referred to as Neptune?) Before that, there is a rather poor quality space crew embarking on a space ship inside which smokes and throws around the chauvinist sexist banter , the crew. It would be somewhat offensive to today's standards if it were not so fun. But Mars is the real reason we look at this. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars screaming bloody red. The film is filmed in this bright red bizarre plastic, giving the angry red planet an interesting look of overexposed redness. It is really a vision, as are the spectators of the aliens (ha ha). The best being "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think it's a joke? That's what they say in the movie! It's a giant chimera (little puppet) of a thing that combines rat, bat, spider and crab traits. She bridges all the dolls and scares those in our heroic crew. There are other strange and little imagined aliens, but the cake is also taken. Eventually, after their gross experience on Mars, the sexual crew places their "ship" and returns to any planet they have come from. It's not for everyone. Science-fiction film stories and curiosity seekers, as well as film directors. The fans at Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have a field day with it (if they have never managed to show). 2/10 Moderate score, 6/10 Score Nostalgia, 4/10 general. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
