When I was in high school, some of us boys would have occasionally stopped stinkbombs. It was considered amusing then. But the producers, directors and distributors of "Semana Santa" ("Angel of Death" in the DVD section of your video rental house) are adults, and they still do it. Like the previous commentator who wondered if the cast was eager to get off the stage and at home, I doubt that more than one moment was made for any of the scenes. Mira Sorvino, hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top-filmed, seems to have been involved in this project. Her acting is nonexistent, to a large extent confined to astonished eyes, which should indicate how "sensitive" it is to the situation of the most diverse victims of the film. But let me warn you - do not be the next victim! Remove the DVD if you find it on the shelf. There are not many good pictures of Mira (the only high points I can find in the film), and the supporting piece is of inferior quality, offering a mixture of bad dialogue made with shameful "Spanish" accents worth the most good high school theatrical production.
