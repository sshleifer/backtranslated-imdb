Good night, Mr. Tom starts in a wonderful village in the south of England, where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have a very good idea about this period, we hear a radio announcement of the World War II statement. Soon, a steam-dripping train brings the refugee children to London, and when the little shy William is spoiled with an eternal and unpleasant old man, Tom (who you know will come back to have a heart of gold) begins the story Our. And what kind of sentimental load it is. In fact, it's just the old couple-torque formula. Did not I write some new stories? As I have suggested, there is almost no time in the village and not much more in London than the old strange ambulance that shakes around. And certainly no sign of the horror of the Blitz, which the London citizens politely sent to air raid shelters. Even when the local wife of teachers is declared deprived of the alleged murder, he is later reinstated. I found "Goodnight, Mr. Tom," and the obvious emphasis and emphasis of John Thaw combined a picture of Ronnie Barker, the two Ronni, with a straw in her mouth making her accent "country bumpkin." Incidentally, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I disliked and looking at my colleagues-imdb ​​seems to me to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
