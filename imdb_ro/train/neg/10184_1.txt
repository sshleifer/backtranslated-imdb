For months I've heard about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute and cute as so many film directors who combine other people's creative ideas to make their own premise for a movie. The troops, Swingblade, any of the two million balls of Blair Witch come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood, then they do the right thing and should keep up, because combining plot contours is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase "The House of the Animals Meets Back in the Future"; "There is a meeting of the Lost Poet Society on Wall Street"; or "Shakespeare in Love Meets Secondary Wars"? I remember when the independent films were original and bold, they were not safe and predictable.
