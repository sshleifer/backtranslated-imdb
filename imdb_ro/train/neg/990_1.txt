Do not waste your time or money on this movie. My roommate hired her because she thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about some travelers caught in a cave). so we decided to look at the thought that it could not be that bad anyway. Was. I can not believe that the film was produced and published in reality. It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away, but you can not do it yourself. I honestly feel emotionally scarred. It has gone from being a low-budget movie where a college girl is being assaulted by a boy she meets in a porn movie. And indeed it is not a good one. I went to hate the woman's rapist to feel sorry for him. Close. On the whole, a terrible movie that was certainly rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not lose your money. And do not let the kids look at her.
