As other comments show, this movie could scare you when you are a small child. (And that's probably what's good for). However, if you are older, this film has only one thing: suck majorly - and therefore I do not refer to the act, the soundtrack, the cut or s.th. like this. They simply talk about the "plot" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS before ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more athletes than necessary (if after reading this, you really want to watch this movie), but if you graduate any school, this is just a big insult to your intelligence. When I looked at this, I was amazed most of the time, because what was happening was BEST. <br /> <br /> This includes: - UNITE training (a bad UN-association) <br /> -> we should think it's bad. is it really bad at all? if so, why is it evil? <br /> <br /> - the sign of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> it is not necessary to impose this on people, so why the hell (it is not a word game) do that ? <br /> <br /> - We invite Christ in your heart only as a lip service, because there is no one to be considered a "true Christian" in this film, saying stupid prayer. so ... tell the prayer before the kidnapping and you are saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> Thus, a rating of 1/10
