Well, this is a typical "straight to the toilet" movie. A short short story, a bunch of teenagers / young adults who get stuck in the middle of ghastly forests and are shattered by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics for this smile: <br /> <br /> Women, adolescents or young adults marooned in a frightening place, dead scenes, surviving being a young woman well built that will always show its core, but never the less bra, a creepy and crazy man who knows about the scene of kissing poverty, being sexually killer, Even for a slasher movie, it was terrible . The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, even the explicit sex scenes and nudity, was not enough to keep the male and lesbian audience interested. Watching was felt to be pursued with an ugly head congestion or a cold headache. Give the demon ... 0/10.
