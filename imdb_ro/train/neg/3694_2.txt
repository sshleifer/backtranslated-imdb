This is undoubtedly the worst film of Rajnikanth ever. The first part is held instead of a solid comedy from Goundamani, but it is progressing worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a dig to the saints of the same name (Baba) through a cornice and a single knife. In the first half of Rajni speaks of his style oneliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi-saint after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous saints he made dug at the earliest) gives special powers without any apparent reason (other than karma). That's getting interesting now, is not it? The rest of the movie makes him lose his bosses and magical powers and fight against the politicians and the associated black magic. The usual foreseeable carp with a hilarious implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked for our hero because it just happened to have a Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. The wicked boys and ordinary politicians are clich√©s, overburdened, and ultimately completely insignificant to the plot that does not go anywhere. But, despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with Baba screaming about a line during public events. It's also fun to watch others cursing about this movie. It seems AR Rehman has composed the tracks for his movie through his mobile phone. That's how important she considered it. Rajni is very popular in Japan and included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Japanese origin in this movie just for her sake. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching the Rajni movies after they've seen it. This film was probably a promotional material for Rajni entering politics, but the results of the film itself would have killed one of his political dreams. Fun if you stop your brain though.
