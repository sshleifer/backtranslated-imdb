Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight each other. This time, voyagers in the future arrive in 1992 and recruit some people to return with them in 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, saving a future Japan from destruction. But, after they have done this task, time travels are revealed to be a bunch of double crossings, whose own creature goes in the ramp and without Godzilla stopping it? Eek! Everything sounds very bad and it's probably, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks good too. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just garbage, rather than a good trash, and the film turns out to be just as boring as its predecessors. Watch out for the spielberg in the joke.
