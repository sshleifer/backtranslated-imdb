Audrey, I know you really value your Ted's memory, but I AM PRAYING to do your inherited righteousness and take his wishes into account. Dr. Seuss refused to release his characters during his life for a very good reason. We urge you to stop giving up your stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are destroyed by the powers that are from Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be blocked by these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever affect the loving warmth and innocence of his books. It's really your property to do what you want. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
