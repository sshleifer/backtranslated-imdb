I remember when the GOLD CHILD was released in 1986 was universally lit up by critics and I talk so badly that she ended more or less Eddie Murphy's brilliant career, so I think this movie has something to do for He goes down to a bad start, where Buddhist monks kneel before a child with an empty expression on his face.

Do you guys continue guessing?

Actually, this is the main problem (and the boy is a serious one) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to stage so much that sometimes it's like seeing scenes from totally different films joined together. I personally blame the director, but it should be emphasized that both the screenwriter and the producer should have equal guilt. Did anyone know before filming started what type of movie was going to be? It's fantasy, part martial arts, part party film, comedy party and it's all shit
