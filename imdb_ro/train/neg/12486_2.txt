Rich Ditzy Joan Winfield (a miserable miserable Bette Davis) is engaged to be married to the stupid egoist Allen Brice (Jack Carson is looking lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop marriage and was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney, Serios). They collapse the land in the desert and hate each other, but (sighs) begins to fall in love. This seems to be a high score from reviewers here just because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were so brilliant actors, but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why! The scenario is horrible - there is not a real laugh in the whole movie. The joke running in this case has Cagney and Davis falling first into a cactus (this is done three times!). Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated. Because both do everything they can with bad stuff. Cagney tries to do the best with his line, and Davis scrubs all the forces, but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" looks on his face throughout the movie (probably because the character's emotions change in a few seconds). Only the palette with its distinctive voice and over the top readings eats to get some smiles. But on the whole, this was boring and laughing-a real chore to stay in place. These are two stars only for Cagney and Davis's role and a beautiful cinema, but really - not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis have hated this movie in the years to come and you can see why.
