Frankly, I can not believe what's going on now for entertainment. Death and violence, sexual motivation, children threatening children, cruelty, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter in hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, and children sneaking out of the house midnight - yup, it sure sounds like a children's movie for me - NO! Add to them the dark and frightening elements - a dead woman possessing and turning her into a house and keeping her loving husband an in-prisoner for over 20 years and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for the children. PARENTS - is really what you want your children to watch - is that what you want to teach them about life ?! This movie is too scary for young children, and I'm afraid that teens today may be living some of the scenarios of this movie - why rub them on their faces? As for an adult audience - you will not find it frightening or funny - just boring, controversial and predictable. And the characters are wrong - parents without fault, ignorant policemen, dumb and annoying friends, terrifying and manipulative caregivers and lovers of beer / feminine beverages. What a wonderful material for kids - does it really sound like a movie for kids for anyone? Even computer animation and good voice work are not enough to redeem this terrible blow. Save Money, Save Your Time and Save Your Children's Minds - Go Hire Ice Age, Monsters Inc., Incredibles, Shrek, Bug's Life - Any one of them is far better than this dreadful movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - be ashamed of both of you having made such a disaster and then billed him as a child / family movie!
