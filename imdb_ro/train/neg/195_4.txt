Slow and full of inaccuracies. With regard to his flaws, this is still an interesting report of Alamo's famous and heroic siege during Texas's struggle for independence in Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This project for television also sees David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
