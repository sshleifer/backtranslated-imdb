This film is one of the most distorted portraits of history. Horribal inaccurate, this film does nothing to honor hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous workers slaughtered, that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man," as the Japanese engineer said. It is disgusting that such inexplicable horrors committed by Japanese captors are the source of a movie where even the bridge is not even close to being exactly at the current bridge. The current bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What are surviving survivors today? They hate the movie and everything she has to represent. Their friends have been hungry, tortured and killed by some cruel sadis. Those who have not died of dishonesty, hunger or illness are deeply injured by the film that makes such light from their darkened times.
