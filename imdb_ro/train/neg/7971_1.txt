I'm not sure who writes these brilliant comments for this movie, but believe me it's STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and horror movies, and this is that LAME only has a length of about 80 minutes and I think it's all I can take. The plot is terrible, even worse. And there is no development. Even David Cocteau's movies are better than that. JUNSAW RUNDEDE. I was expecting to hate the actor, who can be forgiven live on video if the plot is good. This has had no scare, very little Gore, and a really unattractive one. I followed this with three other friends, who I hope to talk to me again! remove the window. I can not believe no one could have provided a good review of this tribute.
