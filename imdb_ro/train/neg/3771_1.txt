This must be one of the worst movies of the 1990s. When my friends and I was watching this movie (being the target audience in which it was intended), we stayed and saw the first half hour, with our jaws touching the floor how bad it really was. Otherwise, everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, generally leaving or crying in their popcorn that they were actually paying money that they had lost to work to watch this poor apology for a movie . It should have looked like a great idea on paper, but in the film it seems that no one in the movie knows what's going on. Carp acts, suits. I can not understand how dreadful it is to look. Save yourself an hour and a bit of life .........
