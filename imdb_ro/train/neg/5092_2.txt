Shocking! In 1965 I saw Gagarin Jury alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, was at ease, and seemed to be a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like a mannequin with affected gestures and mimetism. They made a cartoon! Real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe in this movie! I saw this film after films like "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by a tiring screenplay, a poor production and production, and a lot of inaccuracies of the "Space Race". The film is the tedious rendering of well-known historical facts in Russia. A multitude of known facts about space projects have not been demonstrated. Some facts and details have been perverted. For example, in 1945, Korolev was not already a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was not already in the gold mine in Kolyma prison, but in the special prison office. Korolev was the designer in the prison design office and was not buried with the dead prisoners. But in the film Korolev worked as a serious excavator after 1940 (because the jailer has shoulder straps on the uniform). IMHO, the film's authors do not have deep knowledge of this part of history and can not make exciting movies.
