With the runaway success of the "Army of God", every roommate Mormon seems to now try to make a movie. In the recent "The Other Side of Heaven," this was not a bad thing at all. This movie, though not great, was pretty good. "Singles Ward", however, is not. By telling the story of a young Mormon man divorced back into the unique life, the style of writing and filming of "The Singles Ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the comedy of the 80s Ferris Bueller's Day Off. However, similarities end there. While "Ferris Bueller" was fun, original and well-acting (as stupid comedies as they are), "The Singles Ward" is completely the opposite. Try to be funny. However, 90% of gags are either flat or clich√© and jokes you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seem to be thrown to fill the time. And action, while not terrible, is at best amateur. In addition, if you are neither a Mormon nor a very familiar with Mormon's culture, you will not get anything at all. While the "Army of God" and "The Other Side of Heaven" were appealing to a wide range of viewers, both within and outside the Mormon church, this film is certainly a big joke inside, and even if you get it, not so funny.
