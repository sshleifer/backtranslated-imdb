I hired this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman on it, so they looked promising. And it was until Justin Timberlake came to the stage. He is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to ever make a movie. I mean, he's one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. There is absolutely no emotion on any of his lines. Why the hell was cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it seems to be a bad character mix in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cold, but believe me, do not you. Now, Dylan McDermott's action is very good. This is one of the few good things about this movie. He is just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. However, he has some very interesting lines. About the story, though it was a little bit obvious and exaggerated, sometimes it was good. I was expecting a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
