Usually, I try to build reasonably well-reasoned criticism of the films, but I can not believe that this has gone past the scenario. The dialogue is terrible, acting very upset, the accents are terrible, and the direction and rhythm are at best. I do not remember the last time I saw a bad movie. Joseph Fiennes, as he is, could have killed his career just as quickly from the beginning. Doctor Moreau Island was no worse than this garbage.
