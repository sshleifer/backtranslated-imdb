The Omega Code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was a bit (but a little precious) of good action, first of all by the two prophets and by Rostenberg, which appeared once and did not have lines. Otherwise, the act was decisively bad. The parcel line was rather weak and partly based on the already questionable biblical interpretation. Of course, not one of the best years.
