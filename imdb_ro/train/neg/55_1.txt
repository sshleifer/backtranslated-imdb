There are only two movies I would give 1/10 of this stinker and "The man who fell on the ground." I remember seeing the protocol at a theater in the early 80's when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including the high school student). I totally lost the "hilarious" gag of someone who was shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn should be charming, but it comes as a vapid and moron. Then, there are insulting stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie winning by the populist dribbling. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn. I could not stand to see another movie he was in until IMO was redeemed in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you do not want to make any effort in writing the script. The worst.
