I was willing to go with the original Intentions _Cruel. It went along with the plot and was true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my opinion, a remix with a mess, with the same story line and no clear character choices. I did not really care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are their characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I was not clear until I read IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title included a "2", I was expecting a sequel, but then I decided it had to be a piece of company. Everywhere, I have to say that this film has read, at least for me, a soft pornographic version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
