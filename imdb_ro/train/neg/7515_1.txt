Sucks. That's all I have to say about this excuse for a movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell were they thinking? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make other movies. The actor was so bad he did not manage to have fun at a bad level. Trying to have a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie is shit! Sucks! Suck! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about a sequel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
