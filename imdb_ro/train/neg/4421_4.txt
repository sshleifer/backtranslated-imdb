The subject is certainly convincing: a group of people give their love to play a step further, creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an exciting phenomenon that fits into our collective need to "escape" the reality and sometimes the mundanism of our existence - something almost everyone can refer to. The characters are the predictable mix of comrades Lord of the Rings and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to attract most people. However, very quickly, the film turns into an insider's vision of the war, with an almost stereotypical shift of the nose towards viewers who "do not receive it". Those who create the film seem to be subject to warfare and, in particular, waaaaay too seriously than to recognize humor and fun from time to time in making a film about adults spinning in medieval gears and hitting each other with foam swords . It's hard enough for anyone not to sit on the computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or designing the latest star destructor to understand what the characters are saying and why we should care. However, the filmmakers themselves do not seem to be careful to choose to focus exclusively on the subject of the game instead of building a strong narrative with a clear story somebody can understand. In addition, the characters themselves are not so convincing and you get bored quickly by them: a great no-no when trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
