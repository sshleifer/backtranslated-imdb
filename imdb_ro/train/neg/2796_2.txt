For the most part, On Demand offers some horrific horror movies and only offers other horror movies that everyone has already seen and already have opinions. It was either that, or Invincible (I love Mark Wahlberg's films) that I did not see, and actually I was in a movie that looked at mood, which is not often the case because I've already seen all the movies they own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I'm not really interested in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret. I will not spoil, I will tell you that only a few of the actors in this film are half-decent. I think the main girl, the dead girl who kills everyone, is very annoying but convincing; I would take her for the psychic bitch every day, so it fits well with her, though it's blades. Blood is not that big, just a few of the killings, or I can say that the "wounds" are fine, but you do not see too much and there are no props in the movie to make the lesions look more convincing. Towards the end of the movie, I asked my girlfriend to turn it off, and as a member of the band, the "recording" pieces were not very interesting, though what happened would really happen when I was going to the recording. I'm done, if you want to look at this, fit it.
