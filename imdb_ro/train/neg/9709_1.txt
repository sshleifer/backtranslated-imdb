At 30 seconds in the opening credits, we had this feeling that it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then the actor playing a bad Nazi scientist opens my mouth and my friend and I decided that in order to survive this movie we will have to turn the volume down, make our own dialogue and double the speed on DVD. But that did not help. Almost halfway I stopped it. Now, I've had some bad movies with both Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Svengoolie, but there are just a few movies that I doubt even if the Bots can save. Most of the movie that bothered me most was that people hypnotized to think they were zombies had a rotting green skin. I think all were hypnotized in death, then hypnotized in rottenness. Stay in the classical classic cult of B, such as "Planning us out of space".
