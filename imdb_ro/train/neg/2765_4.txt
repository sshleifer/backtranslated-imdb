How this movie was made with an estimated budget of $ 70 million and without being completely cut off, is beyond me. Story and dialogue are beyond amateurs. Characters say things that no real person ever would ever say and almost never react to the things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The leadership is good, since the writing is such a stupid ... but some actors who support the roles really pull the production down. The hero's hair probably had to get his own credit, it was so strange to attention ... not to mention that he gave one of the best performances in a bit. Finally, for a film about L.A. is besieged by huge reptiles, this film is boring shocking. What a shame! If you see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking about ways you could take SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it would not have taken too much.
