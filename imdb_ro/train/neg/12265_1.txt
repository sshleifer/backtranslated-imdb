The special effects of this film are, especially for its time, ridiculous and used in such a great way that you can not deny their terrible existence. The act redefines the term "terrible overacting" in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine "bad". <br /> <br /> The charm of this film can be found in two things: First, the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as the mysterious psyche of Gaunt, who can feel where and when people will die and is always there. <br /> <br /> The second is the original, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, if it's terrible, but other discoveries are more original, as if the Zack Stone gun is able to feel the pain of the men they shoot his action runs here)> <br /> Try ... you do not see this movie unless you like this ol 'hunk-a-brutal Carel Struycken, like any respected Dutch man.
