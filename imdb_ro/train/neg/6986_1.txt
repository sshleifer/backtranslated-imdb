I can not imagine Al Pacino. I see him in Godfather, Scarface, Way Carlito, and I think I look at one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. Then I see him in "Two For The Money", "Any Given Sunday and Revolution" and I wonder what the guy thinks. I beat the Revolution a few nights ago and I thought I would invest the next two hours on this. Here's a flash of news: Do you want to let the prisoners talk? Force them to look at it all over ... they will confess to anything. I will not refresh the plot because there is no coherent plot, but it takes place during the American Revolution, and Pacino plays an unruly peasant who does not want to get involved but eventually does. While he has no money, no education and does not dress like a cave man, a hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, because he has only two minutes of dialogue together. Very honestly, if "Al Smith" starred in this film, instead of "Al Pacino," they would have destroyed their career. The scenario was horrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obviously false accent have made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I really can not describe him. Natasha Kinski is a main character but has 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody talks too much about this movie. One of the most ridiculous concerns in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this strange talent to meet each other continuously on the battlefield. It's like the whole Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hey, fun to see you again, on another battlefield, 100 miles away ... I see you in a few months." I have to give this star of IMDb because there is nothing here for a negative score.
