A pretty funny piece that tries to show how smart the Orcas are, but in the meantime (and quite unobtrusive to them) makes the audience feel stupid, making the most ridiculous movie. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, it's wrong, he's playing Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches the sharks, but he's trapped and trying to catch a killer whale. When capturing a murderous female whale does not ask (do not ask), mate (do not ask) goes into a kidnapping (do not ask) and begins to guide Captain Nolan (Do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes they have something in common (do not ask). Pretty amazing movie film here. I have to tell you that the beginning (with whales noises and nothing else) is quite haunting, and the final credits (with the most bold song) are quite fun.
