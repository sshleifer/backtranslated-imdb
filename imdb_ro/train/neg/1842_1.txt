This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not, in good conscience, allow this movie to be scrutinized by me. The people must be warned! First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") I like Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet I hated this movie. There is a plot, but it takes care when there is no scenario. Dialogue is unreal and simple boring, situations are contracts, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unsatisfactory and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good premise, is bad. This movie is a piece of poo. Never waste money on this movie, it's not even worth watching your time. Please do not see him ... I beg you!
