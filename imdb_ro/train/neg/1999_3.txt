At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to record the posterity case. For good reason! The one who died left his small gray cells at home (I'm sorry for Agatha) for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no acute analysis of the signs at crime scenes. Holmes bumbles fifty yards behind the fence. The disappointed CAM is eventually treated by an old fragile - in a way that would have made Charles Bronson's heart proud to swim - six bullets in the bread basket. In a pursued pursuit, a pursuer seizes one of Watson's shoes. She does not decide to tell you about Cinderella's story of prolonging the movie. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, frees free. Well, it's a bit of a change in rhythm in late Victorian London. A bit of the sixth law :-)
