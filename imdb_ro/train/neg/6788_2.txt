The idea that in the name of the people is good, a killer does not want his only daughter to come to an institution and asks the parents of the girl he murdered to take care of his daughter. And you can expect from the actors, especially from Scott Bakula, to do a good action, unfortunately not! People's name turns out to be regular on Friday night tearjerker. Flashbacks with a girl who was killed are pretty pathetic and you can just predict what actors will say at a certain stage ... If you want to watch a good movie about this topic, watch Dean Man Walking!
