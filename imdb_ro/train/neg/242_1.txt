From a poorly executed plot that has almost no sense to the bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the highest level, bad action (even Peter Falk does not find its way) "Finding John Christmas" is better lost. Mrs. Bertinelli's performance has no depth or emotion, as are her co-stars, William Russ, brother Hank and David Cubitt, who love Noah's interest. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, daughter Noah's single father, it's almost unbearable to watch you stop singing. But who can blame them with materials like this. Michael J. Murray's screenplay is at best juvenile. <br /> <br /> Every year, at this moment, I'm looking for TV guides and I'm worried that some truly classic and inspirational Christmas movies will appear on the small screen. Movies like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful "Corner Shop" and, of course, Scrooge's 1951 version. There is Frank Capra's classic "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Meet John Doe." Hey, here's the classic. How about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great interpretation of Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My present for you is through advice. Your time would be better spent looking for these movies than finding "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
