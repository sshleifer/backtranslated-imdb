Granted, this seems to be a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a comedy by Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and find out. In fact, Martin, the leader, is misdirected. He does not make the awesome paper he knows from films like "The Jerk," but instead plays a kind of character between them that does not work. Hawn, without anyone to play, is terrible. Cleese is the only member, even partially funny. In addition, the plot is bad enough. I can not tell how much it could have changed, but the characters seem to have the slightest value of common sense. They guess through New York, doing nothing right, and unfortunately nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very luminous, a repeat theme throughout the film. to see this, go again the original "Weird Couple" rent again.
