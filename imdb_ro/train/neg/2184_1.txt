This movie is a free collection of incomprehensible analogs and evil plotting devices designed. Film History: The director of this film was a perverse who ran around the city filming random women. When his wife discovered the movie, he was forced to straighten his story quickly. He claimed to make a movie called "The Brain That Would not Die". Finally, his wife asked to show him "the so-called movie." That night, he quickly shot some scenes with a friend and "The Brain That Would not Die" was born. I hate this movie! Plot Synopsis: The fiancÃ© of the main character is killed in a horrible car accident (caused by ignoring the clearly displayed road signs). He draws his head from the wreckage and reanimates him. After reanimating his head, he goes and raises a bunch of prostitutes. That's about what's going on for the rest of the movie. At the end, he struggles and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and I assume that they live happily ever after. The on-screen notes: The final screen of credit claims that the movie is called "The Head That Would not Die". /> <br /> I hate this movie!
