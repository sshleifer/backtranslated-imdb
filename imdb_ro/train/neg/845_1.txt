It's a shame you can not vote for stars on IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! Actually, I would go so far as to say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie thinking that because he had Michael Madsen in it, he might be fine ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine a length of movie "The Bold and the Beautiful", okay, Primal Instinct has not even come close to this, and I've previously thought there's nothing worse than the length of "The Bold and the Beautiful" . <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do that? The worst part is that I did not come back too soon, hoping to finally reveal it was a kind of sick joke, that they thought it would be fun to make us watch such a bad movie /> <br /> Where do I start ...? Director - Zero Stars, Scenario - Zero Stars, Actors - Zero Series, Cinema - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Makeup - Zero Stars, half-star, a DVD menu - half a star. However, I think it is very important to have seen bad movies just to know what the very bad movie is, for this reason, I am happy that I saw this movie just to have a bad movie to put in the side bottom of my list.
