I'm proud to say that I've seen all three fast and angry movies. Sure, the parcels are a little foolish and it might be a bit of cheese, but I liked car searching, all the beautiful cars and the midnight races. And I'm glad to see a fourth. I want to know what difference is going on between the three and Redline? Some decent actors, somewhat thoughtful, even if they are guessed and, last but not least, directors who have an idea. All three have been made by highly competent executives, all have taken the films in another direction, just as exciting. The dress seems to have chosen the dozen women she slept on the casting couch and made them, and then took her lead from the Hollywood unemployment line. And script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.This is 70 made for bad TV movie. Yes, the movie had some cool cars, but you can not see that many in action and the action is so stupid that you can not sing enthusiastically about tracking, if the cars do not make you thrilling, why go to a movie like this? I'm in public with a bunch of adolescents, and I can not change my mind aloud. this was just a disaster. Rent F & F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go to a karting track and race yourself. Whatever you do, avoid Redline as bad cheese.
