I have not seen anything so bad since I left James Bond's "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to stay entirely because of Tilda Swinton, but she could not do anything to save this beast. As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Throne", this film has failed in all aspects of the films. The characters were of cardboard and could not evoke any sympathy. The land was completely unbelievable. The act was, except for Swinton, amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in the "Throne". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I can go on, but what is the purpose. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber has consented to appear in such a stupid, but she most likely regrets now. Do not waste your money or time on this stinker. There is nothing to be seen here.
