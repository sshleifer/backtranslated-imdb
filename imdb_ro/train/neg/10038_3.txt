The movie has no style, I mean the original style. everything seems to be copied, including action, first appearances in the film, songs, diffusion of dialogue, etc. Yes, there were original, as in the beginning, a car is displayed with the number UP **** and a few seconds later it starts to fall on a hill with MH number ****. That was one of the many goblins of the movie :) Another good thing in the movie? yes, for karen fans, if any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogues and moments of action. That's it. Nothing else. So, watch at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. Director is already crazy and actors, I pity them.
