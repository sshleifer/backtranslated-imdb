Maybe I'm not a critic, but here's what I think about this movie. Well, I watched the film on cinema and first of all I have to say how much I like the story I want to say that a snowman will come with scared little children, secondly it's pretty upsetting, but I bet that the movie has a budget so low probably used ketchup, so my critical vote is BOMB !!! try it well and continue sucking twice more.
