"Flight Of Fury" is a strange action movie, but the worst of the boring action - I do not expect much of a Seagal movie, all I expect is to have fun for 90 minutes with a mindless action - (the action scenes are very few and far away), the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is complicated and confusing with whole plot holes, the action is truly abisal - bordering on the shame of Seagal and his whispering A show the expression of being the best of the mischievous crowd of the third loser, it seems hard to believe that something close to $ 12 million was spent on this mess if 11 million of the 12 were Seagal's salary - I doubt somehow! The only moment of interest for Straight men or homosexual girls is that, apparently nowhere, two hot chicks end up in a sex scene of lesbians of a complete kind, with huge balls on the display, otherwise than that - There are mediocre things that do not differs from many of Michael Dudikoff's B-Movies I have endured 1/10
