I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes began to "take over" the plane. At first I thought she should get a "one" to release the comic. But then I realized that I can watch the three stoogi for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Any respect we would have for Samuel Jackson was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood once again demonstrates how far removed from reality they really are. When I was a kid, we used to get snakes for fun. The only thing the snakes will do is to crawl at the bottom of the cargo port. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. This movie does not deserve a trip to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. If you want to be very scared, I suggest your descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. The worst performer will be a million times better than this garbage.
