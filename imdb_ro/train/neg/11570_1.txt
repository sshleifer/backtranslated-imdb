the intention that directors have for these films is quite honorable, but the history of her productions made me aware that this could not get too much to the core, as other filmmakers would do. keeping in mind the 30-day television series, but also counting MTV's "Pun bet you will", which opposes its gravity in any of the issues it documents and also counting its production rather disappointing "supersize" hopes to grow. Unfortunately, this film disappointed me. as with "overwhelming me" after a while, I wondered exactly what of all this was. the main statement becomes quite clear after half an hour, but the rest of the game time is filled with things quite useless and repeating things that have already been presented in this way or another earlier in the film, so it exhausts and becomes extremely boring to the end.
