Anyone who loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed with this film. All magic and romance have been upgraded from her original story about a girl doing a good deed for a mysterious young lady and giving her "three" instead. Three what? Not three wishes, but three trips in the 1800s on a shit elevator ... The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is All in a timely manner.
