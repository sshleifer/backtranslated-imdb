Having in-Laws over the weekend? Then, this is the movie to hurry their departure, in the absence that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcoming relief from constant nagging. The film is supposed to have set aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated rail cars; the intrigue has more holes than the average hole and a piece trained from the depths of the D celebrity list. An interesting piece of fun is the "Spot the Villain" game, while the passengers join the ship. You will not be wrong !! With a scenario that sinks faster than a brick, the clichÃ© has put pieces and abundant amounts of raspberry jam doubled as blood, this film tries to include the genres of thriller, action film and gore-fest and never manages to do any of them . > <br /> You have to watch the movie if you laugh just how bad it is.
