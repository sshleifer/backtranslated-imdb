This film is the culmination of everything that is bad in the modern movie. unnecessary slow motion, useless flipping / jumping / somersaults, unnecessary characters, useless dialogue .... basically futility. (is it a word? Well, it was just invented by me, Robot.) What happened to the practice? (the garage of the car, the skin spray), the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the sharing of cards at the confectionery. What happened to the attitude towards women? (that is, Smith's character only degrades the doctor for the best part of the film, yet he "wishes.") Where is the tension? I will tell you where, looks good, not admiration or common ground) /> <br /> What happened to a detective who detects? Smith did nothing but stand around and hurt himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that aroused a thought that he was gone. this is a kind of blades to get the story from the point b-c-d etc. ... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking several times in a row, which was "Sanctify and do not listen to your joke? Twice in a scene?") What happened to the small parts of a movie being somewhat significant and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (baby) is in the film for a total of two SCENES, we know that A-degrades women and B-knows Smith ....... from CURS we have to care about him and whether or not he comes wound What happened to Hero? Let's forget that there are people, women and children everywhere attacked by robots and selfishly saved the only person who realized I had a knowledge and why he had to lift his bike through the air, showing himself while the doctor somehow managed to reach the same distance in just a few seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I'm still for the show, but I'm still for realism and sense. <br /> <br /> I have to say I never laughed so hard on a movie and in a long time. so thank you Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the swing of social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler and simpler stories anything else in movies ...... but especially simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Films: "So You Have to Die"
