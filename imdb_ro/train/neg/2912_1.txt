"Meatball Machine" must be one of the most terrible, terrible and horror films horror films I've ever met. It's about good against evil and a story of age, in order to have fun with a bloody, humorous and humorous context. For this reason, violence is not particularly terrible and does not make you face, but free blood and nudity are free. The performances of Isaiah Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst thing I've seen, if not enough, is directed by a director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has everything, it's bad for the bone, you have to see for every b-movie weird! ... Simply: a jewel of laughter and rare.
