Fatal commands - apart from assigning plot - means that the character does not resonate or even does not react. Two examples: A priest who passes through the late cemetery at night is suddenly attacked by ghost spirits. After he fought, he resumed his walk when his buddy came. "Something wrong?" His friend asks after seeing the attack. "Only demonic spirits - nothing I could not deal with." No reaction, no surprise, as if he had changed a tire. His friend is just as fearless ... it must be a standard preparation of the priests ... ["And then you put a cotton ball in your mouth ... Any question ... Okay, go ahead, the Demon Spirit attacks. .]] Second Example: At one point, priests need to answer a question, and only a demon (or something that cared for them so far) might offer it. How? Why, you have to ask a dying man! So the demon has a random person hanging in front of the two priests, so that they can ask their question to the man who casts a glance at his throat. "Hey, do not kill him!" or maybe "It's not beautiful!" would have been more realistic than their response. They never ask for letting man go or stop - in fact, the closest to the reaction I receive is a slight despair. They ask their question and go. I had to close it at that moment - my brain began to atrophy. Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
