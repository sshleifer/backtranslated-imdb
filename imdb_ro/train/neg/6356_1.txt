If I overturned this script in a textual form, I would read it and maybe laugh. But I would not laugh at the points in the movie where the director seems to want to laugh. Although I am not yet completely certain. I do not care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can not write a dialogue or at least he can not write the dialogue consciously, then play shows from actors able to draw laughter even from the best clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrased) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking to get a job in an art gallery." OK, so it says, but honestly, do you know of any art history that would say that? How do you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really an art gallery that would have believed it?" The entire scenario is full of a kind of quasi-intellectualism that I would not have expected from a respected writer. I admit that I do not know Allen's other work and, judging by that, I do not want to start learning. Characters are wrong without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from human condition? Or really writing really poor? You are the judge.
