I went to see this movie at the cinemas and I was shocked when I walked into the room. It was just me and my girlfriend! This has cried out to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> No, to my surprise, the movie was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narrative in which she falls in love with the girl who hates him. His actor is OKish, but for the comedic aspect of the film he is not very good. The plot line is weak and the comedy almost nonexistent. However, there are some good points. For example, the family breaks apart and the mother is very funny. I hope this review stops other people who lose their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room!
