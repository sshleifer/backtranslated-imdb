Somehow they sum up the 1960s, ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what a four-hour pain it was. They have trivialized major events and events and have "pretended" that it was about two families, but you have just seen the African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and ashamed to broadcast them. What was fun was that the lucky, lucky family you saw from the beginning was tortured in many ways but managed to attend every major 60-year event in the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They may have devoted perhaps five or six total scenes to this family. That poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make any movie about other times ... leave the PBS and the History Channel
