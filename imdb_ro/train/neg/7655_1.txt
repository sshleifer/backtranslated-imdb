We all have to congratulate Uwe Boll. He made it unthinkable. He may be the only director who has two 100-foot movies on IMDb! It's like a kind of cinematic beetle. Regardless of the talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to do them. I know, he finances them all by some kind of bizarre German background, but even so, his ability to continue making movies despite absolute and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. it would not be so bad, except that video game developers continue to offer the best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark game series. Even the most recent, The New Nightmare, was good for several hours of play. There was a good movie in the adventures of Edward Carnby, but that's not. Now, Uwe Boll has taken Bloodrayne and Hunter: Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the wind that this guy will cut through the game-to-film adaptation if he does not stop. Someone has to take their credit line or these video game publishers have to understand and realize that when I make a bad movie from a game that kills the franchise, nobody is interested in the title. > <br /> Think, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and no one cares. The title is dead, and that's because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you are working for a game publisher or if you know a game publisher or if you have access to a game publisher ... please alert them. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is not worth revising. I can not separate what I did not like about this pile of manure from the rest. Literally, everything about this is gloomy. Writing, driving, music, CG effects, editing. I thought if I waited until it appeared on DVD and then hired it with poor expectations, I would not be disappointed. Well, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to take out a large bunch of BOLL steam.
