* Warning Spoiler * First we rated this movie 2 out of 10. The idea is good, but there are too many bad errors in the movie, it makes a psychological drama that it could have been. First of all, she never struggles alone. After a very strange initial strange doubt from her mother (which is not credible when the mother proves to be so sustained and loving later in the film), the victim of rape is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is also incredibly naive always falling into the strange crew traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly ugly. The thing I find most unbelievable is that Ethan fails to control the crew when they change their minds. Ethan is very much the crew leader (hey, they really say that) and people seem to think the other guy is a bastard, but when Ethan changes his mind, he can not convince even one crew member he's right and that his former friend is wrong. Everyone just hates it ... why? The film does not provide any explanation. How has the leader ever become? A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when he came in. Two actors from the same series of successful television ... a cheap way to get viewers?
