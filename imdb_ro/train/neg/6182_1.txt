This film makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood's costume instead of a human boy in a probably-not-Robin-Hood costume and ignores all the personal features in it that really matter. This movie makes Wendy an idiot idiot. And the poor captain finds a TOTAL clown. And of course, every Disney cartoon has to have a character that has had too many blows in the head, made one of the lost one. The only character that was not disgusted in this movie is Tink. The only star is for her. Was that the story then? Darling Fathers do not even have time to notice that their children have gone! Perhaps one of the most significant points in the original story and destroyed it! Also, the famous Nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is an amazing piece of - There are no fingers and acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one. It is a miracle that he lost his shadow and helped him to keep it. (Even on his shoes and it does not make any sense to me.) Ruining a wonderful story like this just to amuse children should be illegal. So you know now if you did not know it before - this Disney version has nothing significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story but just a wonderful and wonderful story. <br /> <br /> That does not bother me at all.
