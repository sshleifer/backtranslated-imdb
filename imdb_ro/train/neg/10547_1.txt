I do not remember a movie where I care less about where the characters come from, what happens to them or where they are heading. I realize that Hollywood's greatest fun is umbilical watching, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to waste their time. But what is worth, the discussion that followed, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, took into account the fact that the three women showed some redeeming characteristics. I disagree.
