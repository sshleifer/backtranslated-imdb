"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King wrote a script. In view of this, and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie, you would expect a strange and eventually satisfying visual experience. Unfortunately, that's not what you get. The thing is, he could have done a good movie. The beginning is intriguing with the scary atmosphere of the small town. But strange things happen for about 20 minutes in the movie. The movie becomes funny without an obvious reason! From that moment on, the whole Sleepwalkers atmosphere is ruined. For those of you who have seen it, who can ever forget good old Johnny by shouting "COP KABOB !!" after he punched the pencil in the ear of a cop? But do not misunderstand me, humor has no quality of redemption. I just rented it again to see if mabye got the first mistake around, considering how original the plot went into, but I was right. Dude, what a loss. I can not believe they were entitled to that Santo & Johnny song. I gave a 2.
