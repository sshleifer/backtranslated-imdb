Well ... I was going to wait until it came out on the video to see it, and I wish I actually had I caught the scary film 2 on cable the other day, and it made me to scream for more of the same thing, it was AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles then you'll probably be in heaven, but if you get used to WAYANS COMEDY, then you'll be disappointed, it was much more eye candy in this, which will keep young young hormones young happy teenage boys happy, which is probably why a box office hit the first week went out. I liked the scary film ten times more than this feed, and a 5 times more. Strange that better than 3 is part 2 but then again I always enjoyed Halloween 2 better than the original as well .. it can be just me. The funniest part of the film must be the way aliens say "Goodbye". But that's not worth the $ 11 I spent with my fianc√©. Save your money and pin back the 2nd part on the cable until it's released on video tape, then rent it, do not buy it.
