I'm a big fan of the Largo Winch TV series. This movie was pain for me. I had to use it quickly before I did not fall asleep. It was boring! How can anyone destroy this title so much? The story was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. I can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is null. Watch the other roles of this actor. The battle scenes were boring unbelievable and could not be traced, in a way they did not have to follow the situation. Like other commentators, he said low-budget film with bad actors. Perhaps next time someone else can do better out of this title. French can not do good with big movies, such as Alien 4. That was a little bit, after Alien 1,2,3.
