SEX WISH was released over the course of time (minus ten minutes more than a minute) in the UK during the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a cup of tea when it was supposed that he inspired a copied murder case. Strangely enough, the newspapers brushed this extremely disturbing blow under the carpet in their haste to get the relatively innocuous frozen cans of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, and the film was also forgotten. I jumped to the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with a jaw on the floor. Is not that politically incorrect, like dementia, a triple-X takes Michael Winner's Death Wishing (did the title give the game away from inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really ugly violence in - already blooming for seventy years. If you do not consider yourself squeamish, this can force you to think again. Until SEX WISH ends, you will want to clean your lips with clean disinfectant and make a long hot shower to clean you. If a movie really deserves "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie" tag-line, it's it. <br /> <br /> Highlights - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim while masturbating over it, Harry Reems's mustache steals, the helpless black young man who is forced to mislead the sword killer ( would have won the Oscar for their credible performances if the Academy were angry) before man is castrated for his troubles and for a frightening direction that threatens to lift the action above the original origin of the beam. Do not say I did not warn you. If you think the world is a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove very, very wrong.
