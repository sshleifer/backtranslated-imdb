I just saw DreamGirls yesterday and I was really underwritten. Despite all of the Oscar's lips, there is nothing special. Anyone really impressed with this movie has never bothered to see any of the true classics of film music. With the exception of Eddie Murphy's musical and dramatic show, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie without style or flair. Just a bunch of amateurs singing each other! Now the first half hour was good, but I was irritated by the way Eddie Murphy's extraordinary performances were truncated and interrupted by fittings. These were easily the best songs and best performances in the movie. And the "top-up" portion of the movie was the only part of the movie that had a consistent view or any moment. The remaining clock and 45 minutes were a formidable, angry misery that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough interesting. It was also boring visually and included too many sound-like songs. Condon did not try to turn any of the songs into big showpieces, as I would have expected. Each number in the second half was just one detail after another by "singing" each other. And the way they hit Hudson's big number, "love me," was a killer! Condon just shot her around the stage - no drama! God was sucked! And note to all those involved - that the "dialogue thing" can work on the scene, but it does not work in movies (see the embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom). All this "I'm going to look at something you do!" the carp should have been left on the editing floor. These are not "songs". Again, the movie - except Eddie Murphy's stunning performance - was nothing but a glorified TV movie. Must be a megabuck behind the PR work for this movie! I wonder how much money I spent to give that pre-release "beat Oscar" buzz? On the whole, this film was, except for Eddie, THAT next to an Oscar-like film! (except for Eddie) I would class it up there with Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all (very expense I have) hype!
