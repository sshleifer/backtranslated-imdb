This sequel is completely uneven, incoherent and embedded in the "plot" (if there really is one) and trying too hard to be modern (ridiculous, outside the period and characters of the 21st century style) and cute (yawning: too many jokes made, mocked with animals.) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) escapes through this movie, parodying the original De Ville and lead on Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that's not even good to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and useless sequel. Even the Basic Instinct 2 had a plot, an acceptable characterization and action. This does not. It's bad.
