I think it could have been a decent film and some parts are OK ... but it's a B movie. The same goes for the plot, the pieces are fine, but there are more holes and strangles that do not add. The action is mostly good, I have even worse about it. :) <br /> <br /> The top sets the level with machines driving in the desert, making "cool", but unnecessarily jumping through some small dunes (slow moving! Cool!), as if the drivers had not seen never sand before ... There's something better out there, but not too much. If you rent it, take another and use it as a heating. Keep your expectations low and it may work for you.
