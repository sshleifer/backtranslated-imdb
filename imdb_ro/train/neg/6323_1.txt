This movie is a bad memory from childhood. This is one of those movies that children showed on a rainy day at school when you can not go out on vacation and you prefer to see something, something else. At least it was when I was in primary school. I remember doing this movie. They've been given, I've never seen it for 15 years, and probably do not use it in rainy days, but I just want to warn them all: you'd better use this to get your kids to sleep rather than have fun. Believe me, choose something else. Even if the subject is somewhat controversial, the plot is so tedious and slow that I do not remember anything about it, except I did not plan it so hard that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against him.
