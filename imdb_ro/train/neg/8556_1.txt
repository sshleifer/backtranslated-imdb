OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm aged in demographic and identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes sticky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different film it would have been forgiven. I try as much as possible not to destroy this film like others, but it's not so easy when movie makers have not tried at all. Editing in this movie is terrible! Perhaps the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you do not have to go to film school to learn, good editing slant is not one of them, but identifying a bad is. Also shot ... Oh my god blows, just terrible! I can not even go into detail, but sometimes we see random things that appear and this, along with editing, will give you the most painful movie experience. This movie was made on low or no budget, with 4 cast and crew not an excuse as well. I've seen short movies on YouTube with much more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the hell you thought, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of ego. You should be ashamed of yourself! In conclusion, this film is akin to what would be a truly lazy amateur pornographic film if it had been filled with 3 or 4 odd sex scenes separated by long and boring conversations and a disgusting masturbating scene. If this is not your kind of work, avoid that at all costs!
