Mann shoots the Alberta Rocky Mountains in a superb way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give good performances as they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a Mountie who tells the people of Dawson City, Yukon to choose a marshal (give a marshal!) and apply the law itself, then the guns fighting the streets to control the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing resembles even the distance that happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike expulsion. Mister. Mann and the company seem to be confused with Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West. Canadian theaters are ready for a kind of Reefer Madness of pleasure with this strange plot or to shake your head in disgust.
