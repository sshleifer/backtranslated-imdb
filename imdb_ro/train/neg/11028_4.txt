Nearly the beginning, when it was established that the murderer John Dillinger (Warren Oates) is an egomaniac rapist, another bandit from the 1930s is surrounded by a farm and surrounded by the FBI. Second Commander Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson) studies the situation, pulls a cigarette in his mouth, picks up two automatic machines with a 45-caliber load, and heads for the remote home. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis was leaving the house alone, wearing the female hostage, dead dead. However, a long time ago. If you're excited about stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have a considerable appeal. Oh, it's just as exciting as it is without a mind. Mrs. Floyd is meeting dramatically with his death. Multiple violations of the civic code. Enough shooting with Tommy guns and guns. Blood everywhere. <br /> <br /> In history, it moves. Few I remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, whom I would guess because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis, because he was a rival for public attention, though. The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He is the guy who wrote in the contract that if the animals were shot and killed during one of their productions, it should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy, a freak-full weasel who had Teddy Roosevelt's Ride Riders in the Spanish-American war that shouts from Henry V - "St. Crispin's Day" and all that. Interesting, yes, and the garbage completely. "I knew I would never live him, and I did not try too hard." That's it, kill them all and let God sort them. <br /> <br /> You will love.
