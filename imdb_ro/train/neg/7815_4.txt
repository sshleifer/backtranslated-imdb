As a long-time comedy fan of Superman, through the series of the '50s, the first two films by Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark and, finally, Smallville, we were * really * hoping for something smarter with "Superman Returns" <br /> Instead, we had Lex Luthor doing another real estate conversion test, another superman-beaten sequence while wearing kryptonite and internal inconsistencies: could not stop falling in the ocean when blocked by 6 "of kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3", leaving the rest embedded in it, can he lift a continent into space? Indeed, the only hero in the story was Lois' partner - I do not remember the name outside of him. He did all sorts of rescue, heroic things, with nothing but courage and understanding - without superpowers, without invulnerability ... just an ordinary man. They continue to make the Superman so small. Why can not we survive Bramaniac or struggle to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's minor schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they're doing this in Smallville. Yeah ... I think I'm gonna stay at Smallville ... Probably should ...
