Ladies Man is a funny movie. It's not too much behind her, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (Superstar or A Night at The Roxbury), Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the film). Besides, the rest of the camp is medium and it's just there to support the Meadows. I've certainly seen funny movies, but I've seen the thick ones. Again, it's not really a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was more funny than a sketch. But if you want a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just do not think too much about it, or you will hate it. Rating: 6/10
