I thought the movies needed parcels or other means to careless about story lines or anything. This movie showed me that in fact you do not have to have something like this. We could just summarize. But, IMDb wants to have several lines. She was pretty pretty. not convincing in the least. The way the characters are talking in the movie makes you think it should have happened in a matter of days, but there is no passing of time and I'm sure everything is happening in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink before throwing. It would be a much better use of your time. The time you will never come back. Jurassic Park 3 was retired better than this movie.
