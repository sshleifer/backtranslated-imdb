The cover of the DVD and the disc is extraordinary, you think they made a movie about a swirling metallic black tooth that is still a very good idea but the actors in this movie are worse than Ben's performance in the pearl port, better quality and better actors. I wanted to buy the DVD, but fortunately I first rented it, the script and the script are also horrible, nothing seems to go together, so the movie never makes sense. The weak attempts to scare you on flashback scenes are worse than those used in sitcom shows in the 80's, and eventually let you head against your home wall.
