Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever detract from the hero of the last act, but this is happening easily. The film is about 3 unique guys who meet on Sunday to discuss weekend sex escapades. A fourth guy - who is married - who was part of a group, looks and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. Banknotes are not funny but repeat throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
