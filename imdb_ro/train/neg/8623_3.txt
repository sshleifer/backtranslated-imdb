This film is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) who is trying to catch a super intelligent thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever the plans the cop is trying to do, the thief knows them beforehand. This film, full of charmed actors, glamorous actress and good photos of the Hong Kong scene, has no substance at all. Everything is flash and the flash gets boring fast. I lost all my interests a third of the way in the film, and there is no quality of redemption afterwards, except cinematography, which looks good. Only consider this movie if you can do it for free. Also consider stopping watching the film 20 minutes in the movie because it is the same as at the end of the year: MEETING. 6/10
