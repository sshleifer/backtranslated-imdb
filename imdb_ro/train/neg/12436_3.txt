The first Home Alone was a pretty decent movie ... the sequel was almost the same in a new frame. It tries to be original and succeeds to some extent ... of course, the formula is essentially the same, so it's like watching the same movie for the third time with a slightly modified plot. The new score is bad enough (although the new track "Trap Settings" was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the high score of the first and the near but not very good score in the second. She (almost) does it to use pretty good non-original music, but it's not the same. The plot is fair and somewhat original in the franchise, but at the same time it is the same film as the first two, with weaker action and a less impressive example of "scary character that turns to be good." The act is largely unimpressive. Characters are mostly caricatures. The new thieves are less distracted than the old ones (and have fun with spies, who are almost criminals, given the limited amount of good spy movies and how few of them are wonderful). The fact that there are several of them (and therefore more traps) is just a weak attempt to try to go higher than the first two movies ... and it does not work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission is too loud ... adult and serious for a movie for children (and it was a joke or two, though not the first time in a series). It is also useless of complexity, as is the plot in general. I can follow him, but I doubt a child might. Some of the exhibitions are delivered so obviously that even children may think it is bad. Animal animals are generally not funny. There are fewer brothers, which should mean that those who develop more, but have less personality than the slightest feature of those in the first two films. Generally, it's not particularly good, or it's worth looking, if you do not really love the killers hurt themselves in cartoon violence. I recommend this to the huge fans of the show. 3/10
