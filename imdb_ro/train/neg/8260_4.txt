First of all, I would like to point out that although I am not an expert, the way the process has been treated will insult your intelligence. Firstly, the Prosecutor's Office has never demonstrated that "facilitating learning" works. They are irresponsible for both criminal prosecution (because they can appeal) and for defense because they do not act in this respect. As another commentator said, facility learning was proven to be untrue. Second, they used Terry as a translator who has a personal interest and even testifies in the process that is stupid. If the court were allowed to testify in this respect, it would have brought someone neutral, otherwise it would only require a call. Thirdly, the child never asked specific questions about the accused by the Prosecutor's Office (birthmarks, event details, etc.), and even if he was asked about specific defense questions, such as when he started, he did not could answer. If this is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what a competent lawyer would have obtained an acquittal. The bottom line starts well with the pressures to be the parent of a child with autism, but the process makes this movie absolutely unbelievable.
