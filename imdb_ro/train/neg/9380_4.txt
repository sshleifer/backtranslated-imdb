In the last few weeks of a deadly dead woman's life is said in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the movie wanders inappropriately and rather meaningless. Mona, the lazy, sullen and drug-addicted character, is uncomfortable and Bonnaire does not do anything interesting. Although there is a pretentious dialogue trying to explain why Mona chose this miserable way of life, her motives are never clear. The episodic nature of the movie, involving some random characters, gets tedious after a while, making it look much longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not attract more attention from men.
