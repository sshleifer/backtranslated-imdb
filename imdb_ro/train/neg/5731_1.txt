I looked at the unclassified version of this movie and I realized that I had not recovered my time in about 30 minutes. We persevered to the end, hoping the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would look realistic in the end, the special FX would actually look special. I was so wrong. I like horror, I'm a full gore dog. I count a few of the movies with the brilliance of eighty of the best in the movie world. However, this was not done in the eighties, if this movie had come out in the early eighties, the fax could be forgiven that it seems so bad. It was not so he did not get the defense. The dialogue is terrible with so many bad ranks that I have earned in writing, rather than tormenting me. I do not like the Hostel, I have never had, I thought it was over rated, over hyped and I did not feel anything for the protagonists, however, it shines like a sea luncheon near this garbage. The back of the cover for Live Feed promised a turn that you will never see, still waiting for the twist that was promised.
