I've seen this time loss on HBO's Channel Comedy Channel, so I assumed it was quite innocent and obviously a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing fun here. A good cast is scattered in a scenario I could have written with my left cheek - after having been beaten with meaningless torture in the fifteenth century. The first half is particularly bad because it has some of the most boring and unnecessary dialogs that we have encountered in a while, and zero zero plot to talk. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and still this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, I should tell you everything. Some beautiful waves of photos hit the cold coast of Great Britain, but that's about it. It's kind of a movie that's just because those who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or a lot of money around.
