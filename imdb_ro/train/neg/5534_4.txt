I work in Horror Classics 50 and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I look at them with my seven-year-old daughter who makes most of these movies a laughing laugh. We had great hopes for the Zombie Revolution after watching White Zombie, which is really the precursor to so much that it's the support of the zombies in cinema (think of Clive Barker's Serpent and Rainbow and James Bond, Live and Let Die Die funeral scene, NOT Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> However, even if the title includes the word 'zombie,' it is little more than a triangle of love, involving anthropologist Armand Louque, who is struck by Claire Duval; which in turn is taken with Clifford Grayson's company. What kind of yawn, my daughter slept half. I had a difficult time to decipher for who these people were working - allies or axes; but I think that does not matter. I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in credits for this film; but of course these were his eyes (from White Zombie) serving as a mind control device for zombies.
