I'm a big fan of the old horror movies, and since I'm middle age, old for me is a movie made before 1970, most of them made in the 1920s and 1960s. I'm not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was wonderful. I would remember the story, but I really enjoyed the monster of the story with Hal Holbrook, and the one about the really clean guy was a wonderful ending. All the stories were wonderful. Why did I like it so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were exalted, with a fearful face, and the funny bits were even funny! This sequel is either lacking a lot of these elements or completely absent! I write this only after seeing it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things, such as writing the movies on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing, I'm telling you something ..... 4 out of 10. Also, Romero's experience is hard to find here, you must have told him to tune in to a standard PG "I do not know what this was rated, but it seems to me PG), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. It's displayed on the Encore cable channel if you die (yuck yuck) to see it.
