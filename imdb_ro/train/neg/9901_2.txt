This should have been a star, but there were so many, clich√©s, predictable twists, they saw everything before the parallel of the slasher strikes that actually gave them a supplementary star for making me laugh ... though this thing has never been directors of intent I'm sure. I often do not write reviews about movies, it has to be either sensational or in this case very bad. To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in him I knew he would be poor as he has a unique nose to choose the worst movies. Somehow this farce has made me look at all (probably not for Mr T's relay, but you'll know what I mean if you bother to look at that), if you look at it, make sure you do not pay it see . You might have worked if you had put a deliberate comedy on it, but I'm sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there, at the farce ...
