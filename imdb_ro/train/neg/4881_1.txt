This is the most boring piece of nonsense I've lost an hour of my life. All I can say is God's gratitude that it was only an hour. More than half of this "movie" is the film from the original "Criminal Insane". At least, I could see the most important moments in this classic rare exploit, because for some reason that does not fit reality, my video store has just "Criminal Insane II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II") . But the rest of this movie is one of the worst home cinemas and cinema behind the house you'll ever see. Why is my video store this and not the original? Why do stuff like that actually get into the video stores? Why do people rent it and do not burn the copy right after they've seen their horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? If you do not like to see annoying fruit consuming a whole candy bar in a tough scene, or say the fruit hangs from the stair railing in an even slower scene, or a character stabbed sideways (not asking) for several times in the back or brain cells that kill monologues about giving poisoned tea to your wife and then complaining that all the discussion has made your own tea cool, retarded eating soup or simply want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: Do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not walk over a shelf in a video store containing a copy of this movie. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
