this movie was terrible. I thought with all those who are decent actors, it would be better. Do not waste time. Eva longoria parker was terrible. she should stay at desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes actor B. The misery he made in the movie I would never have been your wife was the symbol of what I'm saying. and the lake bell was cute, but she certainly needed more acting lessons. watch the same as the river with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a bit better. or any other ghostly film. you will be grateful that you have not wasted your precious time. PS love you is also a good romance beyond tomb! time to start watching movies worth over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it.
