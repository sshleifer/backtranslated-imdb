A disappointment caused by yawning, unwashed by snail, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington), who is under investigation because of his involvement in a case of lack of money. When a bank is robbed and the hostages are kept against their will by a brainworm (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is designed to compel the thief to surrender himself? his only shot to prove he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a strong woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions sent to recover an item from the bank's security box that is stored in the bank, and you have a three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, everything you put in the film, and nothing ends in the end. Denzel Washington is the most uninteresting in an inefficient and disastrous egocentric performance. The only rescue of the film is its co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster offers the most striking high-caliber performance against the guy as a ruthless, slobbering villain. Clive Owen does not have much to do besides puppies and pictures, but the depth of his presence and his ability to do more than compensating for his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted on this impact film or little interest. You have to ask what director Spike Lee was thinking while creating this movie. The most inconvenient aspect of Inside Man is, however, how much praise has been received. For a movie that seemed to have all the features of a pre-summer blockbuster, it collapses horribly.
