Slowly, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder that Weinstein did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming and quitting production. You can not follow this and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea, not a feature. I'm sorry I rented this movie. I'm not going to track down Spurlock anymore on him. It's completely garbage. Filming like this should be on YouTube and never be given a distribution business. The film states that American consumers and their purchases are guilty of the current depression when buying and buying products, making money in the system as the basis of a healthy economy.
