It's incredible!! .. someone in front of me wrote that it was a time full of chairs and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do that! I am absolutely cheated! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found it fun to interpret his meaning in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (home only of course) but now (after) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor-play! Bad cameraman! Stupid script! Only one good thing thinks: that lovely girl! It must be a safe mannequin! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 minimum lines! I do not want you to miss that you have time to read my opinion! I hope, I was clear and under-stable, because English is not my native method of speaking. So you have time for barbecue and you see good movies, as if I was trying to ... Peace!
