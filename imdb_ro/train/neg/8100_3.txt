The Vanity Flames is a blurred movie in flop sweat. I do not remember any movie that has tried so hard to be so scandalous, challenging and important, but it has failed so consistently across the board. It's like a comic stand up that does not laugh but can not leave the scene. The harder the movie is, the louder, every laughing attempt results in a resounding crap. The despair that the movie shows is so brilliant that it almost provokes pity for all involved. The film only reaches the laugh-out status twice. Once in the sight of Geraldo Rivera, who plays a tabloid journalist, unpleasant, arrogant and amoral, which is funny only because obviously he does not realize he is playing alone. The other scene that deserves to be laughed is the last "great moment" of the film, in which Morgan Freeman's judge offers a holy lecture on what morality is ("what your mother has taught you"). The promise of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, we have to admit it is a noble effort. He has a good band of actors, if he is poorly distributed, trying to make characters from thin cartoon cartoons. The film looks professional and the little blooming cinematography that director Brian DePalma loves is obvious, if not particularly effective. The film, which seems to be a commentary on modern morality and ethics, never appears above the level of cartoons. Satire requires style. Farms require energy. Even the sitcom needs synchronization. But the best fireworks can be desperate. Finally, you do not want to laugh, you just want to go back.
