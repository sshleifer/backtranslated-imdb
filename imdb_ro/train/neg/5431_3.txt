This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of deceptive characters on a foolish mission. The culmination of the signature has the entire cast of the film that meets and fights with each other in a mad crazy over the hidden money. Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; as well as clich√©d and absurd his films, I usually enjoy comedy. However, in most of his earlier films he was actually a good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri being notorious). Now, the hilarity of his films fades as he uses the same formula again and again. The songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is OK and Sharman Joshi is the best.
