LOL! It's not a bad way to start. I thought it was original, but I discovered it was a clone of KING KONG's remake of 1976. I've never seen KING KONG until I was 15 years old. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. Funky music disco will be stuck in your head! Not to mention Yeti's thematic song. These are the most serious creatures I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy grail of B films. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put Yeti in your tank and you have Yeti power." I remember seeing this movie on the MOVIE MACRABE movie hosted by Elvira. There is a scene in which it was like KING KONG in the opposite direction! In KING KONG takes the girl and climbs into the building, but in this movie she climbs the building and grabs the girl (who falls)! Also that year was another KONG clone, MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), coming from Hong Kong. There are lots of mature scenes traveling and motorized body parts. This movie will let you laugh. It's like I said, just another clone KING KONG. PG called for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
