Most of the season 1 episodes are terrible. There is no comparison with the twilight area or the outer boundaries, because the programs actually have decent story lines. Most of the stunning stories are well boring .. not stunning at least .. to rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard Season 2 of this series is much better .. also for some reasons on DVD which Ray Walston cuts down, which further reduces this compilation. An interesting thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most story lines are very predictable, although the series might be better with ups and downs that let you ask ...
