For the known Beatles fans, the main value in this movie is to sit still and choose defects, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, exaggerated events, dead man, time errors, quotes, songs of place, and (Shame Shame ) of incorrect tools and other boners I just can not think of right now. The faults come quickly and angrily, so you have to be on your toes. I did not give a "1" first because it is filmed in Liverpool and actors (band Rain) give it all (Lennon is credible and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at some point and this matters to NIMIC. <br /> <br /> So, watch it for fun, but please do not take it as a historical point of view.
