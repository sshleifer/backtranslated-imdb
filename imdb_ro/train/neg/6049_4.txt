First, anyone who thinks this continuation of William Friedkin's film "The French Connection" is superior is certainly absolutely crazy or moronic, or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is that a.) It's a sequel to a brilliant movie that always makes it difficult to watch b.) It's directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted like. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug trafficking in the degradation of New York City because of his documentary approach to action and story, and Frankenhimer is one of the most elegant directors ever, "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds," and with "French Connection 2" he feels like someone who is trying to be stingy and has no real comprehension to shoot him. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel to Gene Hackman himself says really much about Hackman's understanding of the original film. It is well known that Hackman killed Friedkin on stage and promised to never work with him, it is also known that he imagined that the character is more dimensional, losing weight and trying to play it as a right character. shows you that Hackman, despite having been a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the great story. Doyle's plot to become addicted is interesting, but he does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate moment in Frankenhimer's film.
