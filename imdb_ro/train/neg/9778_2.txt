I'm sure Operations Dames was a favorite drive-ins back during the day. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot to lose if you were otherwise concerned. And if you needed a mood for other activities, you had some curvy boxes on the screen to get you in mood. Otherwise, there is not a whole operation that Operations Dames wants. It's settled in the Korean War, where a GI platoon along with a British tommy gets a little too far and has to go back to the UN lines. Pretty bad, but these guys also meet in a bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same difficult situation. You know what's sad about this movie is that the generations of women have ultimately had to be accepted by the army and in combat situations. These bumps from USO have set the years of women's freedom back. In fact, even the professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can not keep him in his pants. But perhaps it would be better to remind someone who was in the car for. This is not better, but I do not recognize any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Dames operations are definitely a team flop.
