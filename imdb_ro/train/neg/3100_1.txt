Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where Do I Start?! This film gives Manos - the hands of fate and the future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made. It's fun to laugh, where Manos was just painful to look at. Hobboblin will end in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term "80 years old cheesy." The act (and I use this free term) is atrocious, the Hobboblin are some of the worst dolls you will ever see and the struggle with the sculptures must be seen to be believed. The film was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and this version is the only way to track this mess. This movie gives Mike and beats a lot of ammo to shoot some of the funniest unique heads they've ever done. If you try to follow this without Mike and the robots ..... God help you!
