A great disappointment with writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration to "Homecoming" of the first season has been twisted and darkened in all the right ways. This weak manipulation of an interesting premise left me amazed. The supposed "salary" that showed the generic extraterrestrials who extracted something from the infected psychopathic brain was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the story strand was an alien "cleansing" of the planet of its human infestation, why did they do so in a way so free of sadism and misogyny? Why not unleash a completely lethal virus at Stephen King's "Stand" instead of having males to slaughter females? We continue to hope that the episode will improve as I watch, but it has become more demanding and absurd. The religious subtext seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought he was profound by the weight it gives. I like a lot of Dante's and Hamm's works, but that was just indescribable.
