A film about the Harlem Renaissance and a single author in particular. It contrasts with a modern story about a young, gay and black artist. If it sounds vague, that's because the movie itself is. It is well guided, well written and (mostly) well acting. Also, scenes from the past are shot in black and white. It is also one of the few films dealing with homosexual men who do not move away from sexual scenes (not so explicitly or frontally). Still, I looked the most. The film moves everywhere, it is full of characters that can not be personalized (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) is moving in the snakes' rhythm. Three times I thought I left the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there, so we stayed. <br /> <br /> His talks say this was a love work and it took 6 years to complete. I really want to like more (there are very few movies that deal honestly with gay blacks), but I can not. If you are not very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, you have no reason to see this.
