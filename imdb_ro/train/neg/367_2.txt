A boy comes in a lot of money and immediately begins to live it. Unfortunately, the man whose bank is really going to be very bad. He wants his booty back. When he discovers who has the money, he starts to try to receive it. He continues to be impeded by this little child, who is lucky enough not to fall into the hands of evil man. Sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not at all interesting. Come with something different, ok guys?
