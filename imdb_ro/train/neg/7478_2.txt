When I saw the previews of this movie I thought it might be bad, but at least it would be funny. I was wrong. Even if somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message telling their parents being left alone and reevaluating their lives, the way they tried to bring the message was horrible. The first fifty times horrible thing that happened to the couple was relatively funny. But, to the end, I could almost predict what bad wrong will happen next. Throughout the movie, I like five dialogue lines and everything else was the best mediocre, more than I can say for the film itself.
