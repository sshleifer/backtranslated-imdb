Today we found "Everybody laughs" on VHS for sale in a rental. It was a very old and very used VHS, I did not know about this movie, but I liked the references on the cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched for IMDb, and 6.0 User Rating was a great reference. I looked in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and? Wow ?? four stars! So I decided I could not lose more time and I see it right away. Indeed, I just finished watching "Everybody laughed" and it sounded like a very boring film. Characters are poorly developed and spent a lot of minutes to understand their roles in the story. Complot should be funny (private eyes falling in love with the women they are watching), but I did not laugh all along the story. Coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra, as an attractive and seductive man, with the women who belonged to him as if he were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is ridiculous. Eventually, the bigger attractions are surely the presence of the Playboy and Playmate of the Year, Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband long after the release of this film and whose life was featured in "Star 80" and "Centerfold: The story of Dorothy Stratten "; the stunning beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, the future lady Keith Richards; Audrey Hepburn, always wonderful, even for 52 years; and the song "Amigo," by Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 1960s and is named by his fans as "The King." I will keep this film in my collection only due to these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laugh and much happiness")
