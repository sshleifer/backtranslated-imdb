This series has occasional ups and downs, and the latter is the case here. There is a nice amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of Baby Cart, but the editing movie is very divided, the film being more shameful than usual. Sometimes the action slows to a crawl, while the camera follows the wandering words of the "chicken", which is lost almost early. All this, disappointment. That being said, there is an Eastern spaghetti quality for music and action that could win the approval of dedicated viewers. This tranche spends much of its time following small mistakes of the boy, who begins to look at the abyss of death that his father opened for him.
