I will not waste the time to write a little more about how every aspect of this movie is unbelievable. This has been done in detail already, many times. "The plot" began as a very inertia of boys / gangsters in large numbers and very quickly descended in a crossroads. Whoever pretends to be able to see a hidden masterpiece inside this terrible misery, they joke. Now I'm 7 or 8 years old when I watched it during a week at the cinema before it's shot, but it's still in my mind that I'm easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Just make these comments, and the only reason I went to see the movie is because my brother Eddie appeared in him as the second "hard" in the pub scene. He had his hands a zippo lighter against Rhys Ifan's face in the bar of "Russia" (actually, he was filmed at Barry Island's former Butlins holiday camp). My brother has absolutely no experience of acting - he recently joined an extraordinary agency and this was his first part. After seeing the movie, it seemed that no one needed any experience to act. I remember that there were about 8 people in the cinema - and that was only a few days after it was released. I have never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and rightly so. If you thought about renting this movie on DVD, I would recommend instead you put the two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then lock them in the eye sockets. This will probably be less painful than watching the movie.
