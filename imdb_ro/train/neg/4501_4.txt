True, the situation in Paris is wonderful. The actors are fine. The story is a twisted piece of morality. You have to say that if you want someone bad enough, is it okay to hurt everyone else along the way? In a true love story, you want to want a smaller clich√© than the one who gets bored with his wife and is willing to throw back his family and the woman who is fine, encouraging him to do so. So if I'm looking decent and if Karen Allen shows her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and condemnable. Perhaps the moral of this story is "get what you deserve". I give it a 4, only for the fast scanning potential through the "male interest" bits.
