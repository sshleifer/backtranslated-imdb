I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, it seemed strange and totally useless ... so I decided to go around and took my hands on the copy of the 70s. Wow. what difference. The original was much better. I would like you to acknowledge that he had just made an initial statement, that the existence had a purpose. In fact, the Christian public has expressed fear of Paganism. If you look deeper into it, you also make comments on life, but I do not want to go into the details simply simply if you were disappointed and would like to know how it should look, Version 70, a little dated but much better.
