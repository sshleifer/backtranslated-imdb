I've been trying to see this movie three times. The night we rented it. I had about 20 minutes in the hope that it would be better to have a night rest. He watched another 15 days the next day, almost vomited at how bad he was ... It was not even a stupid funny, sometimes a fun movie to watch, but this movie was simply a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally, on the third day, I watched an awesome time and I did not enjoy it for a moment! None. How did this scenario get green? Oh boy! 1/10 - one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their work.
