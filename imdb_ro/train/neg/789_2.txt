five minutes after watching this I logged on to IMDb to warn everyone from outside not to bother with this movie ... gen: horror? had moments of light suspense and throughout the movie I thought about myself "something must happen soon" did not ... when the movie was over I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director I was never the biggest fan of patrick bad This guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this evil excuse of a horror hit I left from was not the biggest fan not to track his other work. . <br /> I was taken over by the summary of the plot, please do not make the same mistake. I gave this movie a 2 for the actors ... were not bad and there was no guilt there got the wrong direction ...
