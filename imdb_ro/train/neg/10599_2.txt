** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. Soldiers are now stronger and are able to do more damage than before. However, the government is resolving, the project is endangered, and the supercomputer in the midst of all feels threatened, so take steps to ensure its own safety. He activates and controls UniSols and begins to run into chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreographic correction. The story is bad, and is soon drowned in all the fighting. Whatever happens and wherever they go, they will fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it is not fun to watch a fight where you know that part of it is indestructible. Normally, you're sure the hero will win, but still you want to feel that the fighting is between two equal combatants. Not where someone is indestructible and can not lose. Then the struggles become just a tool of time. Wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable opponents. To further reduce my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of an evil film is how much women are dressed in a scarce fashion. Well, there are not many, because the characters are the most men (there are at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman is shown useless with at least one bra at a time. The female leaders go through this, but we also go through a strip club (use a computer no less) with more naked women. These moments give nothing to the story and are just there to try to please the teenage male audience. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, the boring struggles. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... 2/10
