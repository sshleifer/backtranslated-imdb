It hurts me to write such a clear review, but without doing so, I simply encourage these people. First of all, just because a movie is made on a small budget is not automatically done good or great. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only movie made by preventing large amounts of money from being scattered on a horse-drawn horse. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theater? Have you ever heard people laughing and thought "what are you in love with?" Well, even those tricks did not laugh. Things worsened halfway, my cat took his first bath. This movie is not a movie, the kids are ... not monkeys making pictures that let you feel like you moved into France. I have to go, it's a clown at my door .............
