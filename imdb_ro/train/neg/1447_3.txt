In 1934, Shirley Temple played three major films and began to make a name for himself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the audience liked best here. Two of these things were singing and dancing. Another movie was a short, exciting film that kept people's attention and the minds of the Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful films. This film did not reach any of the above, despite the presence of stars by Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts that are simply boring, and too many arguments between a Lombard spear and Cooper. To summarize this, you did not get the normal end of common sense - what the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
