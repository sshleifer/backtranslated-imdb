Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and this writer should read it. I hate it when writers use the Spark notes for what it is about a novel. This movie is unbearable to watch if you read the book. The whole "red room" is so low that I wonder why she even bothers to put it. In the book "The Red Room" is the prefiguration for the whole story and for the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the film I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. and it was not the red head The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and from the rest of the movie Do a favor and miss this movie and read the story, as Charlotte Bronte has said in a wonderful way.
