I remember the show. I still remember that America's fun song "fun". Honestly, it should have been called the American lame or disgusting or even disgusting people. Dave could not save this show, and neither Bob Saget nor AFV replacement hosts who came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes, Dave could make good voices that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of videos laced with tears. It has also grown like a variety of brilliant performances including Olson Twins. In addition, AFV was at the forefront of getting to pick those who won the ugly spit as sinful children. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the stones theme song!
