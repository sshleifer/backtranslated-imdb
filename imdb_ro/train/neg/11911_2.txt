I sat on the screen, ripped, yawned, while keeping a careful eye. I've been waiting for the next rough, or the next ridiculous plot of clich√©, to show you the maximum force, so I could learn how to make a movie. It seems that when they decided to do this, the crew followed every other action / science fiction / filming-shoot-up / good vs. evil ever done and saw cold things and said, "Hey, we can do that." For example, the only car parked in a kilometer on what appears to be a one-way street with a non-parking car shoulder is the only car on which the protagonist is thrown, an attractive brunette born from the ball. The car blows into pieces before she can sit on it. The special effects were obviously the biggest beef with this movie. But what really put in my evil books was implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to cause damage in bizarre ways, happens after a lone military truck carrying an important VIP. Unnamed security guys with arms go out of the truck, you know they're already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says: "You do not leave this truck, do you understand me?" Get out to find the beast that killed his three friends, he died in a rather comical manner. Then, for no apparent reason, defies logic, convention and common sense, the stupid VIP withdraws from the stroller! A lot of what happened during the movie did not make sense. Transparent action has distracted my film, as well as the inappropriate work of the room and things that make you go: "Wow, it's incredible cheese." Shiri Appleby saved the movie at 1, for giving the film an element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience of sexual intercourse.
