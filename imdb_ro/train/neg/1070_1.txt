I have seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so terrible that it was so half and could not see the rest. Sin. Offering talents such as Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what happened? Branagh is a big-law attorney who has one night off with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hung his cat, etc. etc., so Branagh sent him to a cat and he's getting out of his way. Somehow (I did not realize how) Robert Downey Jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed up in the story that moves slower than the stationer. I wanted to like this and, being a huge fan of Grisham, I read everything about this movie and I (crazy) was expecting something interesting. This is the MULTE movie I have seen so far and I wish I could repay my money. * of *****.
