I have the courage to inform you to move away from the film Dahmer, the biographical film based on the real story of the grotesque serial killer. "Dahmer" strives more in relation to the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed over 15 young men and ate several parts of the body, was probably the most unconscious serial killer of our generation. However, true sick individuals are the producers of this dreadful show, which should have examined their heads before deciding to test this terrible "dahm" project. This is not an easy-to-digest film, although Jeffrey would easily digest it with some "brainsadillas" or even some real "potato peel".
