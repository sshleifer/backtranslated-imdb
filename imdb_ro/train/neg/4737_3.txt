I liked the first film "Azumi". I saw Mrs. Ueto in a variety of appearances on television and saw a fair share of samurai and ninja movies. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. Given the distribution of the film and set up in "Azumi", it should have done a much better job with this film, but instead was slow, plodding in parts, and sprinkled with very weak, unconvincing, and acting from wood. When they bothered to refer to the first film, they did it in a way that was pretty loose and weak. In Azumi, the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In "Azumi 2" it seems to be somewhat diminished and less impressive. That does not mean it was a total loss. There have been some decent fighting scenes and some characters everywhere. Unfortunately, the film generally suffers from the fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two have really captured the "manga" feel in their script, while the first has never been "pretty".
