In the opening stage of "History of Malta," Mr. A.Guinness had a surprising resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be "Certain women must strike regularly - such as gongs" - his dialogue it is hard to die without death and even the Master would have had problems in bringing his life alive. The idea that Mr. Guinness is wandering through the picture as if he were looking for a focal point and not finding one. And here is the fatal weakness of the whole movie. Also, Mr. J. Hawkins quits from the beginning and ends with a "Jack Hawkins" performance without an ounce of individuality. He could have been drawn from any of the dozens of British war films. Many of the fifty ordinary suspects return and make their schtick for very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta in obedience the same way it did not bring London to its knees. The courage of the Maltese people in the face of unceasing danger was recognized by the king, and the island was distinguished with George Cross. a subject worthy of thinking about a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most patronizing sense. He says he has hurriedly traveled to meet a deadline, probably before the actors lose to live.
