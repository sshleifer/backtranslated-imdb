The first 30 minutes of the shooting were cumbersome and hard to know exactly what happened (if you did not read the book - which I did not have). If you can stay in the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet anyway. <br /> <br /> The way he was shot might have been believed to have been produced in the early 1980s, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> I did not realize that I did not, he never bore the exceptional moments, but he moved without getting bored. I want to know why Keaton chose this role, her side would have been better expressed with a more player at the level of other actors to maintain balance.
