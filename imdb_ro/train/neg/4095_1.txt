Today, Bea Arthur died, so I was cruising around the IMDb Web site and somehow finished on a show called "Gloria." "All In The Family" was a brilliant show for the first four or five years and I bet I've been watching each episode several times. However, I swear I did not know there was a show called "Gloria". Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it means we had a life rather than a young adult than watching television. On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "All In The Family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it shows that I have never heard of one that is badly rated by previous reviewers. I rated the show 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to record a vote, and television writers and executors should be condemned to start a show that had no business in the air and encompasses the memory of one bigger shows in television history. Shalom, Zwrite
