This movie disappointed me. It seemed very much like the Jaws of the movie when the Hopper told the mayor the closure of the parks was like when Roy Shider told the mayor to close the beaches. They both did not even say his summer! But the tape says Hopper has to get into a murderer's mind and think like one. But he does nothing interesting or interesting. I am not even convincing that he and his partner have an experience of doing police work when they are in the office asking how they will resolve this case. I just say they let the police work and we'll solve it. And what happens to all the old guys with the clues at the pool. I did not even think they were bosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy the monkey chose to find the murderer. With her haircut of a hundred dollars and that he thinks Di @ k is the size of a school. Come on rough lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like the other movies. I used this movie and would not buy it again. I suggest you ignore this movie. And it was fun to see the microphone above the scene where the hopper goes to get the coffee.
