Despite positive reviews and projections at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other films in which a teenager in the immigrant family has to overcome many personal common issues of her age and also fight the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does this by choosing a sport and with the help of a local boy who, for some reason, falls in love with her, confronts her problems and wins. In Girlfight's boxing, in Bend it's like Beckham is football, and now it's Kung Fu. But Fighter is a much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to follow it. Semra Turan, the actress playing a teenage role, can do many things, but one thing she can not do is act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations in which she tries to show emotions, are terrible, her body and facial language are amateur actresses, poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but it can not save this film with clich√© with stereotypical characters and superficial plot. Besides some relatively good moments this film has nothing new or interesting to offer. Even fighting kung fu is not a reason to pursue this, it's just so boring. The slow movement was really useless, the choreography was basic and did not have the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in any kind of kung fu positions, actually not fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it seems when a small and weak girl struggles with the big and muscular boys and kicks them. <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie has been noticed is that it is European. It's very easy to publish this movie - A first martial arts film in Denmark, but do not be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about a stupid teenage girl and her problems, which, by the way, are not really convincing. Bad film with embarrassing lines, acting and story.
