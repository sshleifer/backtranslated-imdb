"Everything could be a great documentary"? Yes, if one is deaf, dumb and blind. Everything except sense, spirit, visual style and interesting subjects. Besides. . . <br /> <br /> Seriously. This is a film that is completely inappropriate. An unattractive adventure dock, a dock of war without a sense of war, a campless footprint. It does not mean anything, it does not feel like nothing, and it carries the default message that does not matter absolutely. No wonder he has so many IMDb fans! Of course, going inside you know a movie in which the great Skip Lipman plays will have no culture, no intelligence, no intelligence (other than a corrosive adolescent joke) and no recognized human emotion? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentaries and too little time in life to lose them on the toilet like "Darkon".
