I could not relate to this movie. He failed to engage me intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and uninterested. I could not connect and, therefore, care about any of the characters and find it hard to find many positive things to say about it. I read that to understand correctly what it takes to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that as an atheist I may not be familiar with many of the finer details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films dealing with the religious issues that have touched upon my theme because their themes are still universal to the human condition and do not rely on specialized knowledge or beliefs.
