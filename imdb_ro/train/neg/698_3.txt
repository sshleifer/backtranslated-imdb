An uninteresting addition to the "slash" cycle that dominated the horror genre of the 1980s. This movie was shot as Pranks, but was released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which is a clear thief from the horror anthology of the 1970s, The house that creaked the blood. Daphne Zuniga is the only known girl in the cast and this was her first horror movie (she also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).
