The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. The terrain is terrible ... but the plus part of the acting is pretty good, with a few shouts and good stuttering. Stone Sharon is OK this time ... not even half as good as you. Killing is not as disturbing as the first, which is a shame. It's not the unpredictable mess, everyone says it's still. Sex is pretty graphic sometimes while others are clear that they are fake (they are completely dressed). The scenario is poor many times, but the scenes with banter and arguments between Dr. Glass and Washburn are highlighted. The plot twists a few times, but the end is terrible. The tension is always constant, with a huge dollop of "God!". The sequencing sequences are brilliantly directed, and the camera's camera and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to a different, unlucky film. Stone Sharon is a bit old for this too. The particles in which we see our breasts were, first of all, delicious. This time, they are too horrible to describe. His films are rather average, but worth a go. Mainly because the movie deserves a good pocket ... with the opening sequence being a climax. Do not be critical, but if you liked it first - leave this. Do not destroy the run. You will be glad to have left this stone untouched.
