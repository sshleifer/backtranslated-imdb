"Seed" is the start of torture ... no doubt. But, strangely, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a polished film more than any other he made in his recent memory. Every time I watch a Boll movie, I feel that some pages of the script must have disappeared. There are simply great loopholes in the story and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense. The films are somewhat surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** Why go six policemen to arrest Seed split up and go their separate ways when they reach the residence dark, unlike police real ones who would enter and delete the house in pairs or in three? Why do not the police ever use radios? How can the bodies fall off so quickly, a process that would normally take several months? (I know it's photo time ... but Seed would never be able to kill people if they had always expected to relax the victim prior to the point shown.) How is it that Seed dress overalls and a mask while waiting dying instead of typical uniforms in prison? How can sow to enter into a maximum security prison, cell block to walk through and then out again without being stopped or even noticed? If nearly 80 people were killed (according to certain newspaper articles in the film), why is there only one investigator working on this case? Why investigator suddenly decided we should go to seek Seed Seed's house, where he was initially arrested and where he killed his victims? (Not thought to do that earlier?) Why police detective go solo without backup and without leaving dispatcher to know what and where are they heading? is particularly frustrating when Boll clearly goes out of his way to make sure we understand why the electric seat does not work properly. He spends more screen minutes in setting this up when he could have spent doing other aspects of the movie at least a bit more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <In short, the film serves only as a framework for several assorted scenarios (maybe Boll might think of them as his "visions" ) of a crude death by blows, gunfire, execution by electric shock, and skinning of live animals raised for fur. (The opening scenes of the animals that were skinned were really useless and disturbing, but they understand their purpose in the context of the film.) In the center of the film there is undoubtedly the mild death of the middle-aged woman by Seed using a hatchet. Obviously that was spent this much time and vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", although without Steely Dan soundtrack. Is it a good movie? Is not it worth to see? Only if you are a fan of torture porn or if you are absolutely determined to see a sample of porn torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, even if this movie is quite disgusting and can be bad in points, it really is more competent than most of Boll's films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a director. I can only hope that it progresses beyond the pornography of torture and continues more in "Post".
