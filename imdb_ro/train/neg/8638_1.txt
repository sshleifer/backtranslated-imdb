Action, violence, sex and coarse language are the things that characters do during the whole movie. And everything they do is without reason. Mark L. Lester is (not) known for his violent films (no reason) (Commando, The Base). The story is weird, but bad. The actors play very well their silly characters ... I'm not saying they're stupid, but I mean very bad actors. It's another unknown action movie in the B-Series with a low budget. If you've seen something like Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or something similar to these bad movies of the same kind as Misbegotten ... do not rent it ... and, by the way, do not rent any of the movies I have mentioned ... give them 1 and a half of 5.
