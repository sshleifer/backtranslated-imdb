I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. She reminds me of a porn class c, with a major difference: no porn. Story and dialogue need a complete review. Perhaps then the bad action would not have been as visible. At least the rhythm should have been taken. While I accept that this has had a low budget, and the director has done a good visual job, given the low resources they have had, she should have spent more time on the story or better, bring it on someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were just useless. It was a total loss of my time.
