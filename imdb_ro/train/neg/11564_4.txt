Horror film / Italian suspense about a wealthy English gentleman who cut pubs and taverns for red hair girls, just like his recently deceased wife, Evelyn. You know that he really loved his wife, because he brought them home - a huge and rotting castle - and made them strip and then torture, whip and kill them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that, in a way, after the end of the movie, we see this guy that Antonio De Teffe interprets as the film's HERO. Anyway, soon, under the guidance of Uncle Playboy Roberto Maldera, De Teffe sets up with a girl she meets at his uncle's party. It's moving and weird things start to happen with De Teffe's fragile mood. He starts to see him and hear his dead wife and, finally, well, look at the title if you're still curious. Also, family members and friends start to die in the most brutal fashion. Little aunt Agatha (seems to be even younger than De Teffe and in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a rude way. Another man is injected and buried alive. And, of course, there is a complete explanation of what Evelyn did and what he did. Director Emilio Miraglia does some things pretty well: the film settings are suited to this film, although they try to make us think that England is ridiculous at best. None of the actors show English. Many of them having dark black hair and Mediterranean skins and clothed clothes, an Englishman would not have been caught dead. Cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But, however, the encrypted scene was actually shot and I liked the cheese resolution as well. And, of course, any Erika Blanc movie with a red head is always a plus. There are a number of sexual perversions; however, I found somewhat awful about the idea that women's torture was good enough and healthy to relieve one of its mental demons. Come on.
