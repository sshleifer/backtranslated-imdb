What a terrible movie. The act was bad, the rhythm was bad, the cinema was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of harm in a slasher, but even the crimes were bad. First of all, the past event that created the reason for slaughter continued for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have eliminated 80% of it and explained what happened pretty well. Then the victims were invited to a "reunion" in an abandoned school, which still had all the utilities turned on. One of the victims thought it was a little strange, but they rejected it and decided to fall apart anyway. Eventually, the killing was so fake that it was virtually undetectable. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie if you do not want to see some breasts and not your very good breasts. This film makes Showgirls virtually impossible to distinguish Citizen Kane.
