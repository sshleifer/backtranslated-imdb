It was a disappointing film. Considering the material - the life of the army is always good for a laugh --- and the stars, this movie should have been a laughing laugh. It was worth a few chicks, at best. Steve Martin was much more fun than that and it seems Dan Ackroyd should stay in dramatic roles where he could follow Robin Williams and win an Oscar one day.
