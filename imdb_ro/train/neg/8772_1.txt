There's nothing new to say to me: 4 hours of people always dying in the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / publisher / God appeared. He would have had to eat a humble pie (if not for his own sake, then for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these bolly directors from Bollywood, hired a true screenwriter, hired a real editor, hired a a musician who was not tied to (and who seemed to have listened to a bad version of "The Revelation Now" on a cheap Indian drug), hired a professional crew, threw all the firearms, and told a real story. Unfortunately, he, like the Indian army wizards, made terrible decisions for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all have always died. <br /> <br /> Please do not do this again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal ps: The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha Regiment, I suggest employing more than one Nepal to represent the team. Of course, there are a lot of Nepali men working in Bombay - the last number was 40,000 to half a million.
