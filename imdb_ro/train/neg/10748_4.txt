Nothing to say except Wow! In fact, someone had someone to sneak into them in an open field? Well, this happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly, the directors prefer tactics scares). In one of the opening scenes, the hot / speaker maker has to walk in the back seat so that the camera man can stand up to shoot. Shortly after arriving on the field, the five competitors are present and, although it is obviously no later than 2pm, everyone is convinced that the sun will put every minute. After about 30 minutes of rubbish, we are privileged with a retrospective of clown history where we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check the ladies' chest .. its ribs go up to the neck, it was unpleasant. Most horror movie acts take place during the night, but without a night viewing room, chaos is forced to happen during the day. Some night shots that they did in the movie show that they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors' court. The film eventually redeemed when there was a matrix like shooting the clown that we revolted and looking over and over hysterical laughter. Surely, RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE IN THE OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNATURE, RESPONSE
