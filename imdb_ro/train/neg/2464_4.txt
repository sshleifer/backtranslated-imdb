Love Part One, The Impossible Planet, but man, which is a disappointing part two "Satan's Pit". Those who rose from the pit, who apparently rose, did not come out of the pit. Then the ages crawled the round ventilation holes to get the story out, Beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence, so no Doctor / bastard confrontation that I'd anticipated. TARDIS is somehow in the pit, despite the fact that the pit was not opened too long after TARDIS fell through the crust of the planet. And finally another ready-made solution without any logical reason - that is, why do not you throw the Beast in the Hole as soon as the pit opens? Why not throw it away all those years instead of closing it anyway. Why can not I continue, but I lost interest ...
