About the baby: Why did not the older brother suppose he would be hungry for a bottle, a food or a diaper change? She would have to scream without interruption for many hours without care. Definitely stupid to take the child out of a safe place when he did not need it. Why was the road clearly miraculous whenever someone wanted to drive somewhere? I did not imagine the cops from the road not following immediately after a young man who had collapsed, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That being said, it was nice to have a movie that children could watch safely for a change.
