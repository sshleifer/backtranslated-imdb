There is no spoilers here, but I was a Wake the Dead fan, but the last series, of which only 3 were still, is terrible. Stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I discovered these 3 in the last jawbone series that got rid of ridicule. As a BBC licensee, after the show I called the BBC's complaints to convey my disappointment. I am surprised that Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone's giant actors have not objected to story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, rather they can see that it has lost all direction. It is a good thing that is the last series or the next series can start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas! Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
