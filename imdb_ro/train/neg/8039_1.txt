This mindless film is a piece of nonsense and boring as full rehearsals. For all people who want to see a cool, cool and cool movie, they should not even think about watching this mindless business bouquet. an F - in my opinion. I have a question, what are they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad action 5) bad director and last but not least a bad script. I mean, I'm not like he was swallowing every movie, but I was disappointed when I watched him. This film should be banned in a box, blocked and submerged in the sea. So, please do not do that again, please, please!
