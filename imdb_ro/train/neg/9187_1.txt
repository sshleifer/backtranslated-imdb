I've been watching some pretty poor movies in the past, but what the hell they were thinking about when they made this movie. If the production crew would turn into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​doing so, for sure you must be dead brain to find any joy in it. I'm a fan of most genres and enjoy "pull them up", but blending the game scenes in this game has made it ridiculous and indescribable. As most scenarios have already said, the scenario has been poor. I will not waste the time to describe it. Anyone who appreciates this movie above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, or otherwise have a very distraught entertainment concept. > <br /> I have to say that I was more disturbed by the video store, which gave me a big finger, which made me rent it. Thank God I had a second film to watch to restore some of my belief in the movies. The type of comic book would be right if he said "The worst movie ever"!
