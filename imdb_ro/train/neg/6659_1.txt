During the first three seasons, strange parents were just as tasty as heavy, bright and sweet candies. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you will need after watching the latest episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that have not laughed. Cosmo, once one of Nick's most bold characters, turned into an abusive creature he did not want to know. Timmy became an arrogant selfish jerkwad that Bart Simpson would have beaten fiercely (and considering Timmy's husband who would take a lot of beating). And poor Wanda ... a true charm that has become her husband's divine husband, is now labeled as a "nag" to care for the well-being of others. Plus, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he is never punished for it, nor does he teach any lesson. Which pretty much compares Butch Hartman's attitude to children: they are cruel, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God that this was canceled, along with darling Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. At least Butch has achieved what it deserves - unlike Cosmo.
