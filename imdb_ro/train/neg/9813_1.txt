... and I saw a few bad things. I have nothing to say about this movie. The action is faint by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah is doing a good job, but he is not nearly able to save this movie. The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer has recourse to a "stupid heroin trick" to create a controversial suspense. When all Daryl Hannah should do is hide, she leaks out in front of her follower. The scene of the hospital is absurd. Without showing too much of what goes on for a plot, I think it would be difficult for a small woman by the blood to carry a pregnant woman out of a hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very bold. <br /> <br /> Save yourself a little time and choose another move.
