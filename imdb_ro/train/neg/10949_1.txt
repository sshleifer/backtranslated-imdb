I'm going to the cinema to be entertained. There's absolutely nothing about this movie. From the beginning to the end, there is no respite from the gray reality, grinding the life of this woman. It is a step without any mood swings. I stayed to the end only because I was convinced that things need to improve. They do not believe, and I do not think I'm the only one, as it turns out from the many groans that sounded around the cinema, while the film was moving gracefully close. Honor describing social depravity is not a crime, but the boredom of your moaning audience is not the way to win public sympathy. A horrible movie.
