I bought the DVD version of this movie, on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw broadcast on television. But the DVD version was a disaster. Enlightenment was weak until nonexistent, and whole scenes were simply excluded. In one situation, Adele is put in bed and immediately cut to another scene - coming in the middle of the sentence - where it is the next day. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason are not even introduced, letting someone wonder if they disappeared for a few minutes during the movie. The DVD I saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We send them back.
