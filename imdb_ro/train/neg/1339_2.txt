A sad and sad look is indeed Munster's Revenge. The Munsteri are brought back for the last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge salary to return to Herman Munster's role) in this television movie about a pair of grandfather's wax replicas and Herman, robots who "terrorize" preparation for a mummy stamping at an exhibition. With the police on the heels, the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes to erase his name. We will see how they embrace themselves as waitresses (a minor point in the film), the grandfather turns into a battered wire several times (one flies to Transylvania, with Herman somehow invoking his frequent myth); a most annoying relative "The Phantom" constantly plays and breaks the ad nausium bottle! What is saddest is hard to say: is that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material. These are the hockey outfits of the robots that have those values ​​of school production about them. Maybe it's ridiculous scenario. Sid Caesar is crazy, largely unhappy. Or maybe I see something that has brought me joy and pleasant memories as a child who is treated to a super fashion K-Mart makeup. In any case, the result is certainly disappointing and stupid even for the Munster standards. As for the rest of the featured pieces, Yvonne De Carlo is suited to a very naked role (although it has a greater declivity than usual for a woman of her years and her experience). K.C. Martell makes an Eddie Munster, which is never appealing. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings, as the Phantom mentioned above, shows, acts and speaks most absurdly. The film has a cheap reality about it even for a movie made for television.
