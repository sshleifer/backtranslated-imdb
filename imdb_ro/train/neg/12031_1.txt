First of all, this movie is not a comedy; if you do not really force yourself, you can hardly laugh. Second, the movie is slow and boring. The act is not bad, but it is not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy, and this film only confirms this rule. There is a similar comedy "Teachers at Home"; this has had some good moments. My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring movie.
