My children look at the show every day. It is a great program for younger children. However, they must stop presenting re-runs and make more real shows and escape Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle pocket with teeth with white pearls, and the kids write down these things and ask if they never brush their teeth? The exhibition is ever heading to the United States and, if so, where we can find our schedule. And one more thing if we could add. Moe must stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you get up from where you do not scare the younger children and what are you pulling the rope? What this means? other than wetting all the time. They must add new things to their show instead of the same ole. Children lose interest in this way.
