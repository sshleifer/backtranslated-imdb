I do not think you can get much worse than that. Put together evil actors, false members and three silly stories and what do you get? This excuse without excuse B for a movie. The first story immediately shows the bad video quality, and the acting is just really pathetic, especially when you are 25 years old as a grandmother with grandmother's grandmother usually over the ears. Besides, the man is OK, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look good!" NOT! The wanderer of this was the best of the three I would say, but it is still not impressive because it was a bad outfit. The girl on the woman later was pretty decent for Halloween, but not for a werewolf film. The more stories you get through the worst. There are two lesbians in the next, who completely delay their ridicule. The whole "I want to be a werewolf" "How could you do that to me?" It was stupid to say. You asked for now to overcome it! The wanderer will not even talk about ... a rat! The third is of no use ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narrative make up this story, and the whole thing of switching has not yet made it interesting. Boring! Music, Yes, bad ... who could not hear even a few parts, was stupid. The effects of the animals were either rat or pig, which was bad. Could not use lion's sounds? Guess no, good movies use this. Well, if you enjoy B-rates, that's good for you. I've taken this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I'm going to buy a werewolf movie and watch it more than once, but that's just me. If you prefer the good, do not waste money. I beg you!
