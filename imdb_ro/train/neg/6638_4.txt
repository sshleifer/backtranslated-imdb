A note addressed to all emerging film writers: study this movie. If your dialogue reads as the dialogue in this movie, please cut your script and try again. We did not have big expectations, but he was intrigued by the description that indicated there was a mystery to Christmas Fabric Ornament. The mystery is solved very early, and the movie becomes a love story. I almost stopped 5 minutes, 10 minutes and the first break. My husband, who is the Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a city of the company - the main business is the Aikens Ornaments, which make all sorts of holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company recently died, so the future of the companies could be in question. Soon we will meet Noelle, who would be on Wall Street rather than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who has a meeting with Noelle after a big snowman he infuses, collapses in Justins' car. Once we meet Alison Aikens, doing a diligence for the board of directors, we have our installation story. If you can not put all your story bows at the first commercial break, you have not seen enough of a holiday movie. Maybe it's a good thing.
