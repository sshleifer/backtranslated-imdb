"Masters of Horror" turned out to be a bad arena for "episodes of the message," and while a "Screwfly Solution" case (one of the best episodes of the series, the period) could be made, most of the efforts to doing so have met as a wagon heavy and unimpressive (nothing terrifies the horror more than a soapbox). And "Pro-Life" simply combines the reactionary viewpoint with ultra-violence; young man Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), saw he ran through the woods, is almost struck by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who are just moving to work at the local (and isolated) clinic of abortion. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a cold-blooded, extreme-right role that will do anything to prevent his daughter from receiving an abortion. If there is nothing else, Pro-Life has garnered some rumors about his controversial subject, but John Carpenter treats this entire business with amazing indifference - he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script himself (which is often poor ) the slow pace does not tighten up any tension and simply brings up a plot already embedded in a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons are overturning in the clinic, their weapons are burning, it is an amazing event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a "male abortion", the scene moves away as free and useless - an effort to remove the subscribed film. Poor performance (Perlman scattered here) is an increase in the script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" is the source of his next hot meal. Until a human-headed spider creature and a guy in a latex silk suit walk around the hallways, you have to wonder what the minds behind this mess ...
