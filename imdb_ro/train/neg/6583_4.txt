An interesting idea and an interesting story that did not work well. When you see the movie, you may feel uncomfortable at the end, as we did. I did not really know where to turn you into the movie, Taye Diggs seemed bored as a detective, the rest of the characters seem so un-dimensional and unpleasant. If Victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was rather a pretty girl, we might have enjoyed the fact that I saw the separation and that the perpetrator was brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bad as the other girls, turning from a sweet girl to an opportunistic chic. I do not understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective and thriller story, it does not work.
