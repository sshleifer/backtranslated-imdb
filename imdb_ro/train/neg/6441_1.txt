When I looked at this Wrestlemania card, I was so stoked and unable to control myself because I was full of emotion. It starts ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I stay there, angry for hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I want to look at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will descend like a classic and then you will expect the same things and you will receive from time to time the average amount of garbage they have. The only moment in the whole show that destroyed me was when HBK came out !!!! The moment HBK loses in front of JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. It almost destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me when she beat TRIPLE H! I could not look at WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I started to look at him again (fortunately). I'm again confident of WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was a pure classical Wrestlemania. She definitely did it for Mania 23 and gave us many memorable moments. If you watched any of Wrestlemanias before that, like those that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 has turned me into a fan), PLEASE do not look at this and make the same mistake that I made leave behind WWE. And if you follow him and you're upset, start watching him again and watch Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
