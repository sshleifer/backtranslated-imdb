Not as bad as you have heard. There are actually some funny parts, and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is appealing and pleasant as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are perfect professionals. They're pretty good in almost everything. Eventually, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday film you'll ever see. Unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. Attempts to dark humor are as loud. Affleck hardly tries to be enormously spasmous and overerent, but it happens to be disturbed. Caricature character of his character is brought to a height when looked at by the more hidden and more credible performances of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even after the relaxed holiday film standards, never fully purchase the Affleck "rented" set for this X-mas family. There are also scenes that surround the surreal in their oddity. X-mas eve scene is filled with incestuous humor (a discovered son staring at naked, provocative pictures of his mother), which is not only not funny or credible but disturbing. To make things worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost scruffy. The house where most of the film is being made seems expensive and inexpensive. "Survival" is mostly interesting as the fourth in a box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this for Affleck.) It remains to be seen how long the damage will last.
