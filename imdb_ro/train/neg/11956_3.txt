This movie smells. I do not think I've ever seen a movie so tight on the value of the shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the act was bland. It could have been a good movie. I think it was just based on the visual grotesque. Usually they can handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but Miike seemed to shoot her for the sake of filming. Just a badly executed movie. There is simply nothing to have fun watching this movie if you are not fascinated to exhaust yourself with explicit incidents of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, auto-milking, parental abuse and brotherhood, and fecal dispersal. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I wanted to say that when I said that. He has succeeded in other films, but I think it would be better to look at someone to drink.
