Not even the most fanciful fan could have liked the movie, (I am one of them), the monks are not given any work material. It's just a shame, because this is the only feature they've done with Curly, and this effort is painfully unstoppable when it could have had great potential. Gorgeous musical numbers do not help anybody. The shortcuts they have made with the same title are more laughing.
