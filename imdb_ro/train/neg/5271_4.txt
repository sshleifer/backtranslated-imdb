An American family, wandering in the west, discovers a strange fantastic city in the middle of the desert. I know little that this phantom city once was a nuclear bomb test site and that a dead presence follows them. Generally, I love mystery and horror movies like this. Cube, Spielberg's "Duel" and "Birds" are all the wonderful examples of movies that give no response, but leave us intrigued and we want more. Apparently, writer / director "Disappearance" Walter Klenhard is trying to make only this type of film and whether he has succeeded or not on the part of the viewer. I personally think it's about half way, then the movie sank. The actors are all kinds of "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad, but we, as public, never feel the fear and react to unrealistic situations. Is someone absolutely sick of just walking characters to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them some kind of justification to do it!?!?! <br /> <br /> As for movies made for television, go to an over average balance, for sure. The Klenhard Director should be praised for the milieu of the desert for everything he offered and some of the settings were striking. There is a very cool scene in which two characters find an old nuclear test ground, because the sand has been completely melted on the glass to the eye. I wonder if this was real? No gore to talk about, and the "creatures" or what the hell is that after these people? I'm never shown, let alone never give us any real clue about what they are (Indian mutants, aliens, ghosts or Indian Indian spirits, oh that narrow for us!) Or where they come from. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of clich√©s here as well. Why is it that the cities of these types of movies are always really, really stupid? Why is there always an old man who thinks he is crazy, who turns out to be right? Why? Why? Why? How is a new scenario happening, folks! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" tries to be different and clever, but ultimately fails to be too familiar with new direct-video horror fans in many ways. Hey, I've seen much worse movies, and disappearance is not bad, is it just too? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
