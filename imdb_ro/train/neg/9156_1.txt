Ben & Arthur COULD were 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, watched and produced this movie. Sam should have given the idea of ​​a good writer, director, and left the act in front of someone who could act. this is a good example of a person who controls the entire production. there was no one to say, "Sam is bad, very bad." Jamie Brett Gabel's actor was the only good point, but he could have been much better with a good director and better actors to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). the act and the direction were so bad, the film was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh at the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point ... this would make a great movie. after the first two minutes you give up watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
