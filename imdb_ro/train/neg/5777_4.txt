It's funny when you stop and think about it: fans of the horror movie tend to have a profound and persistent affection for those who scare the daylight from them. Texas CHAINSAW MASCAR can give us nightmares, but who among us did not feel a real madness of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or for Ken Foree, forever and always the determined hero of the original DAWN OF MORTAL? His way in the remake made me want to get up and tell him (as in the case of Tom Savini); I'm not kidding. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you let me go (if not, it's just in the wind ...). These are some of the horror heroes. To see that many of them have gathered in a single movie are almost unheard of (at least in this sense, to my knowledge). If only the author (s) would have reached such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as there is no half-hearted effort (such as BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD, for example).
