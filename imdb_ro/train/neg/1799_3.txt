Skippy from "family ties" plays Eddie, a "metallic" nerd who dresses. When his favorite "metal" singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a pit that tears all the posters on the bedroom wall. But when later he has an unlimited record that holds the spirit of his "metallic" idol dead. First he sucks on revenge ideas, but then he does not want to take it as Sammi does. Which is not that far, that its main victims seem to go to the hospital. This movie is extremely ridiculous and has just as much to do with real metal as it is called "Rock Star". Okay, maybe a little more than junk, but you give me a point. And how someone can root for a guy Skippy has from "family ties" I have no idea. Theme cameo by Gene Simmons is OK and Ozzy Osbourne gets coherent, I applaud him for it, but I will ignore it. <br /> <br /> My Class: D Candy Eye: Elise Richards gets topless, a topless supplement at a pool party
