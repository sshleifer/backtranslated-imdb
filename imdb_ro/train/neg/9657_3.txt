1) I am not an expert in weapons, but I really see the difference between the US Army riffs during the First and Second World Wars. In the movies we can see privately, armed with the "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), which uses its use until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can charge 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires reloading after each shot. A little difference ?! 2) The German Army uniforms have lent since 1940 and the Year. Especially - headphones. German helmets by the end of World War I have a significant pike on the top, we can not see anyone in the movie. And if we do some extra search in the archives - how true is this "True Story"? I am surprised how "true" film directors can be in pursuit of cheap propagation.
