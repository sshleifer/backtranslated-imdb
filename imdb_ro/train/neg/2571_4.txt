With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you think it will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a horrible rash. The film is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly wakes up in a relationship with a really strange young man not to mention the attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly disconnected and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this film does not prove it. <br /> <br /> This song about ?? Arabella Cinderella is pretty cold, but that's it. I only recommend this movie to people who want to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. I think this movie more than anything else is a sign of times, in terms of well-defined experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and writing, not to mention the direction is just so there . <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers, in particular, is very hit and miss, he will go from Dr. Strangelove and be there along his career, to filthy movies like this and the Christian Magic who was very similar to it in context and style, but the movie had some fun moments. This is meaningless and I'm sad that someone as big as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
