After 30 seconds, you already realize that there is no real budget for this cheap thing. The story is taken from great movies such as "Texas Chain Massacre" and "Hills Have Eyes". I like those movies, even if they are duplicated well (Tower Wrong, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But Side Sho is hard to watch: the actors are very bad, the dialogue is cheesy, and the music is bad and totally wrong. You do not care what happens to the characters. The so-called wicked are not at all interesting and rather stereotyped. And how about blood and gore? Well, there are some, though it's pretty cheap and the action is done very badly. 2 Points, just for gore and blood, but I understand that this is hard to look for, even for gore-hounds.
