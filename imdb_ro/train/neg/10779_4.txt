I found this film as a total disappointment. The talents of the director - especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (not even mentioning the four main causes) - have been completely wasted on an unfortunate and mediocre story, it cares for once inserted into stereo, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is powerless, Zeta-Jones is simply annoying (appearing to take her role from fidelity, less humor), Crystal just plays the same old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter-ego, and Cusack simply goes by his side, apparently bored with the whole project. For what is supposed to be a "romantic comedy," there is absolutely no romance among the central characters, not to mention chemistry, and the comedy - SPOILERS), the only moments of mild humor came out of the role of Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the screenwriter is obviously incapable of showing any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was quite funny because the Mexican lover and Walken made a very funny tower like a Dogme-like director-but these parts represented very little time on the screen and instead (Spoilers) I was treated with Billy Crystal being swallowed by a dog. The pure genius. For a great fan of most of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic pieces, I was completely disappointed with a movie with lots of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or develop any instead of resorting to the same old-style clips and even descending into the depths of almost "thick, teen-film" humor. <br /> <br /> A very weak 4/10.
