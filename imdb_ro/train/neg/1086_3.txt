Despite his impressively cast and pedigree crew Gingerbread Man collapses early and often. The plot is unrealistically convoluted, the accents of bad actors and the participation of director Robert Altman means collecting a paid check. Once again, he gathered an impressive distribution (like Woody Allen, everyone wishes to work with Altman), that this time around the letter is miscast. But that's just part of the problem. Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a powerful Georgia lawyer who, in the opening stages of the film, manages to seduce absurdly a mysterious waitress who persuades her is in serious danger from a former husband and a stammering father. With red flags everywhere, the harsh lawyer complains, even managing to make his children feel bad. Combat weapons and punch follow along with a tracking machine and, if it is not enough, there is a hurricane thrown into the ridiculous finale. Branagh plays MacGruder with a southern and unconvincing accent. Running around a ditch, all the time, is blind to keep the story. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as a P.I. but with less emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as old is Boo Radely all grew more annoying than a bed bug serving thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible. Female directors (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are weak and lacking in spirit. Even villain-law celebrities (Vernon Jordan) are wooden, with few throws of lines. In addition to not paying too much attention to his actors, Altman's witness, who splashed with spanish, unformed muscles, comic book cards. He does not miss his touches and observations (he informs the viewer that the stars and bars continue to circulate in Georgia), which makes Altman so well done. Unfortunately, the man with sweet ginger is Altman at worst, even if the salary is the same.
