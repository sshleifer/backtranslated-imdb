can any movie become more naive than this one? can not believe a piece of this scenario. and its predictable ssooooo that you can tell the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. the top actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she does not, the doll has more acting skills). the ease that the character passes and remains in a music school makes the ghost from the opera novel seem to be a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but the only good thing about the film is Madsen's performance that manages to bring the life of a one-dimensional character. sticks to teeth. I can believe Britney's 13-year-old girl shouting, "Oh, give us a break! If we want to make fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm book is always hidden somewhere in the attic." I gave her 2 instead of one for Virginia Madsen.
