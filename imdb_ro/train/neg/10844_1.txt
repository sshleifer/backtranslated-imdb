Unfortunately, this film is not "the best British film from Gall", although the DVD covers this, which has deceived me to buy it. It is, however, a tribute to many of the great horrors of old films, from the most notable Amicus flag. Cradle ... is shot on your mini, who, although we all know that he has more than one TV feel than a movie, can do much better. Each scene, set and shot looks like it was lit in the same way (standard key, fill, rear setting), which only improves the cheap look of the finished piece. Gore content is, frankly, ridiculous. From the opening fires, where we see the foam head, obviously torn apart, to the cheap knives, the creature and the terrible cr, there is nothing to impress me at all. The act is abominable, from the detective close to the coma to the dwarf dwarf, through Dani Filth, the least convincing horror film I've ever seen. Each of the substors is more formal than the latter, and the sets get worse and worsen as the movie runs. Watch out for the "Asylum Mental" - a semi-detached Georgian house with a cg bad sign outside and the most bizarre (and not to a large extent) lined cell that I have seen. four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (not running) to any available opportunity. In fact, I found myself dusty at some point while the movie was being broadcast. However, it marks one of Emily Booth's latest known appearances, which I think is one (um, two) things she's doing for that. Once it's out of the way, it's all down. I hear people say good things about Alex Chandon and I would like to believe them, but on the basis of this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and go to the League of Special Gentlemen in return. <br /> <br /> At the moment fighting him with Blair Witch 2: The Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I've ever seen.
