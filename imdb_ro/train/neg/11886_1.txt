Watching Josh Kornbluth's act in this movie reminds me of my first-generation TV production class, where "not funny" had the chance to prove how unhappy they really were! OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when trying to synopsize this wannabe comedy. Banknotes are sophomoric and telegraphic. Delivery is painful. Ouch !!!!!!! Writing is simply tough. It is like a show by Bob Saget. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is just as painful as watching a half-hour and half-hour-long summer rain (Belushi station). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I want my money back!
