This movie is classified as a classic on the feeling not on any quality of the movie. It moves from the least probable to the incredible, from the unrealistic to the absurd. The incredible plot is spinning around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu Hindu to save a third soldier captured by the insurgent Indians. In the later scene, we see a complete revolver and bloody regiment battling in an ambush. In the British Army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you walk over it, he will not try it with another soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly ineffective that they are ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not hold their prisoners or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing stone blocks down from insurgent cemeteries scattered around the mountain in ambush ... they should have an eggplant for a brain to believe that it would do any harm. After Cary Grant was shot, the prisoner was shot, he was on the floor looking around the boy with water ... hardly the actions of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy courageously blows a buzz (coming from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... this is done by raising up a wall so that he can be seen and shot by the bad guys and shed a tear which keeps trying to ring more notes, being shot repeatedly, and the call rolls up in some strange ... instead of blowing the lair hiding behind the cover, as someone would do with half a brain. This scene was rightly parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a comedy Buster Keaton, they would have to hire Keaton and do it better.
