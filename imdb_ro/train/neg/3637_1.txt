I am amazed at the positive reviews for this uninspired movie. Often with foreign movies, I skip reviews that complain about the slow and seemingly "lack of action," because many of the best international films do not live up to West Hollywood's movie stories. I enjoy the art and the absence of clich√© in the arena of the foreign film. I like that many foreign movies do not connect things in a small, pleasant, tasty bow. That being said, this film did not offer any ransom value for the time we lost looking at it. No significant character development, no exciting story arc, no emotional involvement with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A bunch of immobile emotionally supported colonies are hurt by their slaves and a little girl is hurt by her only friend when the "house boy" gets sick and abuses her. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraph is painful and dramatic, this movie will bore you while playing the script. I was so unconnected that it took three sessions to finish, and I would not even have done it for positive evaluations. <br /> <br /> If you do not have an academic interest during this time, we suggest that you focus on this aspect.
