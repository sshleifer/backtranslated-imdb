Let me make a short summer of the movie: A dumb, rude child called Max, is hindering a radio that contains Kazaam: a cute. Like all geniuses, he gives 3 desires, but, being good, he helps Max make his personal life because he has to deal with aggressors and a father mixed up in organized crime. During all of this, Kazaam raps from time to time, (also presenting Shaq poor rap skills). This film proves what we all know: sportsmen have to stay in the sport. I admit it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but all about this movie loss is horrible. The characters are either steadfast or stupid, the plot is not worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would be a joke. I know the film just attracted the fact that ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (he did not mean to say) at that moment. Frankly, I can not think of one positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have put the time he used to make this film for free throws.
