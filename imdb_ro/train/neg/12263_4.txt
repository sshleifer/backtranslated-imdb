Seeing this movie, as I did for the first time on Turner Classic (describing it as "Dangerous Female"), it can multiply your appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez must have been hated. I hope he remembered his dentist and the seller of Brylcreem in his will; made him the actor he was. Women are good, but not better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting is the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently offers many of the elements of individual tics, but almost nothing in the atmosphere of changing their successors in roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor have somehow surpassed the essential eminence of their characters in remake; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even smelly; is there as a big slice of ham. Its main value today is a reminder that wonderful movies such as "Falcon Falcon" are not just happening. On a scale of 1 to 10 am a rate of 4, mainly for camera work and support players.
