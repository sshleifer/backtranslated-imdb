This fearful and offensive movie made me intrigued from the beginning. The characters are the normally missing young masters who often see themselves hanging in a side by side sea. Robert is an outsider but has the music that could have been his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert become a freak who embarks on a trip to cannabis and ecstasy and meets the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in the "madness of the cold," and Robert ends the film as a humanitarian rapist. He wonders how much experience this young director has in real life. No one can save the poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British are out of control. There is a very hopeless relationship with the Iraqi insurgents; During unnecessary graphic rape we are subject to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of the male age group pushed to its limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's ugly image of the modern man. Clay implies that people simply can not help causing terrible acts of violence. It is a miracle that the British film industry allows money to be invested in films that support such a divisive propaganda, when in London we are still strayed by recent attacks. This is Clay's first movie, I'd be delighted if it's his last film.
