This movie is terrible. Not offensive but highly predictable. The film follows the life of a family of small towns in the mid-1960s. The father, the school principal, is going through a middle crisis. Enter a cute teacher from the big city that begins to provoke the minds of his students with some challenging thoughts, such as thinking yourself. The principal disagrees with her teachings, but she is beautiful. You can connect the points. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the lifestyle of the little town and wants to live. She has a bad tip, she stands up with some bad guys and it seems that family planning was not taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has worked mainly on television, this film plays as a more adult version of a post-school special event or a very special episode of one of the brightest sitcoms.
