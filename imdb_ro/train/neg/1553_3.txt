This film really deserves the MST3K treatment. A pseudo-antic fantasy hack-n-slash story with twin barbarian brothers with a collective hot water IQ, names that appear to have been derived from a Mad Libs book and such classic lines as "Keep it Down and discover her belly! "Barbarians cross the territory" so bad, it's good ".
