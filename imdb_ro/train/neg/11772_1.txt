I'll be short ... This movie is a hurt for everyone, except for his cinema. The mere fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems to be valid until we are "treated" in a persistent dance scene. The plan is not ridiculous to anybody, except for the hottest fan of BAD, will pull something out of it. And for the love of God, please stop saying that this movie is a story of lost innocence or even the empowerment of women, because it is quite clear (childish lesbians, what the hell?). this was the worst film from the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even collapsed in the middle of the movie, probably because they could not take it anymore. this may seem a criticism too critical, but I really can not find a redeeming feature of this movie, except maybe, if you consider it pure comedy. In short, this film is best watched on a class A drug cocktail.
