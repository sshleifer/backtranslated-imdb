This was a new low alltime among Westerners. Writing is wrong, characters are impossible to accentuate and are either disgusting or gentle, violence is terrible and technically executed, not very convincing. And Tobey Maguire shows us his talents in sleepwalking on his side with those expressionless eyes and the voice of his voice that betrays manners only here. "Ride With The Devil" is among the first five worst cinematic experiences, ever a Western that will not be overcome in the negative.
