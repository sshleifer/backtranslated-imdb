My title should be enough. I doubt that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would make such a movement as the "new vague" kinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and intelligent philosophy. But when they hand them a camera that starts playing like WOOOHOOO LOOK How strange it can be! PLOT? THEME? Phew! LET'S FILM A BEAUTIFUL RIDE SPEED PARK & ROUND! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the heads of people. Oh-la-la, quel artiste). No, Truffaut keeps a degree of visual clarity. But the security room is just as fast. The two are indisputable. Haha, as much as above all of your film school companions: I bet the vein pulls out your throat right now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence my comment. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, it hates you. People who love the movie probably never read any books other than jack Kerouac's robberies or "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." Or maybe they have read the lyrics of The Doors, and they think it's moving. No matter what the boat is floating. It seems to me ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the best and most important writers who have ever lived. Nice trial, truffles. But you are nowhere near the ticket park. Avoid this film as an infected syringe with a help. If you are the type of person who wants to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). If you're an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And push the name of God, which vein back into the throat. You look like a cabbage.
