I tracked this on the tube last night. The actor involved first caught my eye. The first scenes were the recipients of attention. Some funny some sad. Developing good characters. I felt that the third third of the film went away. If it was not for the beginning of the movie, I would have stopped looking. I continued to look at how I wanted to see how they tie together. Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. In particular, I did not like the prolongation period that many characters speak Yiddish (?). Was that other shoe? Would I recommend you? No, I do not think so. As other reviewers mention, much of the slogan is dated (the 1960s), but it was not too distracting. The end stopped me completely.
