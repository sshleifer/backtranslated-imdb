Well, this movie started funny but quickly damaged. I thought it would be more adult-oriented humor, based on the first moments, but then the movie turned into a bad way for Disney Channel, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a fake Italian accent. The movie seemed and sounded very independently and with a low budget. It was a very nice time that I would call the serenand scene, but in general, it was a married one. The ladies are very few and among them. The ultimate surprise for Mr. Fix It is so ridiculous that he left me crazy than anything else. It can be a good idea if you can catch it for free or TV, but do not miss the money you bought or rent this movie.
