I have to tell you right in front, I'm certainly not an authority in Bollywood movies and I just saw one hand. However, if you have never seen it, DO NOT start with this! I was very happy with what I've seen so far, but I could not stand it. I also have to tell you that I could not finish this movie - it was annoying. Why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called "Rambha" in the movie. He's even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never have thought possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it was supposed to be a comic amusement. Instead, he laughed at me and wanted to die ... slowly! His voice, his manners and his inconvenience - he did not seem to be silent and dominate every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. Heroes had the amazing ability to easily avoid the AK-47 bullets. I did not undress you - there was a scene where some unarmed boys took a small army of boys with these assault rifles! And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet and beat the burgers! This has made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" to look mundane !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so loud, loud, in front of you and intense - practically made my blood! It was as if the film had been made by people under the influence of metals! Camera angles, music and action INTENSE, action, action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who can not take a plot movie and wants an almost 100% action. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made no sense ... none! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you are the brightest act and Bollywood fan you can support this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, I can see why it's on the infamous list of IMDb Bottom 100. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad!
