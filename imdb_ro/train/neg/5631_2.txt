The picture on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen died. I think we've lost half the movie. However, it was poorly accomplished and not interesting. I have not found the story about the title "Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I did not get involved enough to take care of the first few cadres. I hired the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and it was sad that he was losing his talent. I do not think that Giada Colagrande studied the film making enough time to develop an important film. She is attractive and could become an actor but has taken too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they do not have chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters were even entered into the plot.
