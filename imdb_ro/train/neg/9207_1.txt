This movie was sold for a dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel that I lost anything to watch this movie, except for my TIME. He enjoyed the act of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and gave a remarkable performance considering it was a horrible scenario. The story is about students who have decided to play the Mazes & Monsters game just in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past by playing this game with other colleagues and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a beautiful woman and has a romantic story with her and, once she starts playing the game, she does not make love to her and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the movie that are taken running around the former World Trade Center and also in the observation and roof area. It is rather sad to look at this part of the movie in which so many human beings have died because of the evil in the world. This is not a very good film, except that Tom Hanks is trying to keep the movie above the level of immersive entertainment.
