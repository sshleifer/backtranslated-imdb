Increasingly, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but I was really cold of this movie. For the better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a simple documentary "Behind the Music". Rather, it is a biographical, full of interviews, performance images, home movies and, above all, unnecessary animation sketches from Animal Farm. The film is coherent, but it's about half an hour longer. The format of the camp, while touching in thought, is actually quite annoying in execution. First, without titles, it is hard to know even half of these interviewees. Second, who really needs to hear people such as Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack in the head of his mouth licking hosannas about a man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life, and their opinions add nothing to his story. This image is best when Strummer, through interviews and recorded conversations, reaches the facets of life that most people did not know about: the suicide of his elder brother, who was approaching the deaths of his parents, the joy of paternity. For me, they moved a lot because they showed Joe Strummer not as a painting we all knew and loved, but as a common human being who had to deal with the joys and pains of life with which we must all confront. br /> There were better and clearer documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and the MTV documentary narrated by Kurt Loder in the early 90's). Joe Strummer: The future is uncomfortable, it's just for the dead.
