There are bad movies, terrible movies even boring movies ... I can see the most and put it to the end, not this time. Avoid this such as plague, annoying music, terrible editing, comedy, shot but a cup of novelty ... Missus wanted me to look at this by thinking that it would be a blond legal or something visibly legal , but never better than average, romantic teenage film. She was the first time she begged me to push the stop button. Girls, well, were not great to start with (Denise did OK in Troopers Starship and wild things), but you sank your gravel. I feel like a mound that spent 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after many construction works on her face. Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting your valuable oxygen and brain cells by running to the best basket on the screen.
