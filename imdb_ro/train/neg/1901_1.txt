This review may also contain some spoilers. The remake of the 1974 classic car tracking movie went in 60 seconds. In fact, it is well acting and the plot moves pretty well. But even a great Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original story was more credible. For those who do not know, the initial plot made the thieves work as insurance inspectors. Who's gonna suspect them. But even with a change to almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original remake is a great movie until we get to the final stage of the chase, part of the 74th version that made her wonderful. The one in this version is watered down, just 10 minutes, and culminates with a special monster effect that takes all credibility from pursuit. If the original chase was very credible, the star was a stunt pilot who did all his own stunt, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car tracking movie, fine your original in the rental basket at your local rental location and do not leave your new remake.
