Being a great fan of Corman's horror films, I was expecting him a little more than I received from the West. I was having a good time. I was almost as laughing as I watched Mel Brooks's thriving villages. See the showcase of the rolling trolley tracks on the old west prefecture. You can kill time by counting them if an otherwise boring scene happens. And horses seem to have tools as well, considering that they are following fast. See also the queen of rockers in the Western Wild West Salon that makes a number that reminds of a certain fashion dance from the 1920s, here decades before the style was invented. I hope the salon around them will not sink. In the midst of this chaos, the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really beautiful. A special praise for them that they did everything they could with the material that seems to have been the most from Johnny Guitar but does not impress in the same way. But there is nothing wrong with a western cheer like this one. Like a terrible horror film, it may not succeed in some way, but it does succeed in anyway to enjoy it. That's one reason why Corman's call is calling me, so I dare recommend that you experiment with this movie if you have the chance.
