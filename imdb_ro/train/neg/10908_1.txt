Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought the premise, giving a man a libido of a ram, was interesting and should offer some laughter. WRONG! It's not just funny about the movie. For example, the main character who makes a passage to a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it is limited to obscenity. They feed on bestiality in this film on a single level and is not fun at all. We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character that does this altogether, everywhere, every time is also not funny. It becomes a cliche. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I think, acceptable in the role. By doing this, I mean he is not a bad actor, but with rotten materials it is difficult to commend quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of OAMAN-Romantic leadership (does not count the number of animals that the main character is interested in as a romantic?), Seems to be embarrassed, it should also be. It seems to work in some kind of vacuum, detached from all the other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> See this movie only if you want to get bored with the tasty, boring, repetitive material.
