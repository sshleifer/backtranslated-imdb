This movie seems to send a wrong message. It can be a morality without using Christ. The poet of other religions, I believe, can get to heaven. I am a Catholic going to church every week but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance. This is the worst travel film I've ever seen and I've seen it on Timeline.
