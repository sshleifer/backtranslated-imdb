I was totally dissatisfied with the comments that said it was a good movie. This is a complete SUCKED movie. That is, SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. Developing the story is weird. Mia Kirshner has changed from an innocent girl to a fun party looking for chicken without convincing motives. In addition, all actresses seemed too old to be students - college students showed that about 30 years ago - you realize the rest. I only looked in the first ten minutes and started to redirect quickly to look for sexual scenes. all sexual scenes are bloody, hasty and, most importantly, not frontal. All sexual scenes are ridiculous, considering how many clothes they have. Do a favor - put it down and save a few dollars. Conclusion: Story - 0, Sex - 0, Actor - 0, Score - 0 out 10.
