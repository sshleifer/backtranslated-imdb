This movie is not just a movie very bad actors terrible - or alleged actors - way bored and story unappealing copy exactly a scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso," directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (with two years before), one of the most famous philosophers in Italian cinema and a cult movie all over the world. In "La Sanguinusa leads to danza", the director resumed the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with a view from a bedroom window. Of course, the script in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the delicious and charming in Martino's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another who has resurrected the scene is simply the best way to prove that Rizzo's movie has no ideas, originality, taste and nothing. I think such things are an offense to the spectator.
