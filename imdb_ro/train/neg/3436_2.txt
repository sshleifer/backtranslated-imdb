A girl blows up that she does not know that a serial rapist looks at her through the skylight. Detectives Martin Manners and Orville Stone light up in his footsteps, but not quite hot as they find him after killing, rape and eating a face nipple. He's shot to death. It would hope that this would be the end of the movie. Not because it's too horrible, but because the level of action is atrociously horrible. Unfortunately, it is not the end, and months later the violator is resurrected as a zombie of a covenant of Satanists. So he continues where he left, with the detectives again, this time and a flying child follows him (do not ask). There were very good films of small size (Trash Street and Filthy McNasty Spring), but this is the scraper of the cylinder bottom. Something awful, courageous, with special store effects, a lame comedy test, and oh yes, and the end is deceptive. <br /> <br /> My class: B Candes Eye: Theresa Best becomes completely nude; Anne R.
