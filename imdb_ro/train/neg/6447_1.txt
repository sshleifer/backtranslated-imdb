I bought this movie for $ 5 in a shopping cart at my local video store for just one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have pulled the five, tossed it into a toilet, they washed. The film is about a bunch of twenty years old who have reached the climax in high school and gathered on the anniversary of the death of their idiotic friends who got drunk and wandered in the woods and died. The problem is that a reptilian monster hunts them one by one. The actor is dizzy, these worthless people were apparently desperate on shows such as 90210 and Dawsons Creek. Directing was twelve years old and the script was probably done at the age of thirteen. The whole set looks like a courtyard of someone in Malibu. The people who appreciated this movie are obvious friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this garbage at all costs.
