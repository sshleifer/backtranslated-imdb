This is not a very bad start for the program - but what a slap in front of a real law enforcement action. The worst part of the series is that it is trying to billable as a real fare - and it's nothing but. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve more than that. What's next, medical school in a minute? Charo realizes lipo? Charles Grodin assisting to replace his hip? Hi ... looks a little respect. Even Muncie citizens came out of the program as if they were on stage. Police Academy = School Gymnasium? Poor editing (how many times can I use the image from the car to the Taco Bell in the background?) Cheerful siren effects (the same loop adds ad nauseum to every "call" if the rolling code or not), and last but not the last row - more matters related to the officers' safety than you could shake a stick. If I want to see the work of cops and false cops, I'd look at RENO 911.
