Ronald Reagan and a bunch of American soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We teach North Korean Communists are bad people ... We learn that American men grow very slowly in torture days ... We tried to suppress it, but finally I broke out laughing at this movie. It was the scene in which Mr. Reagan comes out of telling the Communists he wants to be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, acting coldly, take a drunk fellow, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is just as stupid as they are. So the drink distracts the guard as Reagan goes to get something out of a drawer that's next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes should contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them shake enough to show they're naked. I have to laugh! I think the "Prisoner of War" will appeal primarily to the family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it is wasteful.
