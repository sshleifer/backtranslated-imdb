For the most part, this film resembles a "made for television" effort. Direction is ham-fisted, the act (except for Fred Gwynne) is overloaded and soap. Denise Crosby, in particular, offers his lines as if it were cold to read them from a cue card. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching, and that's when Gage comes back from "Meaning." There is something disturbing to watch a little baby killing someone and this movie could be more than some can cope just for this reason. It's absolutely cooling the bones. This movie has only one good thing, but it's just one thing right in the park. It's worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.
