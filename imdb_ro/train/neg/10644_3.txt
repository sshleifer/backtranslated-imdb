Well, here we have another film to revert the role. Despite the tired object of gender reversal, there were many useful things. However, it is not. In previous reviews, I think I have referred to the general decline in pleasure for the Haim films that followed the late 80's. This is one of them. Only one of the girls is about a high school kid (Corey Haim) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and taking part in another school. She joins the cheerleading team and joins her friends with the cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not keep up with it for a long time. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was completely bad and it was not funny. But judging by most reviews, it seems that Alanis Morrisette's fans or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who would like to look at it. If you are looking for a good feature of Haim (or a role-change comedy), look no further than 1989. It's about the point where Haim's career was dancing.
