I can not think too much about this movie. This was a terrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to see it. He had so few redemptive qualities that I do not even know where to start. The land moved from implausible to absolutely absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the movie, because I could not wait for terrible things to end and be done. By the end of the movie, I felt beyond ease. <br /> <br /> Editing was poor, the act was sub-par, and the story was weak. Francoise Robinson was interpreted as a native American, even if he does not look very much like someone from the native American heritage. <br /> <br /> If a movie is going to be this idiot, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. It was not. It was just pathetic.
