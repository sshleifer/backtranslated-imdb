Murder by Numbers is one of those movies you expect to do for television, but it is not. Considering that the only actor of any note is Bullock (though Michael Pitt seems to move on to bigger and better things), it's no surprise that this movie fades quickly from memory to be replaced by more important things. As if remembering to close your front door when you get out. Or put your clothes back when you get out of the shower. Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a policeman with personal problems (not all). Together with her new partner, Ben Chaplin, she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that the two are teenagers who think they planned and executed the perfect crime. As the investigation continues, a battle between Cassie and the main suspect, Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling), is being created. The criminal problem here is that the two leaders are hopeless. Bullock, though very pleased to look at her, is equally credible in the role of a cynical policeman like Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, it would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity, and I'm sorry he has to put this film on his CV in an attempt to enter Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, as misleading suspicious suspects, are adequately paid. As if the gifted leaders were not bad enough, a story that would send someone to sleep and an extremely predictable (but illogical) end to shoot this film in the head before they had the chance to run. Murder by Numbers "has absolutely nothing for him, even a bullshit scene unnecessary by Bullock would not redeem. Well, just a little, but not enough to save it. Forgotten, predictable and redundant - this is a movie that will not Move the guy before ... As Cassie probably says in the next case, there's nothing to see here.
