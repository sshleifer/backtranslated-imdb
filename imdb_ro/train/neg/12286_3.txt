The summary provided by my cable guide made it much more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror film I've ever seen, a title previously owned by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From the opening scene I could say it would be very bad, but I was so bored I would not care less. This movie contains frightening actors, especially the guy who has been tormented in his dreams, incredible as unwanted plot overturns and some of the most crappiest music I've ever heard and live at a time when Britney Spears and Nsync dominate air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. One would be an equally boring and boring film, and so NOT scary, as this would try to refresh its stuff a little with some fun hooks here and there, but not. We have Tormented Guy's self-taught boyfriend trying to be funny, but he's been annoying about him. (spoiler) And please tell me, who in this crazy world is crazy and unbearable to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night? No one! If you want to make a horror movie, make it at least credible. This is something else.
