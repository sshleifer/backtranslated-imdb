I do not know what Donald Sutherland's acting style or voice style is, but he's always acting behind a massive Kleenex knock. Just ... I do not know, rude? Lunatic? On drugs? Strange. That said, I saw the movie again for the first time since its initial release, and honestly, I do not remember that something like that ends. A bad end, too, because nothing is bound. What about the dead husband? The annoying child (and was the baby called?)? Scotland Yard and the military pursuers? I would have liked to pack things and give a dramatic shutdown for everything, not just for a great panorama. And what woman sleeps with the man she knows killed her husband? Even if he tried to destroy Needle's suspicions to protect his baby, he could have always had a headache. This last encounter made me feel too nagging and uncomfortable ...
