WOW! That's pretty terrible. The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor route arrives in Sardinia and merges with artistic director Joseph Losey for this remarkably badly designed Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who holds her fortress on an island, where she dictates her memories to an incredibly patient secretary. When bastard Burton shows up pretending to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes his time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme - it's hard to see if Taylor and Burton act badly, or if Williams's intention is to make their characters so hard. If this is the case then the act is brilliant! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screaming. It's terrible. Noel Coward is also Taylor's tattoo, "Capri's Witch". <br /> <br /> Probably the BOOM is about how long the passer is and how fast life moves - two Williams standard issues, but it's so wrong with Losey that Taylor and Burton did not have it casting for audiences their monologues with the greatest importance, any substance the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has a stunning photo --- the camera should have been out of focus to screw the beauty of Sardinia! The supporters who support Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli, as inventor of Taylor and Michael Dunn as a dwarf guard ... both he and his dogs make a number on Burton!
