I watched this movie at 3 o'clock in the morning, an hour on the day when I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. But I still think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons for that are many. The actress is not all that good, and from time to time the situations that appeared in her reminded me of a 90-year-old comedy by Chevy Chase. I mean, come on, like the situation of handcuffs and the situation of poker among the serv ... This movie was so obviously very much based on the first, and that's okay. But if I had not seen her first before seeing this, she would be more upset. Like the end, it came very suddenly and I felt like I did not close what happened ... Sebastian changed very suddenly and this movie seems to have been done just to explain the number 1 and that no one time or effort has not been used to do anything else good. The score is the same as the first one and does not feel like a movie at all ... She would have had to deal with situations with more style and class, but they did not, and that movie was bad. ..
