The movie looks great on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic of cross-gold, especially with this excellent romance distribution. I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan gives the two stars too much, but they just went and closed themselves. Adam Brooks's script might be to blame, but you'd better expect Kevin Kline from A Fish called Wanda. Instead, the two ping-pongs on each other and the rather unlikely growing story are never satisfactorily reconciled with the reason why any of them are in and struggling around France. Jean Reno works amiably as a policeman heart and I think he wants to be a star-to-side. You think he continued to make those remakes of Pink Panther (s!) So he was probably OK with ... 3/10
