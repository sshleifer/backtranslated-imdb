I just watched this movie on Starz. Allow me to go through some things that I thought could have been improved; acting, writing, directing, special effects, room crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed like the writers had no idea of ​​anything about the film. It seems that in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super-stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Now these things cost about 3 billion dollars and can not go invisible. It looks like you can fly from the US to the east of the middle in an hour. It was a completely random lesbian scene that I did not bother, but it seemed a tormented attempt to make more men see her. The camera will accidentally magnify the actors and move over random scenes. Yeah, from Steven Segal's movie, it's predictable like hell. On the whole, I'm snaking there on a plane.
