The non-existent field, tons of badly targeted / super chess scenes (Snipers / famous shields that can not reach their targets even a few meters away, plus what happens to the end?) - a bunch of law enforcement agents vandalizing the gallery WTH?), technical mistakes (how many bullets can fit in a 100+ glock magazine? These people shoot their weapons without the need to recharge). The movie is so bad that even a senior actor in Hollywood like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this junk. Do not watch this movie (I realized that I lost 100 good minutes of precious life on this subject). We hope the director will stop making movies or learn more about his next movie.
