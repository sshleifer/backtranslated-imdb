Carlo Verdone once managed to combine a superb comedy with intelligent and subtle social analysis and criticism. Then something happened and he turned into another boring director "more than you". Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summed up in one line "the working class = good and warm, while the upper class = snob and careless, but love finally wins ". a clich√© tricked for such a smart director. There is not much to talk about in the film. Each character is a walking stereotype: the self-mastered man who forgets his roots but who will become "good" again, the despised wife, a rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest but poor poet ... just on average. <br /> <br /> It is severely disappointing in every aspect.
