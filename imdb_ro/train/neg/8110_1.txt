I think Phillip Kaufman read the rock version of the Kundera novel and then started making this film. Okay, of course he will not have the fist of the original. Kundera's lyrics are wonderful due to the manipulation of the narrative concept, its ability to enter and exit the stories it builds. This movie does not even try! A dream sequence of Tereza, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is restored and makes no sense. Also, and this is probably a smaller point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks very much like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not a real complaint, but hey). A perfect example of other Hollywood literature.
