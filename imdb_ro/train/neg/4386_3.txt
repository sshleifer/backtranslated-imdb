with a title like this one, you can not expect a great movie. But this was very bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: a escaped killer wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's somebody else. this joke could work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the whole movie! actors are not so bad, but their characters are pretty bad and the story is boring and even stupid. No suspense, no enthusiasm and little gore (very cheap). Satan's little help attempts to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically. It has become so boring in the end that I actually stopped looking at 10 minutes before the end. I did not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but she came ... 13 years ago and did not do anything decent afterwards. So it's no wonder he had to sink as low as this piece of shit .. Avoid or be warned ..
