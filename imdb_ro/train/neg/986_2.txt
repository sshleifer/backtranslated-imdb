This movie had an IMDB of 8.1, so I expected much more of it. It starts funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the movie is halfway, it starts shooting and it all becomes hard to predict. The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we know them a little too well; they become cartoons, not real people at all. This is the same story I have seen hundreds of times, just here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialogue was not so outdated! The only thing that could be worse is whether the characters would have inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and, unfortunately, that was also the case with the Dead Letter. We hope this movie will soon end up in the Dead Movie Office.
