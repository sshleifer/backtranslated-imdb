Seeing a photo of a man attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could be up to the old tricks. Unfortunately, besides the close of a rotten corpse, it is unlikely to be recommended in this story about killing a rich man and searching for his daughter to figure out who killed him. None of the characters are appealing, and until you find out how they did (that twist was at least cold), stop your care. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than the Nightmare Concert!
