This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even though the boys deserve some of what they received ... the terrifying sadistic executions were "light" over the top. The only character who showed some consciousness at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could help with the sad plot. At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be a promise of a mediocre adventure, but it was just an effort to put the spectators into a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the film for me was if Jack Nicholson jumped from the bushes and shouted, "And where is the batman?" Kim Basinger could scream. <br /> <br /> Now it would have been cool!
