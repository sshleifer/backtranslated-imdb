Ronald Colman won the Oscar for Best Actor for the spectacular show as a popular theater drama that is completely lost in his roles, especially in the role of Othello of Shakespeare. Critically-praised movie George Cukor has a wonderful pedigree, written by Ruth Gordon's estimation team and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witchcraft banter comes here, and the backstage business is overstated. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has some beautiful moments in a difficult waitress (when Colman's theater addresses her soul, she asks, "What are you?" Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, surprisingly sweet and not very funny. * 1/2 from ****
