The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to start by throwing plausibility out of the window and continuing on that path for the rest of the process. RƒÅnarna is another great example of a movie that makes little sense. The banks in Stockholm are robbed of a band of highly efficient robbers in military style. Two police officers are beginning to investigate the case when it becomes soon more complicated than it would appear at first. As usual, in the Swedish film, the distribution is mostly made up of the same people you've seen many times. Mikael Persbrandt has to be in every Swedish movie in recent years! But it's OK, I think Persbrandt is one of the few who behave solidly here (as usual). The problems with this film are all about the story itself. First of all, robberies are mostly like a background. Rather, it is more a film about a young cop who is struggling to prove himself in a world of men (as has not been done a thousand times with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also an incredible plot of plot near the end, which seems as plausible as landing aliens. But still, I thought it was a pretty pretty touch, since I was almost half asleep then. She did things a little (and actually saved the evaluation from giving up another step). Finally, the main issue is the same thing as most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply that action and suspense does not meet the standards we are accustomed to other films of this genre (especially Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather faint in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish film-makers should try to focus more on plotting and action and forget about trying to "make the light of Hollywood action" as it is now. Because this is still an unforgettable effort from the Swedish film industry. I vote for it 3/10.
