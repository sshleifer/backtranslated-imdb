Michael Keaton's 1998 comedy of the same title has been condemned for special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George has prepared for this horror comedy, they are positively mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be made of polyamide, and his arms were like oversized oven gloves. They probably were. The film puts it thick in this parody of dozens of other films (much worse), and Paul Keith as a city doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
