I grew up with Scooby Doo all my life, my father grew up with scooby doo. I just watched the first episode of the transvestite, which is called Shaggy and Scooby, who have a clue. What planet are Warner Bros, letting this happen in the air. The characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my old 3-year-olds (who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! if someone, but Casey Kasem does not make Shaggy's voice, it just will not work! believe me. This program was shameful. What's new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format. Bin this piece of garbage and go back to the real Scooby
