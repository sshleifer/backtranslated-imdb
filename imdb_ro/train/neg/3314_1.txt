Reading through all these positive reviews find me confusing. How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a terrible adaptation of Jane Austen's second novel favorite? There are many issues with the movie, already mentioned in some reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits at the end of slaughter. While many characters are miscast - neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts it in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is Paltrow. I really enjoyed performing in certain roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, glued and completely detached from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not save this movie.
