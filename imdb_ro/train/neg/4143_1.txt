As I and the other half are big fans of garbage, we could not resist getting out of a movie that contained both the amateur and the excitement! However, for a 2004 movie with a cover from Freddy Vs Jason, this is a shame! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth a laugh if you can stand by it! The actor is terrible of the effects ... well I could do better with my video camera so bad that they just made efforts to put the makeup on the zombie girls and left my neck, hands, etc. It has no story, weird flashbacks that have no meaning and a terrible scenario! "You broke my tooth!" From a vampire "you broke my cigarette" was the man's answer that looked like Uncle Jessie of Dukes had passed with Santa!
