Hebrew newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when a hearing defendant whispers "Thank you" to the LL Cool J (as Rafe) testifying officer while leaving the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this movie, you are given the explanation. You will see Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov), Detective Partner Mr. Cool J, decide not to kill Damien Waynes (like Isaia Charles). Edison police officers are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and swallow their drug. No matter if he impresses his girlfriend (here called "Pussy") or wins a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does not fit well with Mr. Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption that reaches both unexpected scope and threat levels that threaten life. Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film above the water, but barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" raffle (also known as "rapper-actor" progress). Mister. McDermott is having fun with his role. Empowering gravitas in action supports actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (in the role of Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. "First Assault Assault" and "Tactical," but it's more important to know that Edison (Force) sees Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seem to have lost ). Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
