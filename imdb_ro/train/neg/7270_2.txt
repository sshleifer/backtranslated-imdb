I gave this movie "loooooooooooong" a "2" because of attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a speed reader, NEVER go through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speed speaking! And what the hell is going on in the plot if you can not read the subtitles. Endless views and naked eyes and constant rejection. Just boring after an hour or so. Some good cinemas, but some DARK think your screen was burned. How did she win something I will never understand. It's hard to talk about ACTING, as top actors seem to look and look with love to each other when they do not push each other. The character of Geraldo is so attractive that it is hard to believe that anyone will push him away. And what about his mother? I simply did not get it most of the time, except that there were three guys who seem to have had a history between them .... but they never figured out who it was whose "EX" .
