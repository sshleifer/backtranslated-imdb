I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when I checked IMDb after I saw it. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. Apparently it was a good movie at first, but when I got into surgery I could not believe how bad she got. This voice-over destroys everything! Imagine being cut off like this and listening to what he says. I saw the movie in German, so I do not really know what she said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, it does not hurt me ..." ... what is that? Speaking of "think about something else" and then forgetting your pain only if you think about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell is thinking about that? Someone comes to tell her, her son died during surgery (what she had to wait for). Besides, he found some letters in the Jessica Albas bag. plus that "she knows the hospital" ... and then takes her "a second" to figure out? What the hell '? And the end ... why the police busted them? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. This drunken doctor knows nothing else ... and then haunts them all, even their girlfriend ??? Why??? In spite of everything I think Christensen did a bad job, but that does not really matter to me ... those stupid mistakes and stupid things I have written about the above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... You just do not look at it;)
