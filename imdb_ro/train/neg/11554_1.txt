This film is a film embarrassment. I can not believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only was the scenario atrocious, but casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but beyond that ...% 99 of the rest cast ... ouch. Quite a lot anybody else ... wow is hard even to ... wow. Here is the number one rule about the comedy "DO NOT GO AWAY". There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can make drama and comedy - none of them were used in this movie. Canadian nepotism singer and casting directors help perpetuate bad film in Canada. I realize it's a "American" movie from a technical point of view, but look at the director, actors, location, etc. I have seen this on Bravo - they should be ashamed to have bought the rights to show this movie. Again, there are lots of great movies that can not get antenna time and show this shit.
