I was delighted to watch this movie, expecting it to be the sequel to the classic "Private Lessons" cult, which portrays the dream of a male adolescent. "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mention. It's just a basic Cinemax basic movie that will not change your life. There's just a hot sex scene in a roof, but that's all. I've been looking at this a long time ago, but believe me, it's just an ordinary, boring basic movie. Women are hot, but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to track this only if it is transmitted by cable.
