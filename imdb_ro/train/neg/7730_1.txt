Despite many style, flash and brilliance, this French music fails to speak. The songs are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is uninteresting, like many characters. <br /> <br /> People get into songs and dance without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wear false wigs and wigs, and the sets look closely at the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so a negative effect on me. Of course, a shame, to have such a multi-talent distribution in such a weak and final effort. Go to show, I think, if followups (in this case, to the great classic, "Umbrellas"), often does not go wrong. Can not recapture, just recreate.
