A comedy story so familiar to Paul (Jason Lee), who, after the bachelor party night, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met just one evening before. After lying about Karen's fianc√© (Selma Blair), he was forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. I'm sure most of us have been witnessing a story like this at least once ... on film or on television. The film is formidable and extremely predictable, with an end you can see coming at a mile. <br /> <br /> At least the cast gives an interest and keeps it guarded. Lee is in full swing, and Stiles is a lot of fun in a bold comedy role, different from the very serious roles he usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change the job as often as other people change their clothes. But you know, it's not exactly written. At least one question is not answered: for exactly is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's former brutal boyfriend, being investigated by IA? I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; it's a super-reckless miracle that took my nerves so quickly that I begged someone to punch him. Add another debit: a free and unbelievable cameo by the comic / actor Larry Miller, playing again grouch (in this case, it is a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister). It's not good at all, but as usual for me, I give it three out of ten based on the efforts expressed alone.
