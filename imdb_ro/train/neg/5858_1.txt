This was allotted to the fans because the "winner takes everything" match took place between two "separate" companies (World Fighting Federation and "Alliance": a merger of former WCW and ECW superstars was a team match, the fighters limited to throwing opponents from each side of the ring to another, each fighter concludes that in order to debounce his opponents and intensify the match, an intervention is required. A special hit and labels in a partner, the story of was previously stained by Vince's subterfuge that a member of Allance would be fraud and join WWF. In general: a very innovative story, but a bad execution, which is not the lack of fighters, because the format of the match is a tag team , and the remaining matches are just riots: Edge versus T est: strong "big boot" test, but this did not show the true talents of both stars Al Snow versus Christian: me but good, but superflous to pay-per-view. </ a> Taji vs. William Regal: Worst Match of the Night Battle Royal Immunity: This was a remarkably fun match to watch, but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event, only a fighter who typically appears on "Heat" and is probably a heavy WCW rejection (that is, the hurricane that is hired only as an animator) Hardy Boyz versus Dudley Boyz: The best match of the new: Jeff Hardy executed a "Swanton" bomb at the tip of a cage and a wooden table, and Matt was stuck in a cage that seemed to be extremely painful. Since Stone Cold was the WWF champion, Rob Van Dam was the hardcore champion, and Kurt Angle was a "mole" in the alliance, all of the keynote stars in the Alliance faction were awarded after the match, with the exception of Booker T., who recently attacked a fighter on "Raw" and will inevitably get work. Shane McMahon will come back on television in a way, and everyone wanted to witness the fall and resignation of the "Alliance" to see Stone Cold out of work. WWF did much better. A match where all the tiles were brought to a single fraction would have been better and what ever happened with Casket and Iron Man matches?
