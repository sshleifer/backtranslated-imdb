Following the disastrous revolution, this film was almost the final angle in the Goldcrest coffin and thus in the British cinema industry. The film is absolute pants, full of music from an attempt to revive jazz in the mid-1980s and based on a book and author who was shortly popular at that time and deserved to be worth back into obscurity. The Temple searched for the old ones trying to find Suzette and came with the 8th Wonder Patsy Kensett, another person who was shortly popular at the time. Until the film came out of post-production, the revival of Jazz ended, just like Kensett's career, and the film met with a totally indifferent film audience. Mediocre would be an overestimation for some of the worst / campest / brishiest acting to ever plow the British screen silver watch it for nearly 20 years and the movie is true cringeworthy.
