It was an absolutely terrible movie. Do not be commended by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be the worst part of history. Even their great act could not redeem the ridiculous story of this film. This film is a piece of US propaganda in the nineties. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Colombian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared falsely, and her pseudo-dear adventure with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional pity in a movie that had no real meaning. I am disappointed that there are such films, destroying the actor as Christopher Walken's name. I could barely stand by it.
