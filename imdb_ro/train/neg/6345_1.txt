this film is just an excuse for the writer to make a film of two failed scripts. Its characters are just a set of characters with tragic or comic attributes of the clich√©, the total sum of which is the neurotic dialogue only Allen faint could write. the woman loves this because they look like in the mirror so as to enjoy this movie, perhaps this movie was not enjoyed by me, however, because there was no car tracking and also, the film had no struggle. there were also drug lords or bangers gangs. Not to mention a lack of snakes. This movie did not have snakes. It's not my tea tea and maybe it's not your ether, so think about what I said before thinking about this movie. If, of course, it does not resemble a woman who has problems with weight issues, people enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this is important to you.
