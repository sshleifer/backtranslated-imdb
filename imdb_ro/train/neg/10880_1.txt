This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen and I have a pretty appetite for terrible (and good) movies. He could have (just) succeeded in a sort of adolescent humor if he consistently had a tongue in his cheek - at ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other films, such as PLAN NINE in the outer space, manage to be fun while (seemingly) trying to be serious. Regarding acting, they seem to have rounded dead dead teens and asked them to admit the entire production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the old bust-busting wide on the motorcycle.
