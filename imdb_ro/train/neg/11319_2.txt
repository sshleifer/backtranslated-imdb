Vampire cyborgists rule the world and use people's blood as fuel, yet there will be a change of power thanks to an android renegade (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) while confronting Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels with cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions left unanswered by this terrible movie, Who was the idea of ​​throwing country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give how good. No, I do not misunderstand that I saw Kristofferson as a vigilant or something, but not like a cyborg. Strange someone suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do it. However, despite disastrous casting, Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the film. It offers more human performance than the inexpressive Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) despite miscasting, Kristofferson offers some moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is weakness and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights is a staggering failure. Stay back in horror asking who the hell thinks this is really a good idea on paper. (This is a movie in which a Kristofferson dismembered robot battle in a backpack) The worst of all ends in a continuous if a sequel, fortunately this does not yet have to materialize, although I still have nightmares at proposing the likelihood of such an event. br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
