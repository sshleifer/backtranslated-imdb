Yeah, that's a summary. This movie was terrible. Two minutes I wanted to take my eyes off. This was praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not good for members of this church! I do not think any human being should be so victimized to watch a movie of this low quality. First of all, you can say that no effort has ever gone into this movie. It seems that the horrible, glib, strange blindness was thrown together by two crazy madmen somewhat impregnated with the gift of a coherent thought (at least semi-coherent). Then there is the acting, which is disturbing from * everyone * involved. Even homes fail to come alive. And let's not forget that our protagonist is a superficial villain that we would like to think he can change, but that road is full of embarrassing evil, terrible awful "gags" of Mormon, that someone in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider it pure * stupid *! This must be one of the most serious movies I've ever seen!
