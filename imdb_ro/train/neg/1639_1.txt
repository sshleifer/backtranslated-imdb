"Whipped" has a length of 82 minutes. This review has a length of 82 words. Three untrained New York Lotharios, ruthless "crooks," end up asking the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This is true for story and film. Too weak to be misogyny, flaky and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends Tom Lykis's philosophies with shock with the Penthouse fantasies. Although technically proven is dated, barbecue, poorly written, medium and obvious. People do not behave like this. People do not talk like that. Really.
