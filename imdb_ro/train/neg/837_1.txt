I saw and I really liked the first two. Especially because the second is not just an attempt to make another one as good as the first one. And it's a story alone. You do not have to know the first movie. I liked that in "Free Willy" movies as well. But ... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after half an hour. The movie is fine, there are funny parts in it all right. But for what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What is 1 1/2 Lion King for me is: a tough attempt to get more fun of the first movie than it was already, plus the story from their point of view. But for what? I really want to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two people sitting in the cinema watching the first one is pretty nice. But what comes after is largely useless. I think many people liked Timon and Pumba, so did I. However, for me many parts have been very built, with an attempt to be fun. No chance, the majority was not at all funny, at least for me. BTW. what was the movie anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun from the first film? I tend to choose b and I am very disappointed with this. If you like to see stories like: "The story behind the xy," you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead" by Tom Stop with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's very funny and do not try to get more of Hamlet then.
