This may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin ever created, but it certainly was not the best. Obviously, he did this to check the payments. Dreck like this certainly does nothing to increase his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to understand is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie they expect to be entertained without getting bored with tears. It is sad he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not understand that people do not want to see them in terrible movies. If you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be fun. That was not. Shame on the US Army to be allowed to associate with this troop. Full Metal Jacket had more laugh than this miserable excuse for a "comedy". Surely, Phil Silvers is rolling in the tomb.
