OK, the story - a simple boredom enters a bored bored life and her child brother and bad in their lives - is an interesting one. However, ideas are nothing (everyone has some ...) - execution is everything. That has bothered me with this move. And it bothers me a lot. The rhythm (targeting, editing) was slow, the rhythm was uneven and the climax awaited. I saw those highways five, six, seven times - why? The problems of Norton's character have been seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand the problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a loony? References to the "Taxi Driver" were ridiculous and useless and certainly not in favor of this move (or of E.N.). And IMHO is executed cowardly at the end. Cheap emotional cheats for adolescent lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy should have killed the kid, accused his father, created a real disaster. Or the child should have killed the father at the end etc., but not, we ended up with cheeses where the children are missing, and the father is perplexed by his own life and the relationship with them, and the inheritance, of course, dies. The happy family of dysfunction remains unharmed, safe and happily bored again, to enjoy the hungry popcorn, indescribable. And that scene in which the movie returns, oh my God, I should think long and hard to find something worse than that! Do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Movie creators probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas anywhere or anywhere, and if you dream to have sex with a crazy man twice, well, then you could enjoy this movie and his "message."
