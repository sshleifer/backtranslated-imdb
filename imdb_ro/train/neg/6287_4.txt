I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman who one day wakes up in the car. Well, I thought, this could be interesting ... but it's not. First, the title. The Broken? What shaken ... what? What is broken? A ... wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing that goes for it. The premise is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in "Mirrors." A cross between the invasion of robbers and mirrors, and a fairly mediocre one. A more appropriate title would be "The Boring," because it highlights every scene for bloody ages. Or maybe "The Confusing" because it does not explain anything, not so much in the narrative as in the story itself, but just a vague idea about bad kids and something like cheap scams and deadly scenes, but nothing tangible. She is just messed up. On the other hand, action and special effects are pretty good, but again, it is not a difficult role to play. the movie twice, I feel still unhappy, a little confusing, and not in the way of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not look at it. Simply, there are better thrillers out there.
