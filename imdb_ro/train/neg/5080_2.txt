This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a movie from the late eighties, about the ability of a serious boy to play video games and go through the whole credit. Wiz is an unnecessary update to the Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is the guy who attached 100 straws together and had some drink of drink. out of the way, let me say this: really there is no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100-minute Nintendo commercial designed to harness Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the freest possible because it seems that this movie was written over a weekend by the crack team of people who have never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Perhaps if the writer and the director sat down and played along games, they realize they want to film all the garbage and go to the vocational school to learn how to install the car stereo. we hope it was a luminous experience for you. Of course it was not for me. In fact, I think I would have lost a few people in the role of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you are at the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard in Oz, all sitting on the shelf in a rather small row, give everyone a wish and play instead Duck Hunt.
