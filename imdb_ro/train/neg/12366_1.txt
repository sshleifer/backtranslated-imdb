"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen with the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from performances such as "Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There is no resemblance to the original characters, and the stories are boring and badly made. The new models are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show does not work. This horrible animation loss is a complete failure and this should be nothing but a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
