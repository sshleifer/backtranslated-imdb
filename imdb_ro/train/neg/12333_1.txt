A-Bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look at her usual full of love in this, which normally makes me forgive them and a superficial schtick. Hard to believe he was the dog's producer. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide travel did his career have? Someone ... Banzai !!! Finally, it was directed by the guy who made Big Chill? It must be a resumption of the Hollywood style Jonestown style. Wooofff!
