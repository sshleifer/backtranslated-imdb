My mother keeps a tape of this film as a general threat to any movie-loving person who bothers her. Everything about that is smelly. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a true classic. Who gave it 10/10? Did you accidentally notice a good movie and accidentally vote for it? All those involved in the filming process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film. It should be an indelible stain on the mind of all that the sacred film holds and be venerated as the tide mark of the terrible cinema.
