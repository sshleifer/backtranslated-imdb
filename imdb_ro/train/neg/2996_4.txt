Born Again is a substandard episode of the first season. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and does not fly. I have never been great at reincarnation, and that could be a part of my apathy for this episode. It refers to the Tooms, which is a wonderful sequel to the previous episode. But the positions end up there. What is unfortunate because it occurs at the beginning of the episode. I think it is absurd that a dead guy would choose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And wait until the girl turns eight to start revenge. There is even a serious lack of clever Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode on the waterline. If you're reincarnating, maybe that episode is yours. If you are not, then at least you can find out what bradycardia is.
