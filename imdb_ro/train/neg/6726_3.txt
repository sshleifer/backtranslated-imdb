Anyone who has seen Shine, Scott Hicks, about the unimaginable and ultimately joyous life of pianist David Helfgotts; I'm sure you understand that "SOLOIST" is very poor in comparison. It's as slow as a song (I took five breaks by answering emails just to wake up). The image of the homeless and extremely indulgent homeless area, on the one hand, I'm afraid of the terrible image of the beach battle in another disaster of Joe Wrights Attonment. . Fox's performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from offset.Downey on the other; although he is struggling with a bad movie, still manages to increase his charm if he turns me into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing the two so-called "STAR" actors, though unnecessary, because the shining brighter light for acting must be that of Geoeffry Rush "Shine's," which has a brilliant performance, certainly brighter in the sky. With both "Attonment" and "Solistul" the written word gains much more awards for the empathy of the subject. Read the book and the articles, or wait for the DVD to be in the basement of the business soon.
