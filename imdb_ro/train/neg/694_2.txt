It's in the early 1980s. There is a group of teenage suspects. And he's a maniac who looks around. Yes, this is slasherville. This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I do not have the slightest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a good joke is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bats, not a big joke; in fact, quite a joke of garbage if the truth is told. But there you go. The film itself refers to a group of teenagers who are in charge of cleaning a dormant bedroom. They become aware of the fact that a psychopath is at large. To combat this evolution, they broke up and wandered into the darkness. It ends with tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a bad slasher movie made. The DVD I saw was Vipco. It looks like a bit of violence has been cut off. This makes the DVD even more useless, because, let's face this, a flying movie hit by violence is a waste of time. For motion pictures and motion pictures, but not only.
