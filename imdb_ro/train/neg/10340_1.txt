This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I looked mainly from a morbid curiosity, because I liked the novel and I wish I was not. We stopped it in less than an hour, though I wanted to stop it in five minutes. I'd like to have. She ignores the novel very much and changes all sorts of factors. If the movie failed to redeem in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. I do not believe, as many people say, that "The Jar Jar" is necessarily unfathomable, but this special teaching could have been done without. I'd love to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do justice.
