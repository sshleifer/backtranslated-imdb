I watched the entire movie, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault because I look bad and horrible instead of psychology? This is a strange remake of the oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and make musical theater with him? I did not understand why certain elements of the plot were actually present: why was the upstart construction, why was that great staircase, with a perfect place for someone to fall into the doom, if no one does, for who have scenes at all with the father at work, why do you have such a cute kitchen if you are going to eat, why the boy would like to be baptized and the parents to be the opposite of the opposite. I see a lot of good reviews for this movie ... my taste was corrupted, going up with 70 old science movies and movies?
