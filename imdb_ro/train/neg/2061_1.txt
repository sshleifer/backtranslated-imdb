The only movie I've ever left. Amazing because I paid for my and my date and I'm very cheap. But my brain could not stand any danger, especially because I could have written more funny stuff while you were tied and gagged. From the beginning to the end this movie offends. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny then, and sure it's not funny now. But even worse, this film is the beginning of the end of a truly smart and sophisticated comedy. It is a juvenile, very sophomorical scenario, and ideas have begun an era (which continues until now), where cheap cheating and sexual innocence dominate the comedy culture of the film. Sexual Olympics? What high school kid did not think about it? The beginning of the end.
