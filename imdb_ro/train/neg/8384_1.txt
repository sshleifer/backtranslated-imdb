When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie in the 250 bottom films, I thought it was too harsh, but I did not know that the low rating was absolutely correct. I'm a big fan of Wayans. I liked Scary 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were obsolete. Obviously, the joke will rotate around Marlon Wayans, who plays a big kitten who was recently released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond for a gangster. Things go wrong and the cat has to place the diamond with a wonderful young man played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, shoes claim to be an abandoned child left on unsuspecting couples doors. Of course, he is taken and the drama starts looking for the diamond. The film has several actors and actors from Saturday Night Live such as Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as from Living Living. All of these talents, however, can not help the poor scenario and the jokes that were simply not funny. The special effects of making Marlon Wayans look like a kitten was OK. I mean, he was not 100% credible, but he was OK ... nothing wonderful. I just want the Wayans to make more effort to develop a good joke scenario, instead of trying to embellish the bad scenes with camouflages from their famous actors and comic actresses. or television. It really does not deserve any amount of money.
