Without a turbulent turbulence turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), American War and Agatha Christie, with a big and big problem: it's a deadly madman. In addition to a single I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is pouring berserk. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) is a great starter for him: he plays a romantic role (with his appearance and his age, he and Woody Allen should start a club for non-aged comedians without a mirror) to either moving and funny, meaningful and intelligent, trying to sing and dance and succeeds in NO! Once again, I thought I had a proper myopia, because everyone in the movie continues to say that Cherry Jones is a pretty hot girl and that Michael Cumpsty is this stallion impossible to be beautiful! The guy who interprets Claire Bloom's male secretary is a thin, pallid, thin, sexy actor as a chair and is the subject of the two leading ladies' passion! Mike Starr, acting as the most incompetent and phonetic policeman you've ever seen, deserves to be among the 10 most abominable shows in the recent history of the movie. The saddest note is to see the wonderful dirty and offensive Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa. At least I hope both stars have paid their bills back home (and then fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder the successful actress, Sukowa, returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood did for her! If you want to see how to make a really bad movie from a very bad scenario with a casting berserk director, study this - else stay away! - 1/10
