So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who not only wants to dive into a river that is full of crocci, snakes, lizards, reptiles of reptiles mentioned above and mud not only daily, but with enthusiasm. He never managed to make me do that, but he managed to get his wife to get closer. This film does not fit into my parallel film category - movies for people who just had their teeth are perforated, have a migraine or have no film experience, and therefore deserve quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney movies ). It's too noisy. Steve is too noisy. He is so happy all the time and would cut straight through the blas√© adolescent (I hear him now: "that movie was so stupid") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm is to catch, but if it were, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that they are beautiful, but you will not spend it yet. The plot was indeed predictable. The bad guys were so bad, for one minute I thought they were shopping at an electronic supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, that's why I watched him. That plot (if you could say that) was really more reason to throw another croc in a truck. My expectations were low and they stayed that way. We still hope there will be a bit of continuation, where Steve and Terri (who have worked on their acting skills) have a real-life movie and more fur animals. I still can not believe we will not see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in Australia's zoo and discovery channel at least. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without a member of the Irwin family telling me how great the crocodile is. Crikey!
