Mmm, does not he have a great bunch of good pancakes? The mustard syrup and the fruit are kept on the top. Get a mouth. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. Eat, you! Keep it clean on the neck until the face turns green with nausea. You only had Ally McBeal experience. <br /> <br /> I gave this show in the winter of '98 and was immediately caught. Like the pancake truck, I gorgered him. But the joy soon took off, because the character of Ally McBeal (which we will see to be cute and cute at first glance) soon becomes the most annoying, unreliable complainant, you have ever known her. (Tell me a feminist, but I prefer my female lead to a backbone.) GAG and performance gimmicks also become sharpened, Vonda Shepherd's music (which is really put in front of you) gets scratched , and the unceasing character changes and rewrites make a show in a damn soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and get out as soon as it becomes upsetting (and will). I did it in 2.5 seasons before my joy was totally sad. It was good while it lasted but, like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend just transformed ugly after exceeding her welcome term. <br /> <br /> And next time you go to IHOP, jump over the pancakes. Order something healthy like fruit. He'll be a lot better with you.
