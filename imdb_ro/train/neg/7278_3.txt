This hardly watched film was a bit of an attempt to stay in the way. None of the segments is good, but at least the first one is slightly funny, and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. The latter was simply brutal, and after staying with two short comedy pants, the third was really painful to watch. Even due to the low standards of the National Lampoon, it seemed particularly boring and unhappy.
