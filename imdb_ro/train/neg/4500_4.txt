This movie is not terrible, indeed. Someone commented that Mo is the type of American European. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxons, who do not care about the French; and the Xavier character will not influence them. Let's think of his French stereotype attribute: 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reed, physically check, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Work ethic worker. Check it out. (Forget about being a rich broker from watching him in the movie he seems to put in ten weeks of work). Beautiful wife, check it out. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage jury. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). A big sexual ego that says an American girl owes you sex if you buy dinner. Check. Whether Mo is a hick or not, there is no reason for her to fall for this European smug dump, otherwise the scenario dictates this. On the other hand, like other male reviews, I liked to see Karen Allen's cute and beautiful body. I will give the film four stars; two of them are for that.
