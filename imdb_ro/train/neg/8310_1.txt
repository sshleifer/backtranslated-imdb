Another vast conspiracy film that attempts to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the army) for every disaster in the Great Depression. Anyone who has ever served time in the US Army can see how fake this movie is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and manners are wrong. (And, of course, all high-ranking officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots). Blatant propaganda without any attempt at objectivity. Most of the presented theories have been denied in recent years. Use every clich√© ", rumor, and Urban Legend in the Gulf - all are presented as Gospel. (The truth is that nobody knows for certain why some GW veterinarians are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS It's nothing new. War is NOT fun, and I know World War II veterans, Korean and Viet Nam with some serious illnesses too. (And the government has a responsibility to take care of all of this.) Such sensational movies will not solve problem!
