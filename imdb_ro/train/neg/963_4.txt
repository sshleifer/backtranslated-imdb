Chances are a big mistake to see. You could meet director Emile Ardolino from "Dirty Dancing" and "Sister Act" and should expect something funny from him. But I think I have to disappoint you. He made a really bad movie. According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to warm up like a baby. The child grows up with Robert Downey Jr and Jr turns his former home town where his old daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson, meets (complicated, is not she?). They fall in love with one another. Then comes Jr ex-wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her. I think I do not even have to mention that he loves Ryan O'Neil. In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr is the worst. He copied Michael J Fox. Shepherd's "Moonlighting" proves she is not suitable for acting in movies. However, there is one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as an antidote to insomnia.
