The story relates to a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris), who is employed by her beauty aunt Estee Lauder. Her aunt (through the marriage we must suppose) tries to discover her lost family in Europe. All that needs to be continued is a photo of a girl standing next to an ornamented music box. The researcher is heading for Europe and conducting searches in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The landscape is the real thing and it's actually shot in the location (unlike a crime, she wrote where Jessica should visit a remote location and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, he meets a young man who is looking for and solving a mystery of his own family and joining the team to identify clues and to jeopardize bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this because of the landscape, but the script was so bad that I only stayed to see if it had worsened. Did. The action has also been stopped. I can see why Mel Harris's career did not really take off after thirty years, but it's appropriate (but it seems too old for her co-star). But the supporting players are directly from the community playhouse. I also lost the number of times I say "Budapest" to each other. Yeah, it's Bood-a-phesht. We know, all right? I realized halfway through the film that this film was supposed to be one of Harlequin's movies and she's pretty sure. I think that's what it says.
