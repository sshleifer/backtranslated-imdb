Primary Species (1996, by Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists have a surprise when their merchandise turns out to contain living dinosaurs. The army commanders must think fast if they want to prevent the disappearance of the human species instead of reptiles. Look at the cover and get the first impressions of the movie. That's pretty much. The act is only acceptable from a few characters. The story is poor, the entire film is based on the army and the sailors who try to kill the dinosaurs. This movie came out three years after "Jurassic Park". Instead, this movie seems to have gone 13 years before Jurassic Park. Dinosaur costumes are so badly made, and it means costumes. There are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempt to hide it. A scene where a dinosaur leaks over a corridor is created in a way that somebody seems to travel to the creature. It's a good thing that comes out of this movie. Short running time. In just 1 hour and 15 minutes, do not waste too much of your life, but try to avoid it altogether. "It's like a nightmare Friday, 13." - Officer (Brian Currie)
