It's one of the fun things about being young that someone can easily be fooled by advertising. I talked before with another movie, in which the commercial for the movie (comedy) makes it look more fun than it is. Seeing the announcement for this in 1981 made me think this would be a great funny movie. What I and my brother who went and I saw with me do not know that the scene used in the TV ad was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of all those who have appeared in the film, I can only guess that there was nothing more fun to use! The last scene is, thanks to a youthful potion, Dr. Fu Manchu returns from an old man in a long beard, to a bright Asian girl / Elvis as a rock star! (With back-up songs not less!) Established for no real reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers did all the best with the material at hand, but he did not give any good reason for "comedic "Moments. The other actors were just bored, and my brother and I just stood with all that laugh. It was normal we were expecting a Pink Panther comedy, Peter Sellers was so great about that. <br /> <br /> It's a shameful shame that this was his last film before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more fun than this bad flop conceived. However, I do not blame him. I blame everyone else because I'm not trying to make a better movie about it. 2 stars is generous!
