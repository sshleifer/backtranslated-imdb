This film is poor. It has a horrible taste, it is pedestrian and unconvincing in the scenario, although it is supposed to be based on real events - that adds nothing but nothing more than a disappointment. Direction is not well done because scenes and dialogue are out of place. You're not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To begin with, Williams is not convincing as a homosexual in a relationship break, nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is bound by an ugly pedophile story, which is basic and does not happen as a plotting device. You have an older Rory Culkin, tasting "d_ck_smker" - in a pleasant fun - which is quite annoying and then laughed at the character of Williams. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as a ward angel advisor to Williams and threw it into explaining the whole fiasco to the end. The character of Toni Collete is simply annoying and a re-hash of his 6th Sense performance with a poorer direction. Very missed.
