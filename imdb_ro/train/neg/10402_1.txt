Well ... Tremors I, the original started in 1990 and I found the movie pretty nice to watch. however, they made the second and third tremors. Believe me, these movies started to descend right after they finished first, I mean, blasters fund ??? Now only God Himself is able to answer the question: "Why in the name of God would create another of these dives of a movie?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact, it can not be considered a symbol of the bad movie, because it lives more than that. As I tried to talk, I noticed my eyes bleeding and I was hoping the little girl in the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really believe that the clothing of those who looked in the other movies as if they were from the wild west would make the movie (with exactly the same appearances) somewhat better? honestly, I would never suggest to buy this movie, that is, cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
