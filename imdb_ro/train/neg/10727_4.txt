The movie is worth watching only if you stop it in half an hour. Start with fun conversations in a bar and make you expect a good, funny story. I can tell you he will not come. It will deteriorate in a few minutes in a movie that causes your patience as well as shameful feelings for actors at a length that you probably will not be pleased to confess. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity which, according to him, most people in this globalized world experience. I was amazed to hear that. Do I live in the same world she lives in? Okay, a lot of people are walking in the same clothes as mine and listening to the same music and everything, but that does not make me feel like losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we are watching? Are I short or is he? Well, my vote: the good start of the movie saves him from getting 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
