Quite possible. As Francis Veber, one of the world's finest comedy directors (at least when he lacks his native France), has succeeded in transforming himself into such a completely undiscovered film beyond the motif of a mere mortal man to discern. Not only are the characters so inappropriate, or the film is so completely devoid of the smallest form of intelligence: it is really painful to look physically, such an endless parade of writing, acting and stunning filming that you can not I think this is the work of experienced and talented composers. As soon as the eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf, before her theatrical release in a moment, and she misses it, she tells the whole story. What did they think?
