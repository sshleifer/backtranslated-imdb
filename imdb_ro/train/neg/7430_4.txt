It's interesting to see how Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond was on the stage. In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan interprets Patrick gently, working ghetto children conducting "trusted courses." He tells a woman who has a standard mop-top mid-90s boy named Eric. The former drunk husband of the woman soon arrives on stage and begins to boast with Pierce. In one stage, Pierce innocents "vegeburs". The husband enters. Pierce resumed, making veggie vegetables. Her husband then attacks Pierce. The small half-eaten vegeburger calls fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight ends suddenly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
