I saw this movie at its premier at Sundance 09. Since American Beauty is a movie that has something to say, I had hopes at Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, out of the countless films I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I ever wanted to leave earlier. The most serious problem with Towelhead is that it obviously comes from a collection of "challenging" concepts of cultural stereotypes rather than a human organic drama. The script derives from the novel by the same name of Alicia Erian. Edith Wharton's well-known quote comes to mind: I never knew a novel that would be good enough to be good despite being adapted to the author's political opinions. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so outdated and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white defamers, Towelhead's black men, black-haired portraits, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc. they were fresh, it's been a long time. For a more detailed review, please look for any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone evaluates this poor film and exposes the deep and manipulative tissue on which it relies. On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem more bambooed. As you read reviews from this site and similar sites, you'll often encounter superlatives: "amazing," "stunning," "profound," "shocking" ... It makes me bother to read but not surprise -me. Indeed, I have met many people who seem to consider any book or film dealing with racial, cultural, sexual or sexual issues to be profoundly moving, provocative, profound. If you are such a person, by all means, rent towels and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set higher standards, you can safely go about it.
