This is an extremely stupid and little-seen film about slavery in the West Indies and sees Puddy at the "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this movie and was considerably thinner here. Oliver Reed won a top prize, but he was not at all in the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it's fun to see all the young and exorbitant wives of rich old men who ask him to do it because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays a bordello owner and is so much nudity in the movie. If her orgies are not drunk at bordello, then her young wives are coming back with him. Then, of course, to the end, the slaves rebel and there is a feeling of bleeding. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another plot device built to move the story along. Unbelievably they made a sequel, and Warburton and the rest of the cast have returned! I hope he paid them a lot of dough, because this first movie is pretty bad. Nudity keeps him safe and Warburton's lack of accent sometimes makes him ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
