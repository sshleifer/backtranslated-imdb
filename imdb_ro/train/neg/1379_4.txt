Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughter and some intentional violence. I would not say they are soaked in blood; but there is insult and harm. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has a strangely adaptable presence on the screen, but has a terrific experience to be chosen for the tracks he follows. There is always a nephew of a producer or a seemingly trivial motive for not being given the role he is looking for. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max gets obsessed with such thoughts. Rewarding career is just a blow, push and shoot. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameo de Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, this is the business show ... or is it?
