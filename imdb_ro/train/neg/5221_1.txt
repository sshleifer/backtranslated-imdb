Hello from Denmark and someday I had a movie night with my friends. One brought this film with him "Russian Terminator" and it was extremely horrible. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to move in front of some ridiculous "ridiculous" or I should say "fireworks" in the film. In fact, I was very surprised to find that this film was produced here in my homeland in Denmark ... which should have been the biggest mistake ever made in this country.
