When he asks me who's the worst movie I've ever seen. There is almost no riffing at the MST3k level, nor at midnight watching at a theater, or even as a nightclub at Disney Channel. The only time I wanted to go for a walk at Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket from the mannequin, tear it to pieces and bury the guides "Eat Eat this endless layer of darkness! " I've never been so upset about a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon." Do you want beautiful colors and cinema? She's not a babe here. Reporters continue to say, "Oh, but it also looks like a comic book," well, for me, Gordito's color after a few weeks in the sun. Just as pleasant. Beatty wanders around this landscape by jumping around and talking to his own watch, and occasionally to the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time he'll keep filming. To be fair, I only saw this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not of God.
