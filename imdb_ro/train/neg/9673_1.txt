"Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all forms of life," informs a victim who might be a victim in "The Seedpeople," a stupid and flawed remake of "Invasion of Corpses," "Triphids Day" and about thousands of moisture . And why seeds are more dangerous than plants, could they ask? Because, according to the same stick, "the seeds can trace us". Yeah, I remember a scary incident when MooCow was just a calf, being followed all the time from school school by dandelion seed ... Yeah, okay. Unfortunately, "monsters" of this kind of sweet ginger resemble some small muppets, some of which roll like bad bruises, others sailing on the ropes. There is not even the slightest beating of terror or suspense. For unexplained reasons, seed monsters are hit by 50-volt ultraviolet lamps, even if they can walk in the daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more UV power. As you can see, it was not much thought in this cow flop. MooCow says she goes to the garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
