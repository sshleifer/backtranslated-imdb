There were a lot of unfamiliar movies or movies, with bad reviews that I really liked. It was not one of them. He was over-activated and used room techniques that made me feel like I saw a ditch. It was predictable ridicule and took most of the movie to go, then let him ask "is that?" Once I decided not to take the movie seriously and pursue it purely, it was more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have been overturned on the MST3000 if it had still begun.
