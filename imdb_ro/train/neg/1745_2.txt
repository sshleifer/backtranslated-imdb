The first half hour of the film had a steady rhythm and introduced the characters. However, all of a sudden everything was happening too quickly, an agonizing motif for Akshey Kumar so far, three faces, very strong, acting both by Akshey and by John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the culmination of the film, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall this movie was the biggest disappointment of the movie is not right on its trailer. save money and do not watch this movie, watch it again on Hera Pheri and Hungama! Summary: a cheap scene shows the performance and the appearance of the film without story or substance, the plot was extraordinary to feel the good music of Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! the film was shot in a single room, newcomers (female casting) were fine because it was their first film, but actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed a director that Priyadarshan gave the worst film ever!
