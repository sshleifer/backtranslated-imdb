The movie starts slowly when we get to the cinema that we thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored of our minds and wondering what kind of movie we came to see, I do not like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was when the alarms and lights came back because the project broke because we thought we could go home. this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen that we've all been bored or lying, and most of the people in the cinema, actually RAN, got out of the door at the end of the year because it was so fuckin '. I'm surprised no one came out earlier than that. if you go and see that it makes sure you have something to keep busy, you better yet You're not going to see at all.
