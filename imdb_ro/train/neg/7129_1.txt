This will be best known for Ferrari who was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion. The racing and betting story is a poorly made number that seems to have a director who could not see numbers. To a great extent a point and draws an adventure with a group of actors in it for a salary. This is not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be watched and reach out as some who do not deserve the movie, no matter how you look at it. Misogynist, despite in fact, one of the leaderships is a woman, this is a movie that was made clearly only to get the producer and the director close to the beautiful girls. Do you want proof? There are long, long-lasting women's photos near anything that serve no purpose other than to get people growing too afraid to rent a porn or swimsuit sports swimsuit. Avoid this movie at all costs
