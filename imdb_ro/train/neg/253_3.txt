The premise of the film has been explained, and if you have gone so far, do not pretend to be a film critic. That's what I told myself that my opinion about the film is pretty low. I am a fan of Takashi Miike, but this falls into the category of his not so wonderful work, along with DOA 2 and 3, and others (many). The film seems to get a free pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing can do wrong Takashi. This is an age-old approach to cinema. For the rest of us we will find an hour and a half of a child crying without really real annoying reason (and yes, this is away from the film), the rhythm of the film almost reaching the levels of rigomortis, and in the quality ... well .. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> If someone is a Takashi fan you will see it regardless of the peaks of interest. It is devoid of any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the main character in the face of a conflict other than rather superficial. <br /> <br /> As has been emphasized this is the first movie Miike was credited with co-writing, but that does not mean much like not what we had hoped would Miike's personality spill over in the screen. Everything we get is some of Miike's visual signs towards the film director. The film had the potential to be something great. The premise is not difficult to run. But it seemed to have been driven to the ground. My suggestion is that if you enter Miike you go with some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film in his works, such as Blue Harp, Fudoh, Rain Dog, Chinese bird birds.
