<br /> <br /> Back in his youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade it. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and a girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored by Brother # 1 and jumping into Brother # 2's bed. The three brothers might be thought to be stuck somewhere on a remote island. But they are not Europeans of high class going to college and busy in the social world. We never see a flirty moment between any irrelevant woman and the two brothers. We never see a flirtatious moment between an unconnected man and a single sister. All flirting moments are divided only between brothers and sisters. The weakest part of the GLADIATOR was incest. The young emperor, Commodus, would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of married girls all over, but did not just want his sister? If the film incest is a cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will awaken (slowly) endlessly.
