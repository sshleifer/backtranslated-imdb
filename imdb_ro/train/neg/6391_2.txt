hg is normally an exploiter and never bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I do not like pseudo-science or heuristic play. the whole movie is based on a man who caused an electric accident and a witch. I do not oppose witches and liked "carrie" (novel and film), but this has bothered me. I think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electrical line. also, the university professor losing his time studying esp cases. I was not alive in the 1960s to know for the first time whether ESP was a common mistake or not then, but I assume that any theory of this kind would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was how the police described schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains, who resemble 99% of ordinary people and then just for a moment. nothing can be further from the truth. I hate such concepts because they add to the public idiot. many people still believe that schizophrenia is a disociative identity disorder. anyone who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. There were some decent concepts for the film. I liked the way the witch used people; it was a pleasant change. I liked how she could become attractive, but she did not do it when she was around her forced lovers. I found it interesting to burn his face to him. the script was touched a few weeks before production and did not focus exclusively on making the audience rely on, maybe it was a decent film.
