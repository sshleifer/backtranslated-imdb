80 minutes, and felt twice as much! Crossing is not short enough. Indeed, the first 50 minutes consist almost entirely of a dialogue (rather than a monologue, indeed) of a woman approaching middle-aged, betraying sadness about "men," disappointment, sex, aging and the recent separation, adolescence met in the ship's canteen. The tiring monologue continues as she goes to the duty-free shop, and to a bar, where they finally involve him. "Story" can not end there, of course, so she convinces him to listen more to the drones as he brings him into the cabin. What a little story, sex or, nothing in this movie has, besides bitter roots, hard enough to justify the price of a rental if you are not one of those who love dramas in which nothing interesting happens. Yes, the end is very well done, but it is an insufficient reward for obeying what a living room transformation is in a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner. Of course, some people like this one. I may be wrong.
