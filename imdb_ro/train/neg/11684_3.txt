This film makes no sense, there are enough big holes to drive enormous NYPD through. Characters are not at all plausible. I'll put my comments in chat, but save time and money, it's bad. I can not stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on the flash bang and uses fantasy editing and cool music and does not get tired of having a plot hanging together at the most basic level. But it is nice to see that Denzel W. predominates over the Man Who Comes in 3 Flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp. There is even a sweet little child with a video game that is beautiful.
