do not be suckered in renting this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death, despite the title (English). I can not think of one good thing to say about the movie. Poor activity, bad editing, poor targeting ... ridiculous plot, and sound / music was so irritating, it's surprising that this movie does not come with a warning label. The only possible way to stay in this movie and enjoy it is for its historical quality of joy. They just do not make movies so bad.
