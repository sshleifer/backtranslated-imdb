So we had low expectations for this movie to start with, but it did not even meet those. While there were funny parts, even one or two laughing strong parts, this film fell very little from what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very fast, letting us stay there, going "WTF just happened?" In addition, there have been some jokes that have just dragged and continued. the part he falls on the mountain has yawned me. Also, editing was missing. there have been some poor transitions of the scene, but this seems to be the style of today. I was laughing, but I would not look again, and I'm glad I waited to rent it. give it a chance, you might enjoy it, but you do not think you're in something like 40-year-old virgins or Superbad.
