This movie is extremely boring, says the story of a petrol station owner and her life. Nothing interesting is ever happening. The director has "really kept it" and feels like a room that follows a woman while living her life. I had to see other movies of this director for a class, the others were not so boring. This movie was also pursued for a mission ... it is better to borrow a good note! Generally, if not necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not cut other movies of this director because they're not that bad ... and do not expand other films about Africa, they're usually good, especially when they're made by a Western director.
