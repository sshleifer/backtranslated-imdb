This comedy has some funny stuff, surrounded by a lot of unpleasant things. Almost every scene involving the miners of the castle and their foolish antics is a waste of time. And the plot is so negligent that it makes you wonder if they actually had a scenario prepared before they started filming this or just did everything while they were going together. (* 1/2)
