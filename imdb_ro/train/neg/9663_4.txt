How cynical the writers are, to give them all. Maybe I am an American citizen, but I do not have to see that other Americans are lying on their back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I'm amazed that so few have commented on how he really is jingoist, sentimental and lived the dialogue in this movie. The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in the U-571 (which changes the British submarines to Americans), but still go far, feeling a little thin. Indeed, the Germans in this film only admit Americans between battle scenes! How sad, useless! I would like to tell the writers: it is obvious to many of us that you can not capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that you have some very well-controlled shortcuts. Lucky for you, it will not always be a nationalist disappointment to appreciate your sugar-coated muffins.
