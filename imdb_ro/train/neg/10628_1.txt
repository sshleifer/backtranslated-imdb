This so-called "documentary" is trying to say that the US falsified the moon's landing. Year straight. All those who have studied the case have different chances. First of all: there is definite proof. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought back many LIBE rock - for geological studies. These have been spread around the world to hundreds of laboratories that have tested them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from the ground, because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth but similar to those that are believed to be on the moon. I.E. conspiracy theorists do not study anything: they only take what falls within their theory and ignore the rest. Another wrong claim on their part is that he was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, the flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved him with his hand, so he moved. And what proves this: Well, if the conspiracy theorists would have studied the event, they will see that the NEVER flag does not move after the astronaut has left it. the conspiracy theorists are evil scientists, they can not study a subject properly or study it only until they have what they came to, so they can make a lie and get a profit (IE this so- called "documentary"). A claim says it's not possible to have been filmed on the Moon, because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, artificial lighting in the studio. Again conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same thing would happen in a desert of earth at night, without light sources. But I doubt that a theorist of the conspiracy has ever been outside the grandmother's basement for more than a few days a Star Treck convention was maintained. Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They just see what they want to see. So they make all these lies seem important - this is a fact.
