I watched this show and just did not seem funny at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately, I realize that ABC plays countless shows today and goes down like a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if it is good, the jokes and scenarios are pretty horrible and would still bring the show. I would say that I think this show will be canceled, but seeing ABC become horrible for the quality of the performances it plays, it could keep it just because it is average compared to them.
