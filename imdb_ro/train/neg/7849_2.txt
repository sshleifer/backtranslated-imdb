The film takes over the past few years with the remake with the army setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the first movie attacks occurred. The crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers take part in a training exercise to find no one around. You can complete the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a salary picture around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances or anyone in the back of the room. This is a movie that was made for money and nothing else. At a certain level, this should have worked, it could have been a more worrying threat to the south (if national guards struggle with some people in marshlands), but instead of giving up nothing. For the most part, you can blame the script, incredibly written in part by Wes Craven, which strikes again and again the same old targets. Add to the mess that the direction is boring and the configuration of the sequences is so lacking in gloss to eliminate any inherent tension in any scene. It's not bad, but bad and boring. Allow me to put my feelings in context: The reason I saw this movie was that a local multiplex hurt and ran this movie instead of the kids who hit the Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the cry (that is, movies have that in common - says sarcastically). I'm sure this movie will scare only those who like the last Mimzy.
