I watched the first time 2/28/2006 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I watched entitled "3 days from Condor" - So the CIA drama full of relaxation performance made for a very relaxed movie . The premise of this story revolves around 7 of the eight members of a CIA research group murdered with the character of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, being the one left. Who killed them and why? It's what Redford is trying to find out while trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. Along the way, he involved Faye Dunaway's character involved, initially because he needs a place to hide, and then finally helps him after a little bit of love. This is one of the innocent hand on the stories, but it does not have much suspense. Flat performance does not help and finish does not end the business for the audience enough. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical performers, story and performance are not what they should be, and therefore the film is not what it should be.
