I hired the DVD in the hope of a good Western. The movie was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. In the first part, why did the bad guy just kill the owner of the mine? He is not really connected to the movie except to determine how bad he was and to have a hiding place. The bank employee hurt himself just acting too badly to make a convincing decision to hire killers from his employers. Let's keep our guess at least. No character has ever been developed for bank owners or bank employees. <br /> <br /> A very long delay in what's going on for the most part. <br /> <br /> The absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the tape confessed he was killing in-laws. Even more absurd that confessing to judging and judging will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hangs and the ropes break, then the sheriff takes the gun to return to his town and save his wife from the bad employee of the bank. Would he not come back after the gang's expedition to save his wife and arrest a bad boy? Just send the judge a note that the tape confessed before he was killed on the path ???? !!! In general, the act is very sad and no point to the film.
