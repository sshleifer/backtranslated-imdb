First of all - there's absolutely no flirting with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. Your first test of resistance is to get over 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. This would not be so bad - damn it, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to introduce it, it is repulsive. So you succeed through torture and chaos. Then we meet Donna and the movie turns into something totally different - not better - just different: a heartless picture of the road. There are heavy comic attempts due to camouflages - mostly written and broadcast by publications such as Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and a few prostitutes and dragons). Everyone deserves better. The photo is deliberately disoriented, so if you get motion sickness (or any kind of illness) - this movie is not for you. I want to think about it, I'm not sure just about who this movie is - except for homosexual and bisexual S & M fans who like indo-written, indie films about themselves.
