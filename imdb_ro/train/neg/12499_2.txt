I went to the film as a Sneak Preview in Austria. So he had no idea what I would see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I think it could have cut to 1/2 without causing trouble in the story. It's the type of movie you can see on a boring night you want to get bored more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is all right. The film talks about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, how they live, and the problems they face. Because there are no effects in the movie. So if you want to watch it, then you do not have to waste your money and go to Cinema. It would be more effective to look at it when it's done on DVDs.
