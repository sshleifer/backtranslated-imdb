Wow what a wonderful premise for a movie: Set it around a film producer with a block of writers who decide to take tango lessons. Hey and what an even better idea casts the central role of a film producer who is interested in tango. God, I'd like to have that genius talent. Yeah, I'm sarcastic. It amazes me that this type of zero potential to make money movies is made. Come on if you are not a fan of tango patience (but I think there is judgment on comments) or a tough member of fan club Sally Potter (?) There is nothing in this movie that makes you hurry to the cinema to see it. Even if you're in tango, much of the movie is taken up by meaningless scenes, such as a refurbished house or a wheelchair man walking along a road <br /> <br /> LATTI REVIEW where an unsuccessful scriptwriter from Scotland is in front of a computer writing very sarcastic, but extremely fun film reviews he has seen. He's in shock that Theo Robertson puts his boots in the newest Hollywood blockbuster, complains in sympathy, as he receives another letter of rejection from a film company, falls in craving when he's bathing and spits the soap over his body well toned. Exam lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if someone is stupid enough to fund PS movie Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter
