I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was a useless change of format. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This film looks like a remake of any other common detective drama in the past. And this is the disturbing reason, because Columbo is not an ordinary detective. There are two parts in this movie that left me interesting. First of all, I do not realize the title of this movie. It's misleading. Perhaps a better title would have been "The Bridal Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides a test without giving the reason (at least for the viewers) why he does. I do not feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk has returned to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
