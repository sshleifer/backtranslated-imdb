I do not know where to begin. This movie feels very much like one of those cheap children on Saturday morning that shows they were back in the late eighties in the early nineties. Some kind of Power Captain or Power Rangers. It is full of bad digital overlays and really noisy sounds of "secret agents" and villains. The act is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity so far. It seems someone has cast a lot of scenes together and forgot it should have been a plot. Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film comes at first, an explosive device in an agent car. For some reason, even if the device is clearly said to be "detonated remotely," the bad guys decide to chase her on the motorcycle as she moves away. This tracking continues. all the time with the bad guys who make strange and completely useless bikes. Bicycle, wheel and so on. At some point, an accident occurs and one of the attackers is thrown off the bike, we see the bicycle (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents' car, but the rider has disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the rider and the bike return ... apparently unhurt by the accident. At this point, even if the machine has an explosive device planted in it, attackers choose to pull the agent while driving the past, then blow up the car. What has also been done clearly with cgi. Sound confused? It's, and so is the rest of the movie. I might emphasize that when I say CGI, we are not talking about Lord of the Rings type cgi here. We're talking about the cgi-type Rangers Power Rangers, I think it would have been better done on the Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd made this movie that I will never know, made for money, as a favor for someone or because they were blackmailed in it ... perhaps the last one.
