The story line undeveloped / unbelievable (until I realized where she was going, I did not care) bad casting (come ... William Macy as a hit man) Have we ever seen Tracey Ullman do that bad? ) (Did I have to think about what happened to John Ritter's inappropriate, incompetent, unattractive character?) Bad script ... (Seriously, I'm not looking for a formula script, but that was terrible) the only really good thing about it was the baby. Ten lines? Is not it okay if your comment is less than ten lines? Come on ... to whom are the rules? Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 rows ??? Is not that arbitrary? Why is it not good to have fewer than 10 comment rows?
