Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If he was a guy who deserves the gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. But how could Bill Corcoran have made such a bad film about Dan Jansen's incredible story, Dan Jansen's Story is truly incredible! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of an athlete everything is wrong, the way that Matt Keeslar and the other skaters, their technique, the dimensions of the fast speed oval, everything is wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserve better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
