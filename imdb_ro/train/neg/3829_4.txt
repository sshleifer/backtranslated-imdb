The Yuma train train army loses his freedom and launches the heads for the retired sheriff responsible for murdering his wife (as well as a hidden hidden gold that remains hidden from the screenwriter). The attempt to bring the Western genre to the point of the violence and brutality of the 1970s is not even in the same league with some of the new Westerns that have emerged since the 1960s. It's impossible to square and simple, with female characters just around as bag bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff returns to order, Charlton Heston gives one of the most impressive performances and less inspired performance (he has a good time, trying to read a letter and beat his glasses). James Coburn, as a half-breed race, is pretty much an autopilot, but Coburn has a way to turn even the most painful dialogues and situations into a messy and disturbing thing. It's his show to the end. * 1/2 from ****
