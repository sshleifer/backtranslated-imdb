I'm afraid I did not like this movie very much. Apart from some rescue graces, there is nothing to write about at home. J-horror exploded over the past five to six years, but the films themselves had more than one repetitive account and carbon copies of a previous success. This is one of them. Basically, this is a supernatural blood movie. The beginning is promising, with frozen scenes from a morgue in which a dead girl has her eyes sewn graphically, but as soon as she opens them. However, after that, it is quickly down for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be nice I will start with the things I like about 'Gawi'. On the plus side, the images are gaudy, and the movie looks great for its guy. For those who like horror movies, there are some nice scenes of crimes (without words). We also have some good suspense sequences / set-pieces. However, there are some drawbacks, too ... First of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot passes and jumps back and forth over time with an alarming intensity. Usually this is not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same, no matter their age, I was confused on several occasions. Performance is good. a little hard to say when you do not know the language), but it looks a little stiff. And for a horror movie, I do not think it was scary enough. For a while I was pretty bored. Being a fan of giallo movies, I was expecting a lot from Nightmare, but unfortunately I was rather disappointed.
