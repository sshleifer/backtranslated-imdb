Enough is enough ... sometimes you just have to stop filming based on a concept that is much dead. The first Tremors movie was great. The second was ridiculous. The third was nausea. The television series was terrible. And this film just drives deeper stakes. Virtually another excuse for cheap computer effects and dolls, we now have the series set in the Wild West in the 1800s, and they fight against the grabs. As a refreshing of the first one, he must learn how to beat them again. With some fun, I suppose. Otherwise, this direct-to-video version, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is just too far away. And I continue to wonder how there is never a record of these events that have taken place ... have they simply forgot to record this unprecedented event? I think something like that would be the historian, so our first-time friends would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this, which ruin the original, make me crazy. Avoid this trash.
