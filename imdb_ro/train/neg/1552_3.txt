This movie was very well published. I'm a film enthusiast and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical about how fun this movie was, my friends thought it would be great and suggested it to me. Then I went and saw her, I sank into my almost asleep seat until I remembered that I paid for this movie. I made fun of most of the stuff in the movie so I would not feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, and I wanted to get my money out of the movie! I always go into an open-minded film, I'm not trying to get into it with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen more movie previews or you like comedy very slow and corny you can enjoy it, but for true Id comedy fans say you pass. Maybe even check again The Kings of Comedy. Something told me to go and meet Me meet Parents!
