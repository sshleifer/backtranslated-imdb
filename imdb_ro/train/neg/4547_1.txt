The movie was TERIBLE !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in recent years. One of these films will be able to tell people for the next three years that this is the worst film I can think of. Thank you for responding to this burning question: "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Believe me ... I read the book, I enjoyed the message and I was pleased to see the movie, but then they treated the audience as if we were laughing. There is no story, and the story that is there is ruined by too much magic and coincidence. It is too bad to have to specify the nine prophecies and can not simply carry them in a story that is fun to follow. They did not spend any time in character development and it was easy not to care if someone died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who remained until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is pretty boring, but I liked the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while reading the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I suggest not to see if you want to continue to keep the words of the book close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
