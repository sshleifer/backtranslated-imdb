This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who says that acting is great and pouring is superb has not even seen mediocre cinemas. The actor is clearly terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I feel as if all the other "growing" comments had to be made by the people associated with the filmmakers. I was not very impressed with the story, but I just wanted to see a beautiful rural area in Oregon and there was decent cinema - but pouring was something inspired. I think this film also makes a mockery of the noble general suggestion that something deep in American culture has been ignored and probably lost and that its revival is also worthwhile. There are jokes in the wrong places and too clear and it makes me think it was written by the State Department or something like that. Back to drawing. To even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like Harold and Maude is totally retarded, and along the same line of begging and pretense and "joke" as in this film.
