The third installment of the Carnosaur trilogy features a bunch of Keystone Kops quality military orders that attempt to kill two Velociraptors and a T-Rex. I give her a simple sympathy and affinity for dinosaurs. The film is certainly the worst of the trilogy, really can not be taken seriously. Furthermore, however, watching this movie can not help you notice some interesting parallels between the Carnosaur and Xtro trilogies. The first installment in both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a classic cult, the second is a rival of "Alien", and the third is a mosquito, almost pale (whether intentional or not) movie that has you pray on the floor laughing. Also, like the Xtro franchise, all Carnosaur movies have nothing to do with them. They just called the franchise name to attract interest in "follow-up," I think. Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises, you're referring back and forth between the two.
