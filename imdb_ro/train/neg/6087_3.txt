This movie was not as much a chore as I waited for it to be. There are a few seconds of shine in this paranoia-fest somewhat idiotic conspiracy. Most of the act is mediocre, but quite typical of things in the 1970s, full of pregnancy breaks. A photographer and a model confess some strange things in the woods and soon become victims of the same starts. Flight plates are spotted, more people disappear - but are the extraterrestrials or the ultra-secret group of their own government of hidden types? Quite quickly, a reporter and a "UFO logist" (apparently modeled on the character of the director-director) are attracted to this unleashed fiasco and become the target of ultra-secret agents that are equally threatening that they are improbable and mindless. Then the fun really starts. The film, predictably, makes almost the same meaning as the UFO conspiracy's average theory, but it should be praised for taking it seriously. Working with the camera is OK for a low-budget movie, the pacing is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd, and there are issues of continuity that are fun to take care of. What are the seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Frankly, I can not tell you too much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is at least worth the quick if you can not take the middle.
