The big money machine has succeeded again! Disney profits profoundly from monsters like me who feel that we have to have every video (good or bad) stamped with Disney nickname. Why have I kept looking forward to these "sequels" that make Don Bluth on a bad day look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (an already poor choice!) Is not one of the most daring creations of Disney at least a linear story? Of these, only the latter comes anywhere near the quality of the animation and story I would expect. Music is atrocious and modern (that is, in 2 years it will be dated) and does not add anything to the story. Why does everything need to be updated? You know, the original design is still popular because of its weather, why not be respectful and respect the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can not wait for a Sleeping Beauty Continuation. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we will get Britney Spears inspired music! So, Disney, if you listen, remember that we are not all children without discrimination here. How about throwing a bone or two at fans who have been around enough time to know the difference between craft and nonsense?
