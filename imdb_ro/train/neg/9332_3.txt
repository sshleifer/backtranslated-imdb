It's not a terrible movie, indeed, and Glenn and Keitel are top actors. Moreover, I do an acceptable job with the very poor script. The landscape is lush, and the plot has some interesting twists. Moreover, I have the impression of why these actors and crew have made the film, are professional and are paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a movie and then do not release it for the theater audience? Even if a movie is a box-office flop, it certainly does some money. If you're a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or just watch it on television, just like I did. Granted, the film will not help solve the problem of immigration with Mexico, but the experience is far better than 90% of today's TV standard tariff.
