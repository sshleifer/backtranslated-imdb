If I knew this movie was filmed in the style of dogma 95 that caused exaggeration and starvation, I would never have rented it. However, I took a dramamine for malaria and I shot a shot. I took very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle. The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was pretty bleak, but at least the room was constant and did not breathe the characters' throats. time. I am embarrassed by the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas - he will be caught in America at the same time as the next leprous outbreak. (It's called Dogme 95, because it's the average number of times the actors hit the camera's eyes.) <br /> <br />
