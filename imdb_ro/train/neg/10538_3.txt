The First Power (1990) was a terrible movie that came out during the horror movie, made in the late 1980s / early 90s. I found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts. This movie does not have so much sense and credibility that it's not even funny. The rapid justice system in this movie makes Texas seem comparatively faint. Lou Diamond Phillips is overwhelmed in his role (playing a tough policeman), and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psychic role. Do not waste time with this because it's bad. Within a minute, I take it back. This movie makes an excellent movie. See the crucifix packing nun, has the most beautiful legs I have ever seen a nun who was not in a philosophy of Jesus Franco. Yew! <br /> <br /> This marked an end of an era for L.D.P. His star was stained and he could not fry in a bunch of garbage. It was D.T.V. for him until his "ressurection" a few years later. It is only recommended if you are desperate.
