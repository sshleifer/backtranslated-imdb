Remember Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you buy? Henry plays in each of them. I bought this movie believing it was the miniseries ... WHAT A LETDOWN !! It would have been a comedy, but the young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Is OK for Popcorn TV but was not credible in this movie (where was her English accent?) AND WHAT IS THE STORY OF LOVE ??? The film should have risen to the level of a young man in military power - not the captain of the slave ship juggle with the English little girl looking for her father ... If I had paid more than $ 7 for that movie, I should call police - because it would be a crime!
