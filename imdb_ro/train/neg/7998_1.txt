Not only was he invariably annoying to listen, but he had no joke. I swear, an American guy who says mother's jokes would have been more fun than Leary's crap. (Maybe funny for a few minutes, but I will even be able to laugh at least once!) Leary claimed to have stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... he seems to be still high on something; he was just some villains who were blamed, mostly drug-related. One of his jokes was something like, "I would not use crack, especially with the same name as my ass." - Man, how did he come with him ?! I swear the only guy who needs to close f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him lived. This guy's totally bad. If you are slightly amused by oath and "jokes", where you can come with yourself, then you waste your time with this junk.
