I am a great fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, she had problems in deciding whether it was a child or an adult that caused a strange adventure of adult storytelling and violent scenes with a little stray that continues to give "funny" moments to beginning. br /> <br /> But that's hardly important, the movie is simply boring, motionless and untouched by the original story. He just fails to transfer to the picture all the points that Orwell tried to do to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> The Second Revolution ?! Did not they learn anything? Who will be the next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
