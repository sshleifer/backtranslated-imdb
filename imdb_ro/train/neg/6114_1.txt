Because that's all he does through the whole movie, he's empty for no good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, she suddenly removes her clothes. When is a poisonous boa? How did Tarzan come in otherwise poisoned? This whole movie is cheated. They have failed to get the animal species for this movie correctly. With what an Orangutang hangs on these chimps? You must have lost the set of a much better film. Cannibal Men's Men's Group Why was Bo and her father painted if they were eaten later? Perhaps it was just an excuse for blades to show her breasts and curves again. His father, while hunting, is approaching and behaving stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to him. Any true African bull elephant who was not a circus would have overturned the moron's ass. Any intelligent hunter would start shooting the moment he saw it. And I can not be surprised if the camera was on LSD, because it continued to show different scenes that went slow, without any good reason. It did not make any sense. Boa constrictor that Tarzan fights in the water, looks like one of 12 Ft rubber screws that you can buy at a local Spencer Gifts. Tarzan was strange sp eechs in this movie, maybe Bo boasts so much. I'm sorry, but that's a rupture of a classic black and white film Tarzan, with a similar but better story. Not to mention the plot. I saw everyone forgot to say. The scene in which he tries to save Jane and his father is standing too close to a stream of flowing water. It made him seem to urinate someone from under him. He and Jane are also cheating on a beach, with perverted monkeys jumping and beating. Of course they did well for her father's death. * (The End of Spoilers) * There should be a general surgeon's warning on this film. seeing Bo stripped too much in this movie will make you blind.
