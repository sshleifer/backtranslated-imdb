Plan B has a fast-paced, unmeasured, undemanding scenario for a movie trying to get out for the actors involved - a trip that should have been established from the start. It's just a mafia-based comedy that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those who are participating. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the head of crime more preoccupied with clothing and appearances than with his control business. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is smarter than dirt, and his ignorance should be fun. Maloni killed one of his debtors (who is getting married to Franco Diane Keaton), and Maloni takes Fran as a nurse to work his dead husband's debt by being Maloni's "hit man". Fran is afraid of her shadow and is unable to perform Maloni's missions, choosing instead to transport them to "battles" in Florida to hide in his brother James's house until she figured out what to do in continuation. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! Completion is fully predictable, just like every line attributed to the character scenario. Diane Keaton has done a lot of fine movies and she is one of the most talented actresses and comedians, but here she shouts and stutters and overturns her way through a ridiculous part that gets quickly annoying to look. Paul Sorvino is well cast by Paul Sorvino from other mafia movies. The support is also allowed to play on the balcony in the broadest paper, which can be imagined. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just stupid and troublesome. Director Greg Yaitanes has to go back to TV sites: If this story has been compressed in a half-hour concert, it might have been a chance. Grady Harp
