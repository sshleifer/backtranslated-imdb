First of all, let me say that this must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing and I do not want to say anything in this movie is really thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and, as it progresses, you just want to end it! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" with everything they say, "More power for you"! On the other hand, I just want to have fun. What brings me back to this disaster, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that most of those here are also in agreement. Most of them did not make any sense, and until you think you have a scene that realized another tormented scene comes around ... and I think you'll see where this happens. Avoid, this is sucking ... bad!
