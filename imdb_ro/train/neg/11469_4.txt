ORCA is not really bad, but Richard Harris's most beautiful hour is not. As a demented fisherman, Ahab, Harris enters a deadly game with a killer killer whale after killing the "wife" and the unborn child of the whale. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. She criticizes them very much about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and ends somehow in the arctic struggling with the mad revenge whale. There are no special effects to talk about, except what looks like a round mirror for whale eyes - there are Harris' bright shots reflected in the eyes, so the public understands that the whale knows who it is. Bo Derek, one of Harris' crew members, had a particularly unpleasant run with Orca, and most of the support, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, do not act well.
