With a title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and the liberal aids of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay is considered a cut above the usual garbage that our British cinema creates. "Robert Carmichael" (in short) is a realistic study of youth alienation and, at the same time, seems to be a critique of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so obviously unrealistic and atypical - unlike the fetish imaginations of "extreme" filming, most adolescents are not drug rapists. As a critic of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - the subtext society affected this sensitive individual) is so infant that it can not bear thinking at all. There are signs of technical abilities, but some commentators have overestimated this. Like Kubrick and Noah, he shows that the desire for shock linked to alleged serious intentions may be the worst cinematographic concert of the recent film. People loved "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible," because they liked rape and violence, but especially loved to feel more culturally because they liked the things they hate most. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral director) here labels this as one of the most moronic movies for years. (I'm not against the violence in the movie, but it's really a hard trick - the people in the cinemas cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange," showing how Kubrick's alleged intention was missed by miles, free violence is much easier to accomplish, is less offensive than the claims of many art directors.)
