Comedy comedy comedy, which is supposed to fake the "classic" 50-year-old "alien invasion", but it's really no better than that, except, of course, in the pure technical department (good makeup effects). And any parody that is worse than her target is doomed to failure ("Casino Royale," "Our Flint of Man" is worse than almost any James Bond movie). After two hours of hearing the striking voice of strangers, you will be begged for peace and tranquility. (* 1/2)
