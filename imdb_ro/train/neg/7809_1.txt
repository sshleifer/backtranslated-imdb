Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is ruining around him. Cecil takes a phone book, looks for a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and talks about his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the Word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything better. Ahh ... if everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "movie" looks like it was done with about $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
