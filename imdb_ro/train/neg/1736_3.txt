Let me start by saying that I really like Betty Grable, especially from the "Argentine Way Down", but when she got to this disaster, she also had "around" and, frankly, the whole movie was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been quite desperate) the story was bad, the good colors and the movie too long. He had some of the old expectations that Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner would try to stimulate interest, but unsuccessfully. The musical score was terrible and I have to say that no song was memorable in any way ... as I was a Miss Grable fan, I would always want to never see it!
