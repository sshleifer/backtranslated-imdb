Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons to early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I have to confess that I never enjoy these films in particular and say the same about it.Jake West is a director who does not clearly have his own inspiration and choose to steal from the ones they are looking for. I lost the number of times when a great Hollywood film was most notably cited by James Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and gore on the show here is not funny, the end of the movie gets tired and maybe it would have been better than a short film. Poor actors, the direction is weak, and the plot does not exist. but others did the same thing much better than the one here. 4/10
