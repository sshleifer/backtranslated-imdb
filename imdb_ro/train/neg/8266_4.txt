What is * bliep * with this movie? Could not they write a better script? Everything is a "beautiful" movie, but ... it was done several times ... By the end I thought it was good, but ... returning to the last part ... * barf * So corny ... It was waiting for mother fairy god to appear ... but wow, it did not happen ... what is good. I liked Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a new movie in a new form with another child who wanted to be bigger / bigger; that's just so passe <br /> <br /> Just watch it until it's out on the TV. Do not get me wrong, but that's not all
