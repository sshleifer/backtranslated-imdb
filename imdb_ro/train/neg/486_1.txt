This move was a blow to me. I think small girls should aspire to be more than swimsuits, homeowners or mistresses, since it seems to be everything that will ever be portrayed. It's really sad to see how an artist's work and life are so unfairly misinterpreted. Unconsciously (or perhaps it should have been expected), Artemisia's entire character and everything it represented had been reduced to a Hollywood standard female character; a mournful creature, flawless, physically flawless, with no traits of character that brought him that place in history that was mutilated here. Worse, it was to see that much of the audience was less educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message transmitted in the film and reality. To describe the artist as a boyfriend with her real rapist, someone she actually accused her of violating her even when she was subjected to torture, I simply annoy me. If the director had nothing more to say that he should have refrained from basing his story on a true person.
