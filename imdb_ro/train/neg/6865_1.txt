This movie was so bad it was ridiculous. I could not resist watching him. The plot is a standard one, and the script is quite horrific (supporting the role of a neighbor and a friend of lawyers were better actors). Kind of fun if you have time to lose and you like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. Headliner playing "Kathy" was just fascinating, because I could not decide if her deadpan, flat affect was the result of a bad surgery or simply bad (I decided that both). This leaves the script to comment, which was quite terrible. Pat remarks, idiotic and silly decisions from all the characters in the movie. Perhaps this was so riveted; I do not know. I just watched it to see how bad it might be. (In fact, the dialogue does not even qualify to be called "cliche" - but it is almost completely ingenuous.) The worst, inexpensive film made, the sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) , without an art or a real connection with the action, more than the projects that were randomly chosen in action in a bad play A shooting scene would have been shot by any minor in the warehouse or in an old school: shot weak, cheap props, minimal action ... yet I wanted to see the end.
