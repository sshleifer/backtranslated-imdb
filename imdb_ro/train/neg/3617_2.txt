Indeed, really bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes asylum. Three years later he kills a professor of sociology, the end of the stage. A semester yesterday later (hey, that said the book title), a new sociology professor is at school. He makes friends with another sociology professor who works there and begins to meet another professor. Students were bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title books that indicate how long it has passed. The scenes are rather short and are cut in different characters elsewhere, which makes little progress. A lot of scenes involve characters walking and speaking, sitting and talking, and serving little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters always wear the same clothing. Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time, we ask: how long has that body existed? And at least one of the dead does not seem to have been missed by others. The killer manages to kill a person by stabbing her in the chest, another by stabbing him, and the other by splitting his forehead. His knife is poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The cover of the video cassette has a cheerleader: there is no movie in the movie. The back cover has a photo of a person in a graduation cap and a dress that threatens a group of women in a dorm room. The central blush of photography is in the film, but nobody ever wears such a suit and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one-on-one.
