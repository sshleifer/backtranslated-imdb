I've seen this for free, fortunately, and I wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to push for over the past ten years. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposed - and yet they are attracted to each other. If that line of plot does not take you by surprise and will not make you emotional, the movie will never be. > <br /> Many viewing gags and fart jokes. By the middle of the movie I started to realize that Ben Stiller is not that funny, but he's trying very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not that cute, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman would have had to pay a lot of money to be in this type of ho-hum movie, I've come to wait longer for them. that I saw this after seeing the American Splendor, a truly funny and original film - and I compared the two in my head and I realized that film directors would be forced to sit through the two films back - that would make sense in them and begin to make better movies with strangers, rather than those formulas that play best on planes.
