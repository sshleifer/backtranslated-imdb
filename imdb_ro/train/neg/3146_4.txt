the author of the book, with the same title, should not have let his name be used for this film. if you read the book, this film has a liberal interpretation of the real events in the book and its spirit that the film and the book seem to have little in common except the title and superficial details. the film adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the literary achievement of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only the plot moves at an incredibly slow pace, it does not offer anything more as it moves slowly (for example, character development, for example). some viewers may be entertained by some of the lesbian graphic love scenes later in the movie, but you might be looking at a special show for the things they present in therese and isabelle - quite tainted and not imaginative at all.
