When a movie like "Dukes of Hazzard" brings over $ 75 million, it makes some incredibly sad statements about the state of our society. Whether we are colleagues too stupid to stop garbage like this, or maybe I do not understand how many people will use this garbage effortlessly. Hollywood had no reason to make good movies, because if it removes trash then people will see it anyway, because there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I left despite getting a free movie. Dialogue could not be great. The waterfalls could not be more than scandalous. Perhaps this "bigger and bigger" image is addressed to the Texans, but they do not appeal to me or anyone in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this career-ending film, except for Burt Reynolds, who says all you have to hear. Jessica Simpson - does not make me laugh. I would not recommend this movie for the movie, even if you were desperate. It was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening the day to match or do better than it cost through marketing. They did despite the fact that the public was warned. Stupidity abounds.
