If I write a review of a movie, maybe it will stick to me ... but in general I expect that I will forget that I have seen it only after two weeks. So why bother? Because again I find myself looking at a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I did not expect to be able to stay in the room while on the road. It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... not a comedy of errors that always makes me wander. It was just a sweet puff ... and if you can not take it, stay with the boys in the locker room. I agree with those who defend this film because it is certain that they will meet their target demographics and that it will not be a total burden for an adult. Gives some good chicks here and there, a side splitter. Sure it's silly and just fun, but at least does not suck (as many have said it does). Maybe those people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to qualify on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually a good score in my book. Give him a sense of 4 and he will support his rating at the time of this writing. By offering him a number of 1 or 10, as most have done so far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. I can not believe how powerful people feel in one way or another about this look to forget (or even bother to write about it). I missed something? <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel, often written in b'ch roles, does not disappoint when her character receives it. You might recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, although his role is auxiliary. Of course you can lose it if you are an adult. But if there is a pre-adolescent girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared not to hate it (you could really enjoy it).
