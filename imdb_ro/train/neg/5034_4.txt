I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film as well as some reviews that have to be positive. I saw the movie and it was quite disappointed. I did not look very good at all. It was slow and has no entertainment value. Even crime scenes are unclear, with real knee-length pictures that do not look good at all. And the supposed end of the big twist is not really too big, I saw it coming, and then the end seemed just a cliche. This movie may not be mentioned much, but with the little one it receives, it is overestimated. I would not recommend this movie.
