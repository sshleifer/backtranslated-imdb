Now, it would be kind of a clich if I start with the little title, so I'll wait for that. First of all, this film made me wonder why the kids are doing stupid things, such as wandering in labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized, it is a movie with a message, the message is beaten by children and things like that will not happen. Things like what you ask? Things like a giant instable monster that grows and causes a little chaos before you die in the typical way "kill the monster indirectly". Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing blue in it and no simian of any kind. Now you mumble like I was deceived or something else. The image on the cover had a giant / crab / idiot / bug on the front, casting a few nurses screaming. That's what happened, but I wanted monkeys! I just enjoyed the biggest prize a few nights before (half drunk on Cask and the cognac of the cream you lied) I was in the mood for more 80 hijacks of monkeys. Not so much. If you like snowy monkeys or blue stuff this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids, rent it.
