I totally agree with the review by a vendor of the variety that the film is never so funny, lively or visionary about the creative process that his premise seems to guarantee. The narrative is messy and enlightenment is indeed problematic. If the film should be character-driven, poor illumination does not enhance acting and sometimes it is difficult to see the actors' facial expressions. Many Africans outside the South will have difficulty tracking the English language spoken in the film, and some of the local humor will be lost in this process. We watched the film at Cape Town's World Cinema festival last year. The comments and reactions of the film ranged from unreported and negligent to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of Southwestern New World, but some of the remarkable films about the history of apartheid will really be among the best in our 110-year film history. It is not surprising that the film disappeared from Cape Town cinemas only two weeks after its release and from most of Durban and Gauteng cinemas. It has a clear limited appeal among the public in South Africa.
