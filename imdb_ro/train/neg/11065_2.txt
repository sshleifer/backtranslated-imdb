This movie had so much potential. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows there is so much detail that he overlooked in this movie is ridiculous. Too much time and effort has been spent in the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and alcohol consumption. Where was the character's development? The origins of every villain are always interesting, and Dahmer has not made an exception. Where the film refers to adolescence when it started killing and mutilating small animals? Instead, we have a series of dizzying flashbacks that try to explain the killer's origins, but they fail to address the major point in Dahmer's development. Also, the reason why the country became so interested in this story was the details - how it kept the bodies in its apartment and the lengths and measures it had taken to accomplish that; cannibalism and his desire for meat etc. I can continue, but to sum up, too many points left in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough gore - the good things you would expect to see when the title of the film is "Dahmer."
