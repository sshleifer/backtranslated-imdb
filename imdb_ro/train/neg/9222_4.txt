I really love the sexy and SF-SF action movie of the 1960s and the actress who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these movies and it does not matter if they could act (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this film was that it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has a SF sci-fi movie called "Dragonfly" being done and the director is fired. Thus, the producers decide to let a young aspiring director (Jeremy Davies) complete the picture. I'm a real beautiful woman in Dragonfly, but she's just in her. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's exploits from his early days and stages him. I want the movie to have been a tribute to those early movies. It could have a lot of cameo actors who appeared in them. There is an actor in this movie that has been popular since the sixties and the law of John Phillip (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I'll have to wait for a director to pay tribute to the movies of the sixties. If anyone reads this, "Do it as sexy as you can!" I will be waiting!
