The film has the longest, most tortured and agonized end of any movie we've seen for a long time. Unfortunately, it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones gives such a wooden performance, I was surprised that he did not go flames when he approached the candles in the movie. I do not really remember the other films he made (a blessing I have to believe.) Never criticize the performance of the actors because there are too many things in the movie that can affect them, but in this case it is so as a matter of fact, stands out from the ATROCIOUS scenario, given that she gave him lines and situations where Meryl Streep would have problems, but I swear she sometimes reads a nail book on the set, and else I have believed to be able to learn handicapped or slow in some way, REAL, plotting, dialogue and pacing are just as bad as you, but there is no excuse for this show or for the director who let her it was committed. a small Indian club / breakfast went into a rounded burrito, then regurgited by a school director and a director. Take this back with Studio exec crayola everywhere.
