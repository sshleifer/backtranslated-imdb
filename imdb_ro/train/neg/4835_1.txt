Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel to a young US captain in Afghanistan. It also happens to be a highly qualified surgeon and walks around Kabul, which operates NATO soldiers. In a particularly difficult task, he usually takes a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 meters. He is then eventually promoted to the sergeant, but is unable to decide between a career as a sniper and surgeon, so he withdraws from the army altogether. A year later, frustrated by civilian life, she joins Nana, and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.
