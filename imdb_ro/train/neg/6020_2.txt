I like the end-of-day movies. I like movies B. I was hoping to like this movie. We could ignore the bad effects, the often atrocious music, the lines that cause the overturning. I could ignore the inexplicable events and the fact that the film is constantly based on deus ex machina is excuse given the subject. We could ignore the fact that people who struggle with hunger and try to get to world peace are bad boys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's simply boring. Nothing is actually happening; almost all of the scenes in the film are designed to push the makers of movie makers to the audience with the price of having a coherent story or suspense. If you are looking for a B-movie fun, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
