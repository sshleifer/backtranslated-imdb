I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 on that. The only quality of redemption is the scandalous gore. Doubling was worse than any of the experiences I've ever had. Looks like he was shot with a VHS video camera. I think every pfennig has been spent for special effects, because there were lots of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to admit abundant gorons that were not as disgusting as it could be because the whole movie is so stupid and unbelievable
