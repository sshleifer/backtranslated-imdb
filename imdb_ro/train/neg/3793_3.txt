The nutcracker has always been a ballet somewhat problematic. It has little to do with ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based. In the ballet, the story is essentially overtaken by the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the UK from sweets to watch a series of character dances. There is an infinite variety of scenic productions that re-interpret the story in countless ways (not always successfully) to offset the poor ballet libretto. > <br /> The Balanchine version has no sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is a great drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful music). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party, where nothing happens and where even the dancing (little of which) is not particularly memorable. The over-active pantomime, especially from Drosselmeier, which might seem acceptable on the stage, looked badly filmed for the big screen. Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Sweets Kingdom (Act II in the stage version). Although there are some choreographic subjects, most choreography is poor and uninspiring. Surely this is not a vintage Balanchine. Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as a narrative ballet creator. Watching this movie version of his stage production of Nutcracker just reaffirmed this vision.
