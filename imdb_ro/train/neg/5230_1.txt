Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are asinine and amateurish and not too funny if you are not a 14-year-old boy with a sense of underdeveloped humor. <br /> <br /> It is not definitely famous, as its immature fans would like you to believe, by harassing people at Wikipedia or filling ratings here at IMDb. Surely, he was not profiled by any of the major media that speaks volumes about his "fame" and his creation. Benfer has a limited animation ability, but he has to move away from his youngsters and learn to write funny stuff before being taken seriously as a true entertainer. From this moment, however, he is just a child with a camera, and looks.
