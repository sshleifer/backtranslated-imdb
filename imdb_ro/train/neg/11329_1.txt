Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all, and she was just her annoying, unrestrained habit in this film. That was before it became so fat, but it still seemed very short and weird. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict, but clearly an actor with a wider range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to make his way through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and takes too long. The actors were too young and light, and neither of them aged convincingly because of the poor makeup. Hudson seemed ridiculous only to be eliminated, and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
