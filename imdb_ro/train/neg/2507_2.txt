This is not a good movie. It's disjunctive, all acting is bad, and it has an agonizing story that you've seen for a thousand times done much better elsewhere. Not to mention that you can see every plot point that comes a mile away. Worst of all, nobody bothered her to tell Lonette McKee that she could not sing. But who cares, it's very good. But I can not do anything new here. The hot girl group gets the advantage, some get stuck with drugs, someone gets stuck with a guy, some gets fucked up and then horrible things happen. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the music industry. I can not believe that so many people think it's a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to classifying black movies. Do not play this! If you want to support these movies by visiting them - great! If you liked it - super! Each of them. But do not try to tell me it's okay. Pleeeease! I want the colorful people not to feed on these movies just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the Purple color. These would be great movies, no matter the skin color of the actors. Why? Because they have been telling convincing stories with great action, that made you feel a little after you left the theater. Just because our experience does not automatically make a good movie. It's good only when it's okay. Period.
