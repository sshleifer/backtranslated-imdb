Liongate does not need to be proven yet. Every movie from lionsgate was absurd. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities and just keep me always and fast. And Cabin Fever is certainly an exception. I could not even be careful at most of this movie was so frustrating and bad. Guy cuts the dead dog for some reason. He becomes infected with a random virus, transfers his children to a camp, the children begin to get infected and die, the city learns about it and rather than help them, kills them. then the water is infected and everyone dies. end. <br /> <br /> Really, that's all the movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely retarded, you do not care about any of them and the baby is left with the boy meets the world. My friend and I discovered that talking about how fat and scrupulous our classmate was to be more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie. We've done everything to the end while banging $ @ t bulls, because this movie will make you do that. And I'm still confused by the random moves of the slow-moving karate movements at random and how it seems that everyone in the country is completely retarded and hicuşoară. And again, why did this dog attack the girl? why did he try the child they were trying to kill to sit in a chair waiting to kill him? who was part of the plan of the two? Wow. the best plan. I can not believe that this film has received a theatrical release. we could hardly stomach the DVD, not to mention staying in a theater that did not move for an hour and a half. It was not scary or funny or cool or something else. it's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could use to ... do not know, plant a tree or something. is more productive than this piece of garbage. The actors, the special effects and the script are a joke. never raise this. <br /> <br /> The fever of the cabin becomes an ugly leg racket scene, out of 10
