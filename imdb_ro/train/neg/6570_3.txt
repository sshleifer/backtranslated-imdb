I did not find Charley Chase very funny, even though his character on the screen sometimes remembered by John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Hen Broon from Scotland's "Sunday Post" comedy page.) In Chase's best movies, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I give Chase a credit that his best movies - such as "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wood Wedding" - inspired a fandom that is firmly loyal to him ... but I'm sure even the one the hottest fan Chase will agree that "Married with Order" very early and very brutal is not at all funny. Chase - eager, weird, gormless, naff - is a young swain hoping to pronounce at Fair Rose. Oliver Hardy offers the best performance in this movie as her father, who despises Chase as a "mollycoddle." Leo White, who has made a more notable work as a Chaplin sheet at Essanay, is here as a rival. There are some actions involving an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the headlines: is this a prime example of product placement? Unfortunately, a major flaw in "Married with Order" is the distribution of Rosemary Theby as Rose: it must be a standard issue, but Theby - with her chest - is physically wrong for the role. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but it was never a credible idea. The film historian William K Everson has done a lot of it in one of his film books. I'm going to evaluate "Married to the Order" just 3 out of 10, and I'm charitable ... because I keep guessing that Charley Chase has got something that everyone else gets, but I'm missing it.
