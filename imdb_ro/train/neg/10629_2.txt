The only reason I failed to record this is that Sibrel shows that he is the technical follower of making a film. It's a technically experienced film. That being said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are easily despised. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques for bashing the space program, rather than reality. And Sibrel's incontestable proof that landings have been falsified is easily rejected if you know anything about orbital mechanics. I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, watch it at google video for free. Do not let Bart Sibrel take advantage of your curiosity.
