Hood of Dead Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then one night, Rick's brother is shot by a street leader who fought with him earlier. Desperate, Rick calls his scientist to bring the latest formula they have worked on, which brings health to the blood cells. The formula was not tested on a man or even a corpse, but Rick is determined to bring his brother to life. It gives the body a double dose of formula, but nothing happens. So, Rick calls 911 and the body is removed only to return to life and feast on human flesh. Now, Rick has to find his zombie brother before the whole hood is turned into a death row. Hood of the living dead is a piece of garbage. Complot is a direct hit of Resident Evil, the act is just horrible, especially with Rick's fake crying for his brother, the weapons are so fake, every time the gun is triggered, it sends the sparks and the make is just blades. Only false blood is covered over the faces of the actors. Zombies are also altered. They run, they grow mad and they have to be shot in the heart to die! Zombie should just mix, die and need to be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible, going out is the only good moment of this movie. Hood of the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, a bit of entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low-budget tour.
