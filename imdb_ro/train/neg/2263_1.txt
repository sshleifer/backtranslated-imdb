Okay, let me just say I did not expect a movie with Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all we asked was to be cinematic ... and that was not it. It looks like home movies of bad people. Stupidly, scripted and filled at the edge of the nudity of the most unattractive people I've ever seen. "The plot" focuses on a low-class family who decides to go to the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss more problems between a mother, a daughter, a stepfather, and her daughter's fianc√©. From there, the film fires and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. Are there any red sex, interactive sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to get out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and America's working class should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased, however, he did not squander his stardom movie attempt. It was smart, fun and entertaining) MY GRADE: F + (the daughter was hot)
