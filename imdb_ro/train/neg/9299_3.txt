While watching this movie, I tried to figure out why they bothered to do it. Although the movie's main movie is potentially good, there are all kinds of unnecessary / unnecessary subplots. Hollywood marketers must have dictated the most wicked, perpetual bicyclists and the man and woman who are getting too close and having sex. It's weird to see that more people have sex than I did from the president and the mistress. Many plots and subplots make the movie too wide and none of the characters are developed properly - I really did not feel I knew a character except that everyone was corrupt and bad. The end is completely incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what could have been, but what it was supposed to be. Finally, there is no explanation as to why anyone is doing what they are doing, except that they serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double cross. I am surprised that so many established actors (and good) have agreed to make such an empty film. This seemed like a movie made by students working on the second or third project. Do not waste your time unless you are in a movie class and want an example of not doing when making a movie.
