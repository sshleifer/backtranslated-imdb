When I was at school, I made a movie about a couple walking in the trees and talking, and I realized that halfway was not just a faulty aesthetic strategy, but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: the married lyricism married to a holiday, burden states on social comment. But whatever the failures of my movie, I feel much better after seeing ... this ... thing. In a way, mine ran for 20 minutes, not 85, and had more thanks to this: every futile beating here is dressed for four, five, six minutes without end. The masculine leadership is incredible, a fearsome creep, full of noises, given by the dramatic class improvisation bursts of philosophical intuitions taken from the U pub, and is given a lot of space to make us hate it. Of course, if he were not such a hole, then the third act would become even less meaningful, as a couple of headaches seem, to offer distant and completely useless echoes of "exploitation" values; but it's not easier to watch "tilt" while closing the magazine. I return what I said about BORN SEX, who had at least the courage of his own wrong lecture: this cinematic crater is and will remain the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I hope so much.
