This movie was bizarre, completely inexplicable and hysterical about looking at friends while drinking in a big house. I really like opening things with Lisa wandering about lost in a wonderful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in an exotic European locality, though perhaps not in a horror movie. Indeed, define the end in which there are strange sexual scenes that were not sexual (in my DVD copy). Do not try to understand it, just go and watch them for strange bits ... which is all. Do not follow this if you really want a plot or a characterization or something else to make sense. Pretty beautiful, though you can give up this and decide to watch a real horror movie, as they say, Dead Alive.
