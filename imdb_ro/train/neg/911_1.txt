This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. It's embarrassing that such an evil scenario has been allowed to become a movie and has been featured in cinemas since 2006. I have never seen so many sponsored products in the same movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why so many known actors actually thought the idea was even visible in a movie like this one. If I had any respect for a few actors known in this movie before I see the movie, it is now certain. <br /> <br /> I have heard that there will be a movie watching this movie and I do not understand how this is possible.
