I read reviews that apparently must have been a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand this. Perhaps it is true, if so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* ALERT SPOILER ************** ************* ************* The end has almost the same meaning as all children who are anti-government and anti-corporations without having a better solution that does not launch society into a Mad Max type . Yes, the main characters could go, but no. The reasons for this do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What it should mean to shoot a bunch of innocent people is never explained or even disregarded. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, perhaps even the only revelation that any of the characters in this film have and does not make any sense. Characters who go into a crime syndicate do not fight the institution, they just kill people. I thought he would use all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end that would have made more sense but they did not. - This movie is a teenager's dream to fight the authority that disturbs them, though they really need it. It has no moral, symbolic, no meaning; this movie simply plays the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that annoys you. If you think a crime / school shooting similar to columbine technology or virginia is a rational and sensitive way to deal with teachers and institutions you do not like, then I think you like this movie. If you are like me and you work to make a life instead of being blind (very blind in this movie) rebelling against "man," this movie is wonderful and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in parts that funding was missing, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder. On the whole, this seems to be a very rough outline of what might have been good film, but no effort is put into dialogue, character development, or moral, so it's just ... badly done. If ... I could only take two hours back.
