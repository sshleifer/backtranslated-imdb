A question for you: A family is going to a new home and being chased by demonic forces. What movie are they talking about? Every horror film you've seen? Yes, that's true, but it's not the answer I'm looking for. I will restrict him by saying that there are lots of teenage scenes. Does not it help you? Well there are a lot of bits in which the characters are followed by a creature and you see the characters through the POV of the creatures. Not before? Okay, is there a dream sequence involving a lot of blood? It could be any horror movie you say. Oh, I think this could take weeks, so I'm going to say that the film talks about the features of Ausia, many of which have appeared in NEIGHBORHOOD and SOMETHING. Yes, the movie is CIRCULAR THREE (also known as CUBBYHOUSE) and understand what the above exercise means? It's about me, underlining how CIRCLE THREE is not absolutely different from any horror film that has been done
