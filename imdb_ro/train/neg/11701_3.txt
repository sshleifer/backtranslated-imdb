Another example for which Stepehn King's books should not be made in movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in adaptation from the book to the screen.) The premise of this story revolves around a greedy attorney, always on a diet that accidentally kills an old cigarette woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the head of the local police, he goes down, even if the accident was a guilt, because he did not pay attention while driving. The dead Gypsy father gives a curse on 3, and our main character, Billy (lawyer), gets thinner and thinner than a day. Although the film has kept with the book, for the most part and has the typical end of the king, the act was crushed and forced. We have moved from one scene to another without too many things between them, as readings in a play. The king himself made a movie cameo (like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should only remain the same: authors. Let the actor show up. Not that someone in this movie was great. I saw the major characters in the movies, where they were much better.
