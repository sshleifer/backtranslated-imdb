I hired this movie waiting a few laughs, I really hope to be amused, but I was very wrong. This film showed very little humor, and pathetic jokes pushed me shamefully to ever hire me ... By touching a 10-15 year age group, this movie will let viewers outside of these borders feel dissatisfied. It does not deserve more than 3 highly recommended votes for anyone who does not want to lose 2 hours of their lives.
