"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - the social elite hangout and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character based on a current Studio employee from 1977 to 1982. The film's problem is that everything is brilliant, style and no substance. It is trying to be a really dirty and probable satire, such as "Boogie Nights", but eventually it meets like a lower wizard. Mike Myers has an ingenious task to play on the owner of the cocaine club Steve Rubell. It's just an easy comedy role, and if it were Myers's best attempts to slip into the drama that Lemmon and other comic actors did during their time, it's a total failure. "54" could have been insightful and exciting, but instead is just another bad teen movement, which is not fun or even remote employment. See your own danger.
