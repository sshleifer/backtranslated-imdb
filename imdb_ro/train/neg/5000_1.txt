This is probably the worst excuse for television programs because, oh, I do not know what's going on now? Nothing has ever happened in this ridiculous "series". Even though it's mainly shot by Britney and Kevin himself, you do not get good details in your personal life. For the most part, they just do nonsense, talk about noise and act like white trash. Look, I love Britney's music just as much as the next babe, but this show is just for a nation so dependent on Britney that they watch their foot clip (yes, this could be a real episode). I thank God that these two parted, because they were boring together. This show is TOXIC!
