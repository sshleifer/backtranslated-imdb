Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is he has no advantage of his own title! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other or two. In addition, we are never sure whether the main character in the movie is a vampire DEFINITIVE. One might argue that he is trying to "tune" or make him "realistic" but ends up boring. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. Scenes that take place anywhere else can not boast too much. Also, there is no clear antagonist and finally you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I would say that for a low-productive movie, the soundtrack was surprisingly adequate and instrumental (either with original scores or with music elsewhere). <br /> <br /> It's all for independent movies, but it does not look like this has ever been intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than the scarecrow killer."
