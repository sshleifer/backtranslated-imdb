No matter how well he understands his "message" - this movie is a great job to do - terrible action, a blade job - I do not know why Carr agreed to try to get a stutter - it's stupid. You will watch DVD extracts and how it has a camera around him - he just soaps it up - he loves being the focus of attention. He's a bad actor - reminds me of another attractive actor - Eric Schaffer. Some of Carr's presentation of this film to the youth centers in the city and New Age churches - where accused people looking for reinforcement and attention crawl about the way the film has touched and maybe made it - but, as a film itself, syrupy.
