The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never looked at a history book, but they still give a cheaply produced war movie for taking a long look at the role of black soldiers in the World War II. br /> <br /> The action is confusing and unbelievable - any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the distribution is interesting. Seeing New York, Giant Rosie Greer deserves the money I paid for it. Art Direction is the fifth rate - men wear Korean uniforms of war and the weather was bad enough until the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, it does not sound the way it looks here and I do not think the land looks like North California. The scenario never explains why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice note that some of the men who carry Springfield rifles instead of the M-1, which they probably should have released to second-rate troops. This idea of ​​a basic story (a racist officer in the south commanding black troops) should have expanded into a large budget production at that time and not too late to try it now. You have to take that for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film to make this effort. I remember seeing this some time ago and believing it was established in Italy, which would have made more sense because in 1944 there were black troops there.
