This is the high-quality cheese price of B film kung fu. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick moments and close our eyes and if you read at a right angle at a certain time of day during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You'll be amazed at how the splicing of the movie is not very good, but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, even if his character should be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very dumbass). You see Bruce goes one to one with the lion cow. Prosecutor's office stopped by Kay-Bee, you see. Also, Bruce finds nothing wrong with the wild beating of an injured man. Towards the end, the director decided to "throw a retrospective" for a scene shown 3 minutes ago! Perhaps they thought that only micro-organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
