Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen. They tried to do this by giving them "we know we do this" routine. That would have been funny if it had not been that "The Simpsons" had already done so. And he still would not act if he came up with the idea first. Flashbacks took place as part of the fantasy of the usual character (mainly J.D). Flashbacks were not really real events that took place, just compilations to say, J.D fall over or, I do not know .... Elliott fell over. If I wanted to see a Scrubs compilation, I would go to YouTube and not lose half an hour of my life. Scrubs have fallen into the trap that most sit-com has to do, and disappointing they have managed to go 5 and a quarter of the season without such an episode. <br /> <br /> We hoped the scrumps should not be that kind of sit-com. And, just as thoughtful, why the hell was the bald doctor.
