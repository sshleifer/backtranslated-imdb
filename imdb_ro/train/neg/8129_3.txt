I sometimes try to try to be charitable to all the B movies in Z degrees, but from time to time a certain movie tests only your patience until you want to palpate everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "Live By Night") is just such a movie. You can not look at this without thinking that it should have been an episode in the "Night Galley" and none of the best. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is bitten by a bat and therefore begins to turn into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (In fact, you thought if he turned into a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes near the bucket, but because it is a terrible, terrible movie, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has grand-mal convulsions at the feet of a hat and episodes of black every night, his friend and doctor, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists he only has an allergic reaction to rabies. Meanwhile, the most unpleasant and stereotypical county sheriff suspects that she is responsible for the brutal killing and brutal abuse of several local girls (and a wino). Meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that the refusal is a river in Egypt and, alternatively, she patronizes him and devours him for distraction. <br /> <br /> It is not so much that the act is bad - you can say that actors make professional choices and try to bring a juice and life to the script, even to the one who plays it on the sheriff. (Okay, it's pretty bad, but it's bad in a clisic, wooden, professional). Just as everything about acting, how the scenes, costumes, dialogue, script, and story line are in general, arranges your teeth on the edges and makes you want to bore everybody. <br /> <br /> I think the film had a chance but to be a small, scary, anxious favorite, but: 1) The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed with ACT and not just Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also had to find a script that would have a lower sense of the entire "Bat Bites Human, Who Turns Into A Bat" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a bit more physically for business in the scene for his "episodes", instead of resorting to the page "Man has a confiscation" The Golden Book of Mannerism acting in the style of Clich√©d. <br /> <br /> 4) He needed to restore the whole character of the "wife", make it smarter, less strident and more careful. <br /> <br /> I would never forget this movie voluntarily, except with the help of Mike and Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a bad, humorous or interesting way. However, better than "Battle Earth" or "World of Waters", however.
