This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not quite frightening, so I already knew I'd be bored throughout the movie. Of course, there were frightening things in the hotel room, but I did not see anything. I think I did not like it, because I thought too much overturning occurred; has become old and repetitive. I also did not understand if all the things Cusack had experienced in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that have taken place. The movie is headed and when it's over, you want to continue because you still wait for someone to tell you what it was about the movie. What I liked was the special effects. Besides, there was not much joy. Maybe just me, but I thought this was below average.
