the only thing pleasant about this extremely clear film is playing "guess" that location. What landmark in Toronto will be for the American / International location. Who knew the antichrist was Russian? obviously it can not be American, since we need jargon to save the day - Oh Buck ... you will tell us all the truth ... you will show us the light ... and the way out of the building the wicked anti-christers They are making their way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they do not do anything else! We do not have to pray.
