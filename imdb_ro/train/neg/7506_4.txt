Good actors and good performances can not mask an unnecessary scenario, a stupid dialogue, and behavioral patterns that sneak into what interests you. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, only suffering without a reason, teaches us nothing and we do not even bother to have fun.
