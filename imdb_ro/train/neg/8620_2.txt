I was not sure Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the "Malibu Express" movie hit. With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Sidaris is a serious director and not just a single-shot director. The story written by Sidaris, which was ungraciously issued by the Academy, is a complex scenario involving many invisible ups and downs. The main composite characters work for a sex-based radio station, known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret office. In "Fit to Kill," they face their unhappy Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most respected diamonds. A well-written script is not everything, a great action from the distribution helps to ensure this movie as a classic cult. Panned by critics and box office, this movie will be appreciated in the coming years. Now she suffers the same fate as Orange Clockwork and Taxi Driver, but in the future she will undoubtedly become recognized. I am disappointed that no critical circle recognized Andy Sidaris's shooting. Costumes, special effects, all contribute to completing this already beautiful film of filming. You may feel the best to ignore the negative rating 3 on this movie and rent it yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the Runaway Bride bride, and the action is better than or equal to the cinematic masterpiece "The Last Action Hero". Andy, keeps good work.
