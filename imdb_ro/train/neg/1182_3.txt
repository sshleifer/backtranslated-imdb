This movie is a bit more than a porno porno porn, and this says a lot about similar nonsense that was made at that time. This has been recommended by my friend as a "unique movie experience". He was right. I suppose he meant to say that like a joke. Not disgusting, not even shocking. Only mediocre actions and weak attempts at the art of shock. A bit of value in the camp, though I do not think the producers of this movie intended it. And yes, as a previous commentator mentioned, there is sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not spend too much money on this. Try borrowing it if you need to see it. Or contact me, I'd be happy to sell you my example for half the price. I'll probably have to see another director's film, because he seems to have a certain number. But if it is, I will regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever.
