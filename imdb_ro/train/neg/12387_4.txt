Lipstick is another glossy film failure. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie and I have trouble coming up with something. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway wore at the end of the movie was the best part. The script and the script were not the worst I've ever met, but it could have been a lot better. The lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to see. The sets were very glossy and nice to look at the cast. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the whole movie. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon lose his time in this regard.
