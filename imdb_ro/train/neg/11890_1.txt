From the first time I saw the box cover and the stretched film, I thought this guy, Scwarz's boyfriend, should be like 6 feet or 2 feet. <br /> <br /> It is not 5 meters tall. That's not his fault. <br /> <br /> At any rating, I activated the movie on a cold evening in Tucson, on the second floor with a good cigar and I let it roll. At that time, my wife had an affair, and things went down for me, so I needed a good diversion. But as bad as the movie ... I enjoyed her with a bottle of Merlot, I could admit. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I watched this movie several times. It always makes me feel good! It's not like "try too hard" to be cool or "it's so close" to hit the mark for an action movie ... It's frenetic. And then really clueless. Then frenetic again. It's the best of the best when it comes to a low-speed scene. Wow !! I've never felt safer in my life. And warm and happy. I was grateful that they conserved gasoline during the pursuit due to low production in the summer months ... the direction was "uninspired" the actions and sequences of battle needed to be choreographed or re-choreographed and tightened, the sound was out delivery did not hit you, continued simply goes, vice versa. The "locals" in the village where they were, rather, the city, were "courageous" also did not seem to follow what had happened very well, would look and even look "in the room's objective. Like a deer in head light kind of work only some of them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because "Columbu" I bet he has a good heart and a thoughtful spirit both for the people of America and for his fellow countrymen. <br /> <br /> However, the "island of Baretta" is very lethargic and unbelievable. Even now I really like it. Now my wife hates her, but I like it! <br /> <br /> Funny thing is, I'm pretty discriminating when it comes to movies that I like or even 'love'. Generally, I like Franco. That's how it is. <br /> <br /> As a movie that adds an addendum to this, if you like to kill a few hours of really fun watching, directly to B movie or bad movies for your small library collection then , if you can find (1991) with Robert Z 'But ... you know the big guy in "TANGO & CASH". "Big Sweat", a bomb story of a policeman without a real discovery of plot and action that is so disgusting, could also be "on crutches", and at the end "Big Sweat" money, because they had a picture of the play and put it on fire and let it burn during the credits. -Fun. <br /> <br /> But totally not as good as Baretta's Island, I gave it a "1" and a total "terrible" rating for the B-great movie. I look forward to the continuation, maybe "Baretta's revenge on Montazuma" (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and then falls ill on the water, declare war on the water) or "the Baretta's powder war" where he is a great drug master in his country a chemical combination of the gene and create a super-hybrid insect that would have grown and thrown into the cocaine fields and eaten the coke, and after passing it through the bug, pure coconut powder. Then another sequel should have made young people saved from excessive sugar dependence and so on. He could get an important toothpaste company to support and partially fund the project with careful product placement in this function. Right?(*)
