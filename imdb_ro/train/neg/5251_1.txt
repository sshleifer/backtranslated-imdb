This self proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. The lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, abilities, humor ... repeats the same situation again and again. It does not show the evolution of the character. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content and adds anything new to the psycho-criminal sub-genre. So blades should be shown at film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first film. BTW where hell is "talent"? there are scenes that were shot almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more master photos and it is terrible enough to see action jumping from one master to another without a reason. The device almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. The actors playing the main role play the role of amateurs, and the supporting piece is hardly credible. There are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one) ... A truly daunting movie, and any talented director.
