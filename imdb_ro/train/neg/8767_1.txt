Is this movie ??? Is that the Indians trying to look? I think this is an additional effort made by a sick director to overthrow Pakistani soldiers and, in fact, the country ... but what we, our pagans, know we are always ahead of India in every part of our lives ... only in weapon consoles. Well ... this film is badly filmed like Border at the beginning of 1997 ... and the director and writer just tried to overcome a shame in Kargil defeat by Pakistani armed forces, movies like these. One thing is very clear ... Whenever there is a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta tries to make some good movies instead of movies like this
