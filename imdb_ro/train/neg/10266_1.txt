He watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over 70-year-old horror movie presumed to be Friday, 13 (version 1 by any). Can not I think of many redemptions here except (or can I think of something?) The story revolves around a crowd of fools who listen to a radio program a year after some children were killed in the woods as a "homage" to that, it is supposed. But, here is one of the foolish people, they are tied to the real event, because her sister was one of those killed (again, how stupid it is that it is even a part of it). Guess what? The killer returns to him and we are inclined from the very beginning who he is (so there is any mystery). And, besides, where are the "policemen" and why does not anyone call them? I can not believe that this movie was funded by someone and did it. You would think that until now, the American people will be judged a little more, at least in their shooting experience, but not so much this filmmaker.
