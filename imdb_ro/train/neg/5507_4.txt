It was still a big screen output for a US TV show in the sixties It's pretty funny, but it was a lot of the formula. Intelligent Martian Land on the Earth and encounters people not too bright, in his opinion. The usual fireplace with the man, Bridges, finally connects with him and helps him get home. Along the way he also becomes the girl, Hannah. This is a nice trip for some Hollywood star plaques I have not seen for a while. Pretty nice to spend a spare time if you have nothing better to see.
