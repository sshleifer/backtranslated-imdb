I've heard rumors about a "Leonard Nimoy demonstrating the Blu-ray Disc". With advances over the past 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be revived. I only hope it helps to eliminate the taste left in my mouth through the entire Magnavision demonstration fiasco. And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a glorious milestone in the history of entertainment. After the "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the compact box" and "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the eight-piece tape" that would have expected such a glorious cinematic piece? It is crying right now just to think about it.
