To call a movie like the "Thinner" bad is that Pauly Shore's round-the-ground call is a talented. No news, but how they got that way is what people want to know. As for this movie .... The book was good, even if it was a bit derived from other stories from "be careful what you want from" genre. Burke plays an overweight attorney who kills a Gypsy daughter and is cursed by her father (Constantin from TV "Camera 222") a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it works well, but why does the Mafiot (Mantegna) involve? Why do the automatic weapons burn so much? Why is it transforming into something so strongly dependent on FX? I thought it would have been more effective if it were more focused on the subtle ramifications of fools, diseases, deaths, gypsy habits, and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, it will not be. Remember, this is Stephen King that we are talking about. And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. In fact, the entire movie is talking too much, feeling that it has to explain each plot to come back to us. Not that I expected "Dead Zone," but I could have done without another "Pet Sematary", thanks anyway. A star for at least trying to make a decent makeup job in half. However, the rest of the movie is left to be ... tell it to me ... "Thinner".
