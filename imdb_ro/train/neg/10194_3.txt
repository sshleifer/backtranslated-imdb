This 30-minute documentary, written by Bu単uel in the early 1930s, about one of the poorest regions in Spain, is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First of all, to recognize that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, though, a more condition good than the extreme poverty described here). And if poverty has fallen in Spain, it was not exactly that kind of socialism that Bu単uel favored him, but with the Western style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the film is this: in a single scene, the storyteller states that in school children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, horror! Bu単uel's lack of visibility is here, not realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technology will help the poor to overcome their situation. What does he propose? Are children being taught exactly at school? Does not Bu単uel understand that the lack of modern technology made them poor compared to other people?
