Rarely, such an amazing cast has been so badly wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro, jumped on board just to be torpedoed by a scenario that looks like a Hollywood joke. Attaching Martin Scorsese's name to this was probably draw, but the final result is much smaller than the sum of his parts. It looks like a bad horror nightmare, every scene seems more controversial than the next one. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than an abstract nonsense, elegant, self-indulgent, and the whole movie is really boring .......... MERK
