I feel much less generous with this movie than others. Expression of madness in this century is always with them being so bizarre to be a different species. Their antics are so scandalous that they are completely fictitious. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or have a fascination with the hens. They are in manufacturing or battling each other. It's like the screenwriter said, what can I do for them without a feeling of madness or even mental illness. Watch the wonderful human image of "Flew Over the Cucumber's Cage," where diseases are credible and real. I once worked at a State Mental Hospital. I have not seen any of these guys. They are too smart and calculated to make them come to life.
