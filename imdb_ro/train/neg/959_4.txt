I would have given a 1 out of 10 movie if it had not been for ms. Performance by Claudine Barretto. and I'll take this time to overlook that here Kris Aquino. and ... end up. I even avoid looking at Pinoy horror movies because the stories are not original and I even think some writers do not give enough attention to their characters (and their progress) in stories (redundant?). it was as if "pushed" the movie when their story was embarrassed. and my goodness, creative exhaustion has led them to rip through other films. Why?? why did this movie make a good review? He would not give me that great merit. the movie was a kind of scary, but the movie seemed stranger as it handles the Philippine folklore ... it goes into my category list "most likely to happen." I just wanted to spend more time to improve the story lines and repair the back sequences, without being angry if the light was sucked, it would not matter too much if the content would blow up ... SAYANG.
