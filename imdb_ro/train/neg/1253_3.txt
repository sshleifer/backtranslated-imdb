I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on remodeling bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. While this remake was not a total waste, I would still like to be the six dollars back to a DVD of the original. A lot of violence and one of the toughest endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. It just reiterates why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
