In 1972, after his wife left to make his way, Elvis Presley began to meet with Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a beautiful beauty queen with beautiful hair with beautiful hair and long hair, is designed to fill a gap in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was already in her place as the friend of the legendary interpreter of life and in the company of the traveler until 1976. This is a tasty sight of their love affair and friendship. Linda tends with all her heart to the needs and desires of her lover. And even put his medication in swallowing hand and introduce it into his own love business with valium. Sometimes this film is hard and dark of the heart; a very unattractive look at the "king" and his queen. Don Johnson is absolutely horrible as Elvis. Over handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist does not have the Linda class, but she's doing pretty well. Supporting the film includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you from checking. For most Elvis fans I've given, it's not a favorite show.
