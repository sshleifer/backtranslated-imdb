Listening to the director's comment confirmed what I had guessed while watching the movie: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play a movie. Crying is a kind of thing that cheated teenagers to come back when they go through that phase "I could write a book / script / sitcom award." There is a germ with an interesting idea buried there (probably because it's a sequel to someone else's movie), but it's entirely buried under a script scattered and laughing. <br /> <br /> Lines are terrible, and performance is relentless, though, again, I'm inclined to blame the director. He does not seem to have consulted the actors about what is needed, rather plunged the script into their hands, turned the room toward them, and told them to continue with it. Who knows, with a little coaching, these actors could have done better (we say what you like about the musicians in the movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). /> Currently, the distribution has no chemistry. A beautiful opportunity to use classical sex and vampire parallels is over when, in order to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his sick co-hunter, he receives a transfusion. He should have bite him. Remember, they should have looked vaguely interested in each other for the rest of the movie. The only real moment of sexual tensions between the two female women is by the admirers of their own accidental directors. He had initially intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more useless exposure - so I suppose the finished product could have been worse. But not too much. Frankly, while the movies go, this is badly drawn, stupid and forgetful. Even when the trashy movies are not sexy enough or hard enough to be fun. It could have been a story of fun and bleeding, but the director left with more comedy for all the wrong reasons.
