I wanted to like this movie, I really liked it. He has some good actors, but eventually collapses. Trying too hard to be funny in some places (daughters over jealous cooking attempts), over reaching others (scene cleaning one's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has a few scenes that although interesting , are really filling (all the working scene). And I did not find the "villagers" intimidated or deserved to hate them, as long as I realized I was annoying to my child. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie while playing church tickets. And I will say that the referees are on the scene, yet, in the end, I really did not care too much about the characters or about their search for the glory of the church ball. Maybe because they were all so dimensional, which I probably would not have bothered so much if the movie was funnier or seemed to be generally easier. Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment have made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
