In a miraculous way, this is actually quite tracked. I mean, it's bad. It's very bad. But while the original was so bad - is-ruining my life-bad, it's so bad - it's easy-fun bad. Correct, it's pretty poor praise. Production values ​​are rotten overboard, the action is aggressive, and Romero-Wannabe's satire can not make its mind up on what part of the ecological fence is playing. Internal logic takes a back seat at the heads that are propelled from refrigerators, the incubation times of viruses fluctuate, as the "plot" requires, bullets working against zombies or not, zombies having the power to talk or not. Gore is draw, obviously, but the frame is so slapdash is annoying. The dialogue sounds like it has been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals, and the magnitude of zombie infestation is not involved in any ingeniousness of Romero's films. Everything is overcome with a terrible synthesis score. Absolute rubbish.
