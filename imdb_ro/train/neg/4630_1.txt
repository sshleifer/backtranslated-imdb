Launched in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, this is a slightly flamboyant melody of crime with a certain sexploita in the face. As usual, for beamed films of the time, there is a fairly naked and dressed quantity, with no complemented motif of bad music, annoying narration and inconvenient editing. The caf√© scene sets the crowded bases as we gush between the characters to avoid seeing them actually talk to them. Everything we receive is a reaction to the voice of the off-screen character! Misty Ayers - pretty much Misty Ayers - cut shorts in French several times before the action starts. She is continuously accompanied by what is seemingly stock music from romantic to west to pampered meals, randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever captured on the film. Look at him when he crashes! Watch how he's hitting the match! Will he inhale or be captured by Apache? Only time will tell !! The movie tells the sordid story of how Sally is deceived to work in a brothel, falls for a dose and can not escape. For some reason, we are treated with some of the most boring and boring prostitutes ever committed to filming, literally doing nails or knitting, instead of entertaining clients. Some amazing comedies (praise women accidentally milk milk! De grace!) And the silent cinema does not work. This is one of the most serious feature films I've ever seen, even on Something Weird Video marquee. It is really a curiosity of the film for those interested in the history of cinema - very bad cinema.
