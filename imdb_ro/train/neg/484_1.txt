I was disgusted by this movie. It was not because of graphic sexual scenes, because it destroyed the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film has little to do with her and her art. She shows a work of art she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows she was introduced as a witness to rape when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. I do not know if you understand this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He cried Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false rape accusations to prevent him from suffering while he was tortured. According to the rape transcripts, she continued to argue that she never naturally knew Artemisia (aka sex), while she always says, "It's true." I encourage all people to come out and find out about the true Artemisia and see what it really is. Do not rely on all your knowledge on this fictional film. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and some amazing artwork. You do not see the movie, but find the true story of Artemisia.
