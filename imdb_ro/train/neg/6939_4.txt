R Balki tries to tell you a story that Ram Gopal Verma told earlier in Nishabd in a sensible way. This time it is mixed with mature humor. Amitabh Bachchan is a chief chef and has an Indian cuisine in London. He is very domineering and arrogant and respects his job as any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. You still can not do Hyderabadi Biryani properly. Enter the Tabu who sends Hyderabadi Biryani the right one and they start to meet and eventually fall in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 years old and Tabu is 35 years old. Smoothly! But a Hitch! Tabu's father Paresh Rawal! Couples decide to meet with their father to approve their marriage. But Amitab realizes that Tabu's father is much younger for him. And complications begin? The wise performance of all three actors is brilliant. The film's script is very tight and interesting. The film dialogues are attractive. But somewhere you feel your stomach is not filled properly. Comedy is sometimes misunderstood. The film also tries to go for a long time. From a musical point of view, there is not much to be played except for titles. The work room is good. Director R Balki could have provided much more of this scenario. But in the second half he himself seems confused. The father's "Satyagrah" scene seemed irritating. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during this scene are worthy claws. In general, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar!
