<br /> <br /> Not only do the aliens look like a frightening human woman and not only are foreign visitors able to speak English perfectly (with an Australian accent), but they also call the stars by the same name as our earthly astronomers given! <br /> <br /> And topping everything off, all extraterrestrial life knows how bad, bad, wasteful and destructive our man are. And they are very willing to tell us how bad it is. If you ever have the chance to see this movie, no. Well, if you do not suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or a surgical exploration without anesthesia. This movie tries to get a moral, ecological point of view, but it only manages to make you mock and pray that it will end soon.
