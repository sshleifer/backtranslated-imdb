No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have it behind a room than in front of one. While this film is not lacking in its interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is overcome by defects. In a sense, Angela, the criminal counselor, seems to be the same age as the camper. Having an older, more threatening director would've done a lot for the movie. And then you have murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (without any intention), although drowning a person in an outside toilet is certainly original. But, in general, there are plenty of movies that are more scary / fun to spend an hour and a half of your life.
