My husband and I bought the DVD of the old school Sesame Street for our daughter and I have to say I do not let them watch the new episodes on TV because I find ALL the characters annoying. Baby Bear and Telly? OMGosh, How can anyone think of scale and futility for "skits"? Elmo? Give her a rest, not every child likes, once again, annoying and does not teach my child NEVER. According to Noodle? what he rejects. I think once we turned the "new" show for her, she and I were terrible than before. The show certainly took the wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 from Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the GREAT EDUCATIONAL studios at SS Sesame Street have suffered a direct boredom and dissatisfaction The passing of Jim Henson in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, fun and interactive sketches it used to. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of unnecessary non-educational blabber. The Way to Take You To S.S. Producers / Writers you still have a cartoon show for parents to sit there in front of non-creative, non-performing children so they get out of their hair. Per Producers / Writers: I suggest you beat old muppets and start recording content similar to the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows for sure that I do not want my baby to talk like a baby Elmo.
