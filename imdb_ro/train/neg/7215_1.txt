This movie was a bad piece of nonsense. Everything bad. Why is it that we, those who love western movies, shake us ten times when we rent westerners. It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it is not worth mixing. For the most part, the main action of the Shiloh cascades took place in 1892, but the revolvers used were the models of the 1860s. Even the picture was bad - in a single scene, the marshal faced his six-shooter nine times and could not hit any of the three big men, only 20 meters away. I had to stop it after about 15 minutes of innocence. Perhaps those who have participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at Sunset Carson School of Action.
