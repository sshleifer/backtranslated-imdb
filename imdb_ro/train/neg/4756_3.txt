A remake of the gorgeous 1972 movie of the theater scene, which casts Caine as a nemesis of his character from the first film. But nothing else does nicely. A sub-parr performance from actors, Law and Caine, further diluted by a weak self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> The warm setting in the original is stopped for a super modern home. The subtle interaction between Oliver and Caine, who made the first film to be watched, is replaced by a staggering and cruel arrogance that immediately permits contempt for the spectator. But this is not smart, to-ing and froing to like one then the other original character encouraged so well, this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word go. This version of Sleuth does not really deserve to be seen, watch the original movie and be blind from the opening act.
