The most terrible story of a great series. It should not have been called Battlestar Galactica, because it's just the same name. Too many changes to just make changes. You have transformed characters from masculine to feminine, black or asian to cilon, in a way "to attract the female audience" when there are already strong female characters that might have become stronger. The Egyptian feelings have disappeared. The search for the earth disappeared. The lack of the cylinders to pass to the terminator rejection moves away from the film, especially when a femble is made. Awarded to the original show had a lot of cheese to it, but had a great trace. They have tried to take this into account, but they do not give their fans anything to work, and they actually spit in front of them as their "story" does. Changes are good when doing something better, not just to make them.
