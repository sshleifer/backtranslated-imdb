The best shorts of Laurel and Hardy are filled to the edge with shortcomings, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but Ollie gets the suitcase (!) Of punishment - see the great "The Music Box" (1933) Drawn in A Hole "(1932), as classic examples, but for some reason (because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father), the Boys interpret it straight in a" comedy "built around jokes It's just a 30-year tedious comedy, raised only by Stan and Ollie's personalities, who never show any of their trademark gestures (stopping Ollie, unseen Stan's observations, etc.). ) or comic abilities./> The film begins with them running away from the police.As we never see or do not know why it is hard to believe or accept the fear of being caught and thus to hide in the colone manor The premiere of humor, Ollie passing as Colonel and Stan wake up, as well as the butler and the maid are never very busy. They do not play "Stan and Ollie" in this movie. Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and would be just as poor. Stan could mimic and do whatever he would do funny, but he does not have the chance to make anybody here. He is forced to say too much dialogue to "move" the plot, but none rise far above stupidity. We are treated to countless third-person comedy chests, such as the gag of not properly pronouncing Lord Plumtree's name, "Tell me a taxi! Okay, you're a taxi!" jokes, the cops losing their clothes and seeing themselves in long johns and an end of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully painful horse suit as he dropped them on the bike for two, and James Finlayson's full of silent body and Keystone Kop Jumping Jacks. Stan and Ollie are doing a lot better in a comedy in "The Sons of Desert" (1933), where we get to see them doing what we love about them - to be themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years. Since this movie does not play at any of the strengths, why bother? I have to give her a 3.
