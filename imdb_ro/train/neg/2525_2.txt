This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have said, "more boring than the church." Maybe I did not understand quite well and thought it started pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss just started to shoot and I fought to wake you up. Again, it may symbolize something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced out of place. (END OF SPOILER). Finally, I can not see why others think it is so great that it seemed terribly boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie with my own free will, as I needed to see for a movie class.
