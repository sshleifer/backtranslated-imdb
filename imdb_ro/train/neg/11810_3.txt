I noticed with some amusement that eventually the credits, PD Detroit are happy for their participation. The police chief even has a single line of speech that plays himself (and boys, you can say he can not act). The reason for the fun is that in this film, the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the type of PR, I think a police would like. Besides, they are your standard policemen and the movie of robbers dressed in the '70s with a racial angle. Alex Rocco has a roving role for a policeman who can not go any further and is buried with a sickened mental wife. He does this as part of the local office. Hari Rhodes is his stylish partner who has a groovy closet and likes to follow after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. The film moves along the last shootout, which has absolutely no sense (why do people who are just guilty of a robbery take a whole police force?). Not only do we see a shootout, but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. Then there is an end to overthrow, which should let someone guess what would have happened, but they let me think how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the brain "Vineri Foster" and "Bucktown", I should not have wondered.
