I gave these 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes, many of them already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos in it. Besides the gorilla, I would not really call this horror as much as fictional science. It's bleak, depressing and hopeless. While I'm not bothered by a lower end than cheerful, I'm really tired of the "suck people" clich√© that is essential to each movie. I know that today you can not get a liberal art diploma without inclining yourself to the change of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but as it is done "as a writer / director, we claim that we are different from everyone else in the pack and notice that URMELE KILLING THE HUMAN RATE is bad! Right now, if you read this and believe that mankind deserves to die, go out, find a lake and swim until the arms are tired, so you will not be around to direct the next movie or write the next book, telling me I deserve to die because I'm alive. It's stupid, not attentive and boring.
