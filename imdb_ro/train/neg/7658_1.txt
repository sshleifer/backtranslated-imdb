Alone in the dark is Uwe Boll's shot in hollywood walnuts after House of the Dead's fist in front of him. If it turns out how big a Boll master manipulator is. After he forced Artisan to give up business on the flop, which was the House of the Dead, it can only be assumed that Lion's Gate Films, normally credible, released only the contractual obligation of the AITD after the purchase of Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even bigger example of total lack of consistent filmmaking capabilities, shared exposure and simply stealing badly from other movies, it should rather look instead of fitting within the movie. But then is the point, is not it? Boll is not trying to make a coherent film because he does not try to direct Alone into the dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. Alone in the Dark, as House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "announced" or "production." These are not movies that need to be targeted, but investment portfolios. Each of them rushed to production under the pretext that the tax law that Boll and his investors exploit may be closed in the next 2-3 years. Most of the bomb projects he can release during this time, the more money he and his investors can earn. Why bother to make a good movie when a bad movie makes you a mint? The result is films such as Alone in the Dark. Alone in the Dark, like all his other films, are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for the lazy film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And those who support Boll by calling them the misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations, making a figure of worship in a man, you only relieve them to attract their investors, you give him notoriety. br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s= & threadid = 21699 Besides, do not ask me how you get your lists. Unless the actors are in some way related to the scam investment, that mystery must not be discovered.
