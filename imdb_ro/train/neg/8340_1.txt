One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was so bored that I stopped it in the middle of the century to see the news. When I came back, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. There are several more dreams among them. Come on, what should I be interested in? A movie must have a reason to be interesting. The moment you felt that the movie was just a dream is when any sensitive film stops. Has anyone ever insisted on telling your dreams and what does it mean to them? This is! Very terrible.
