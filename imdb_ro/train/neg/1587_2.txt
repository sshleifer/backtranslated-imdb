Perhaps the television will be just as brutal one day. May be? Big Brother? Was it just the first step in the direction of Stephen? Richard Bachmann `The king described the end point of. But enough about that. If they spend too many words talking about the serious theme of this film, they do exactly what producers were hoping to choose. It is the same as "Day 6". No matter how primitive the film is, it raises a discussion about its subject, which serves producers as advertising. Let's not get through this. The social critique suggested by this summary of the plot is just an alibi that makes it possible to produce a violent, speculative film, more for the sale of films than for cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading it, but when I saw the movie, I thought I could not make such a terrible movie out of a good book: In a typical 1980s ensemble with music from the 1980s and other minor actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger is like a policeman who escapes from the killers on a cruel TV show. The audience applauds. <br /> <br /> Together with "Predator", this is certainly the most stupid film of Schwarzenegger. 2 out of 10 stars.
