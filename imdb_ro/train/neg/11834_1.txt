Let's just say in simple words, so even the producers of this movie may have a chance to understand: This is a very bad movie with a script, even with a great script, with animation blades and a story that is the same original as well as miniature. Do not bother - if you do not have to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They might laugh, especially if they are not in their environment. There is a special type of insult in such a ridiculous film - not only do movie makers think kids are brainless idiots who can be entertained with a stuttering that costs about zero effort but does not even bother to break a sweating inserting gag here and there that an adult might find fun. This movie, honestly, has blown my head. Shame on you because you bent so low.
