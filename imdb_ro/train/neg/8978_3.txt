If John Waters wrote and directed the "House of the 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit by his head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "Blood Blood." It's fun for the first half an hour, but then it squeezes in some kind of shriek with constant scream and people do things at the genitalia of each other with electric scissors, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in what he does in front of the room. Perhaps the best thing about "The Shed Blood" is that it will not take too long to forget most viewers.
