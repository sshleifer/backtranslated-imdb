Some news reporters and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about a zombie epidemic, despite the "government that controls the media." The story of the film does not understand that George Romero's zombie films have worked only because he has kept his policy under the background of most of his films ("Land of the Dead"). This satire is as subtle as a brick on the face or a bullet in the head is more profound for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle to see a military guy masturbating to death and destruction? Any nuances about the different advertisements intersected with the movie? Not. In addition, the action is uniformly horrible, characters that can not be useful, and the chart is unacceptable. Add it all and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie movie since "C.H.U.D. 2" grew his hideous head. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
