I came to this movie with great expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and "The Tempest," and I was interested in an adaptation. I wanted the first time to stop in ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. It was a representation of a storm, but where, in your mind, you think of a little boy on a toy boat? It's symbolic what? I went on for another ten minutes with my finger moving over the "off" button, something something would surprise me. This is not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. There is a time and a place for that, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for that in my studies about Shakespeare. Twenty-five minutes later I gave up and it was the end. I then read all the comments on this site and the claim of the film is only right for her defendants. "It's a painting ..... then put it in a gallery," "it's a ballet ... keep it on stage." Shakespeare can be smart, the songs have been broadcasted to the public, they have been accessible, and this version helps to put a shadow between Shakespeare and the general population as a whole - and I do not think Bard would be happy about that.
