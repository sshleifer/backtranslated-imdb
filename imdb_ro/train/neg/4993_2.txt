I watched you watch this movie waiting for a "nothing very much" action movie, but I was very disappointed. The opening scene promised a small action with a comedy hue. Holds you in the hook for the first half of the queue until you wait for it at the moment the action takes place. Well, nothing like this happens. The film draws and the end is only at a point where you get angry. You thought about what the director was thinking. It did not make any sense. The film was devoid of all the facts, it did not have a real story, and it seemed very empty, even though "Rambo" was in it, I do not think it could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic for the movie. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating film I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same view once they have resisted it. Sure, not for those who have a small sense of little film left in them.
