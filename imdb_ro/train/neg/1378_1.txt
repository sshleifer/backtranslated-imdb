It's like a bad show of the '80s broke out and tried to become a soft-core porn film. God, it was bad. The parcels of each character were of little relevance. There was nothing to say in the plot itself. Something about a stalker, I think. Finally he shoots himself? It's not clear, but somehow a volleyball game is involved. And the main character (Randy) is asleep around. The only reason why my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it and they wanted to go further in the scenes with him in him, who could hardly be traced to that. Thank God I have not spent money, but I want to return that hour of my life.
