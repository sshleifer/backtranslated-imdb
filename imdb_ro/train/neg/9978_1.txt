My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes, we would have called her, except that we were too curious to see if the movie could be redeemed. I was not wrong. I do not understand the praise given to this film. The writing was terrible and was delivered by some of the worst actresses I've seen in a very long time. One thing that bothered me especially about this film was that when people talked to each other was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of embarrassment (as in luck). This was not the type of break - it was simply a bad direction. This movie could be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is best for this movie, because then inherent dialogue and bad action will not be seen as much. these kinds of weird little movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but it has failed on so many levels that I consider one of the worst movies I have spent in recent years.
