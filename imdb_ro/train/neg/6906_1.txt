Not only does this film have a weak plot, a bad direction and terrible action, it opens up a whole new meaning for racism. In this movie, "white" chickens are the bitch, the "Albi" boys are the Wana-Be gangsters, and the successful businessmen (yes again) "white" are revolting to the toilet. I wonder what would happen if I made exactly the same movie with the same story line and script, just that I did about Caucasians. "Man, it's good to see you stopped meeting those black chickens." No one seems to notice this, but look back on this movie and you will vomit at the way they portrayed the new Zealand "white boys." Suddenly, his white men, who are the main cause of the gang aggression, and curse for a quick bang. Only Samoans girls have a heart, there is no white girl that is not weakened. It disgusts me that I can not make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm too generalized, watch this movie and see what you're doing from "white boys." Just because the Samoans choose to call us "white boys" in real life is not funny. If I said black boy hey, I'll lose my teeth. You do not see this movie. Do not lose your money. Do not be racist.
