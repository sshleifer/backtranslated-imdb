I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. Using a fish fish lens throughout the edition and unconditional editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of meth but it made me think I was looking at MTV for a few moments. The film does not seem to go anywhere, and acting was really an excellent example of action. I like movies that give us a glimpse into the underground world, but this movie could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or a more serious comment about the horrors of addiction.
