"Mojo" is a story of fifty years of London, a world of rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses a 1950s movie technique, often seen in films that emphasize physical differences to our time, but also represents a highly exaggerated dialogue (due to the way in which the discourse was represented in films achieved during that period); I have no idea if people have spoken so out of the movies, but the films made today and established in contemporary times do not use such a stylized language. It is as if the discrediting discourse of 1950s scriptwriters serves a common daily for a past, which therefore seems to be a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes the specific character, rather than universal, in the story. "Mojo" has a strong performance by Ian Hart and the annoying ones from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting 'career; but it feels like a piece of the era, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an obsolete idiom. Rather boring, in fact.
