I will not describe the story, as it was elsewhere. We are big fans of Clive Owen, and when Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder I never heard of this movie because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Therefore, poor production values, granular images, camera and sound shot weak. /> <br /> But, you do not really bother mechanics, because the story itself will make you sleep. It is an interesting human story, but not at all convincing, and there is almost no end. You do not care about characters, because their life is as boring as your life watching this boring movie. Save the two hours and do something to make your time more valuable.
