First, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere in this movie. What's a movie without Sam Niel. Anyone seen Event Horizon. D-Wars had a potential movie about a dragon controlling rocket launchers but it's not cold. No, no Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend you take the $ 5 or so you have to rent D-Wars and add 10 to five and buy a Sam Niel movie - apparently to send this I have to have ten lines of text, so is a list of movies Sam Niel I recommend it - jurassic park - calm calm-hunting for red October-event horizon-no jurassic park three D-general wars is a pile
