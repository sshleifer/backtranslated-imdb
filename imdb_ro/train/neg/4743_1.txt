I am here again in your local mall (of course, because where the high school kids end up !!!!!) to show how terrible "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" is really !!!! ! To prove how bad this DCOM joke is ... <br /> <br /> ... we will take these four sumo fighters and feed them in this photo cabin. How ... comfortably !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How terrible this is ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel is removing his money once again with those promises that encourage another 10 seconds, keeping the viewers wondering, "WHEN IS THIS BE PE?" And then, suddenly, when it happens for one, this not only received a higher TV rating than usual, but this was only seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once everybody !!!!! In addition, this movie is about high school and stuff, and believe me, I will not go any further with what else is there ..... Say ch ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
