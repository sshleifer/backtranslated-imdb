I think Elisabeth Rohm, though he can try hard, is not good at all. I think it was because of the budget that she would have been the only one they could get for that price. I watched it mainly for the interpretation of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. It was the most credible and undoubtedly the most impressive watch. When it's not on the screen, things are dead. He was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me creeps, but to be sure that in real life he is a compassionate man. He even said he played that role gave him crap. I'll look at him with him, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. It was as interesting as the score for the Law and the Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
