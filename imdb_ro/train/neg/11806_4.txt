It was hard to watch this movie and to be absolutely correct and objective because I am a great fan of the original 1944 film. This, for me and many others, is one of the greatest movie ever made. Realizing this is simply a low-cut film for television and most people fired it, I did not expect too much, but you can not compare it to the '44. Stage scenes, I found myself comparing what I was looking at and remembering how she played with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Now I have seen these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. When it was everywhere, I found out that it was not so bad that I expected it, but it is not a match for the original 1944. The two main areas in which this film made for television was not as good was : (1) the electricity between the two conductors was lacking and (2) it was only 90 minutes, they rushed the story hard to develop plot, characters and chemistry among these leaders. Crenna and Eggar were full, and simply did not fit for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson", respectively. If this re-make took place in other characters, like "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, the head of the insurance company. It has also been somewhat interesting to see that the time has changed, so houses, cars, telephones, dictators, etc. were in the early 1970s instead of the mid-1940s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, just rushed. However, a view was enough and I will return happily to the original for the rest of my views of this classic story and film.
