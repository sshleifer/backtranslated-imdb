I am surprised that @ IMDb reviewers have given this TV movie a high rating, as they did. It's a harmless, sweet and uncomplicated clich√© of a movie that had two big names in the past in it (both doing a decent job), but this movie revives the low budget work that we can see every day of the week with smaller cables. I love both a love story and anyone, but when my wife and I watched it - and before seeing the rating - I said, "There are people who will rate this movie too much simply because they do not there is nothing in it to provoke their brains, beliefs, levels of comfort or their cultural preferences. It is possible to make a good film of its kind (and Away from Her is an example), but it was amateur hour. over time, another one from a long line of incomplete holiday movies, watch The Stone Stone.
