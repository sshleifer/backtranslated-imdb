It was very possible the worst movie I've ever seen. Crying did not make much sense, and the act was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why he decided to make this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the entire movie, except for the opening scene. In addition, there were several points in the film, in which the act was so bad, actually I laughed out loud. But despite this, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but that means 80 minutes of your life that you will be completely wasted.
