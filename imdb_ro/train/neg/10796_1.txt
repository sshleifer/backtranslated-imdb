This film proves that "commercial" cinema, or Hollywood movies, is in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason this movie to have been produced except that someone has been waiting for success based on Shaquille's name. it's worth referring to the plot: it's a bit more perplexing than a knot. What else? The screen is somewhat dim, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. / 10.
