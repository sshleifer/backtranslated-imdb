I was going to say this was the worst homosexual film I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst movie if there's any genre I've ever seen. faces problems when a movie starts with a "personal touch" from the director, asking for "understanding" the audience for the "many challenges" a director faces for the first time. The audio track is so bad in many scenarios, it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and that from a DVD version. Inappropriate illumination, bad sets, bad photography, bad scenario, generally badly work to make this "film" unsecure. I did it until the bad end after several attempts and I immediately gave the DVD I bought crazy. I am sure there are many challenges facing a director for the first time. But do not try to remove this lame test as a finished product. From the IMDb details, this is not just Richard Natale's first attempt, but the only one. This is the only positive thing I can say about this alleged "film".
