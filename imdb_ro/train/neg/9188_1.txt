This is the only movie I've seen made by Uwe Boll, I knew he was probably the worst director so far, who always makes movies based on video games, too, that the "House of the Dead" is one of the 100 IMDb cubes. I still wanted to look at her because I am a great fan of the game and I wanted to see what the movie is doing that makes it so bad. After seeing her, I agree that it's silly, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes, there were not only teenage teen girls without brains to run (for a moment, I was wondering are dead brain zombies or girls are?), Then the night zombies came out of nowhere and began to attack later a woman started to shoot them. I mean, it took you a seat, then the other one every 5 minutes. Should it be a comedy? Or a horror? or both? Before I knew I was asleep at the second half and woke up during the end credits, so I could not see everything, which is a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not make any other movies. Thank you!
