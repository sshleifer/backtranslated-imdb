This movie will promote the improvement of mind. Read a book! It is incredible that someone would think that this film deserves the time and the investment it has to make. I have seen movies "B" before, but "C" has just been invented. I did not think I'd enjoy the Power Rangers ever since my kids stopped, but I woke up looking for the clips for fifteen minutes in the Knights. High school productions are better than these and actors involved should delete this from their resumption. Darkening is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies, even stopped her. Now I need to tell you something. If you watch this movie and you like it, I will pray for you.
