STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character of The Simpsons) is an unorthodox policeman, who achieves results, but turns his superiors to something rotten. Avoiding the murder of his partner at the beginning of the film, the plot goes in another direction and sees him as being allowed to go to Mexico where a top secret American counter-tank with firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled . to be taken hostage by a crew of terrorists alongside the crew. This inexpensive action movie (even after 80 years), boring, was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression like the flamboyant bastard, Mr. Joshua, in the Lethal Weapon. He's just going through his cartoon moves here, courageous and angry as ever (with the name "shepherd" being his mark for bad boys), but without the material to support him. Henry Silva has a role as a screen scumbag, but he is totally mistaken here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!), And the terrible scenario gives him rough lines of dialogue that make the performance come out a laugh of wood. He is just one of a series of actors of action film actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but can not add anything to the mix. After a first boring half without a very exciting action, things get a little over at the end, but it is too little too late and none of them can be fun. *
