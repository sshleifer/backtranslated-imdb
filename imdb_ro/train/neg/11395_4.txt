It's not really a new line of stories, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a dead woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and wonder if they are destined for each other. Although both are promised to others ... quite odd, they still feel that their soul is there somewhere. Few little sappy in some places, but come to love. Being a romantic, I'm almost bound to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow starts to fall. The end is almost too sweet, but most worthwhile. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who the hell could not be hit by Beckinsale. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is weird and funny. Follow it with your soul.
