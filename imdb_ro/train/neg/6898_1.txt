Avoid this stupidity at any cost. Wrong scenario, poor targeting, inappropriate action, inappropriate editing, bad sound and unpleasant music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be fragrant to the west, it is not. He's trying to be violent, he is not. Trying to present a new look to an old genre, no. The actors are doing their best there, and my heart is coming out. But with such an inadequate material to work with it is difficult to make some shine. For me, this has all the eyes of a "fresh-school movie school" that will put the world on fire "the first try." Fresh film makers often bite more like them, or their budget, they can chew. which I can do is take a few steps back, reassess what is possible and work within the limited budget limit next time.
