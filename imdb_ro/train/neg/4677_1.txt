Which left-hand bloodload in Hollywood. This film glorifies the rebellion as courageous and noble if it were for pacifist principles. The story ends with the Pacific character, played by Danzel Washington, who is actually promoting his betrayal. What is with these Hollywood instruments? Is this still a return to McCarthyism? If it sounds cynical it's because I'm fed with hawking movies a political agenda. Military brass in this film are portrayed as, what else? Gong war. Sound familiar? Do you ever see a movie in which the CIA or any government agency is not bad? Think about this. Again, Crimson Tide highlights the point. The character Hackman, Captain Ramsey of the U-boat, meets up like a wandering madman, until his end when, of course, he gets to the senses, has a complete 360, drops bloodshot, suggests a promotion for Ron Hunter, and repents by withdrawing from work. A boy rebels, takes your boat command, puts US at a serious risk of getting a first-strike, and you promote him ???? What a whistle!
