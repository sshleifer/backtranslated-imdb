If the "Exorcist II: The Heretic" of 1977 did not make any favors, it's hard to imagine what extraordinary theater Richard Burton saw in this nice exercise, without emotion. You've seen everything before: Burton plays a writer who has discovered from an early age that he has the power to move innocent objects through the force of his mind (and you think Carrie did not have any impact on Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" is played as recycled products, although the special effects of the cathedral's finale are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the support distribution is extremely poor. Burton is weird, but tired ... even telekinesis could not save him at this moment. * 1/2 from ****
