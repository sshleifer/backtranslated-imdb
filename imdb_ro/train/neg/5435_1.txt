... have the film disturbed? Anybody? I never thought. If you are looking for a summer movie, go for rent in the summer of '42. This is not the summer of '42. When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more time on screen, this is your first warning sign And of course, for such an "artisy" movie, there is a lot of curse and skin thrown around, just to make it look "artsy". Sarsgaard made his usual, uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that should have been intense. The intensity is that of a person with bipolar disorder. Miller is the most famous for her appearance and what she had to say about Pittsburgh after the movie. Pittsburgh should take a booty against her. She mistakenly represented a real native Pittsburgh. Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard style acting. Wow! Was his first role after graduating high school? So we have this strange triangle. Foster has a passion for Miller, but he's with his boss or girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed and he will not take his boss to bed. So he gets stuck with Sarsgaard & Miller, and wants to wear him. Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller is doing it, a scene that we "with every uncluttered, splashing detail. Finally, just to browse everything, Foster & Sarsgaard do, with Foster in the role of Miller, now I know how to make two boys (as if there ever was something I needed to know.) After all this, all that remains is the tragic end of a character and the retrospective views of remaining 2. I'm just in the stomach pit Oh, wait, that was the pepperoni pizza that I just had I want to come back in the time this movie came out of my life, please.
