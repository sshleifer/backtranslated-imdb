This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, his horrible. Christopher Lee is good, but he's hard in it, the only good part is the opening scene. Do not be fooled by the title. "The End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped watching it almost until the end was so bad, just to die b-film fans of hard, who have the brain to stay this vomit.
