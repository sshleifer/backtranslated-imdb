I used to love this movie as a child, but seeing it again 20+ years later, really sucks. Up Academy might have been before the 1980s, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steam dog. Without T & A. There is great except for one-liners jokes we've heard a million times before. <br /> <br /> Recently I bought the DVD in the hope that it would be a jewel I remembered being. Well, I was gone! Soundtrack was only 2-3 hits widely recognized (not the others smash compilation mentioned) and frequent voices were terrible. The only thing that was interesting was to predict who were lines before telling character. Yeah, I've been watching this movie so long then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this film should be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
