The first half of this movie is a pure delight. Romanian. Funny. Wonderful shows. A close brother and sister live in Manhattan for the same woman! Adult. Luminous. Spiritual. What else can you ask. As a romantic comedy, it begins to revive. He's headed for an unexplored territory. And then it breaks down. It goes from being a universal comedy to adults to a story outside the customs, which has been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a film of people begins with such a promise. Why it has to turn into a pedestrian film "I am who I am". Heather Graham's shoot, which ends with freezing in the air, to celebrate her "happiness to find herself" highlights the triviality of the last part of the film. It could have been different. It could have been magic. It has come to be the old old one.
