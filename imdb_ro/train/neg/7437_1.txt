This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clich√©s and a plot that does not make any sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this dreadful movie to 10. I think they are the makers of the film maker. <br /> <br /> If I could give a movie to zero, I would do it. Too bad IMDb does not allow this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched him because I went with a friend who really wanted to see him. What is sad is that we did not have great expectations from this movie to start with yet I felt short changed. Take my word, do not lose $ 8 on this piece of garbage. The only entertainment I came out of the film was the fun of the names of the directors. In all, extremely NOT RECOMMENDED!
