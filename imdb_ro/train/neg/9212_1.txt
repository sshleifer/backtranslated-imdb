the only value in this movie is to laugh at how bad it is in reality. with a plot that makes your average school writer look good, and that works almost as well, it's my bottom score. one of Hanks' very early films, where he obviously did not have the pleasure of being truly pretentious. the best special effect of the film lies in a guy dressed in an incredibly fake monster of rubber.
