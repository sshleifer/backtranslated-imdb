The Dutch Schultz, AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his pretty ugly life is pretty well documented. This film, which aims to describe her life, should have used a fictional character, because excessive events are too deviant from facts and chronology. Not only does he ignore some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the public relations fiasco in northern New York and his religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. Al. but that's as far as it goes. The explosive scene representing Luciano who executes the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own house, assisted by his own mother, is reddish. There is also a scene where the Dutch are approaching their own mother to pay for protection for Legs Diamond. It just does not work. And Mrs. Fleggenheimer's character does not work. This film does not need a bold Jewish mother for comical help. The representation of the Diamond leg blade was quite humorous. I'm sure the man is back in the grave. And, by the way, the Dutch personally killed himself personally, but it was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which the factory is erased is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just could not.
