How many centuries will it pass until the Japanese / Asian horror movie opens long-haired freshman? Of course, they managed to beat Ringu a million times and often worked well - which means that originality is not a big requirement in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please). However, this time I woke up a little restless, somewhat bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with an absurd length of 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, the WTO has no atmosphere or emotion. In addition, the end is confusing: it does not make sense at all. As for the ringtone: Miike could have come up with a more effective melody than that little thing to look at. Even if it's played a dozen times, I do not even remember - that's scary. Speaking of Miike, it's something to do with a business deal, so if someone thinks they might be perverse like "Bijita Q" or "Audition," they're wasting their time.
