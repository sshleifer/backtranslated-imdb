My brother is in love with this show, let's get it. I totally agree with those who said it was copied by Dexter's Lab and the strange strangers. <br /> <br /> I never liked the strange strangers, that is, some things made me laugh, but most of the time it's even annoying and not at all cute. This is almost the same as that of Johnny Test. Except, nothing makes me laugh at that show. Gags are so bad and meaningless, and tell you the truth, maybe I'm just myself, but the kids do not dress like that! Yeah, I think Johnny's hair is great, but c'mon! And Dexter's lab, which was one of my favorite shows, and I still do not mind seeing him. Which makes me disgusted and ashamed by Johnny Test, making an absolute JOKE of that wonderful show! Another thing. THE. Dog. It is. So. Annoying. He's louder and tiring than Johnny! And the homosexual accent? What a fudge! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies, because it would be better for children to see than listen and look at the unpleasant stupidity that appears in that show and take a homosexual accent. <br /> <br /> If you do not want your eyes to burn in miraculous flames and your fried brain from this show, do not look at it!
