Yes, I admit we wept during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could only help crying. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First, having the Million Dollar Man (former professional fighter) program in their program, and now this. The Omega Code follows a stream of religious-oriented philosophical films. It was quite funny, but at the same time it was disturbing to find such an inaccurate biblical one. The film follows what is known as the "Bible code" instead of following the actual Bible scripture. This film is very poorly accomplished; from his writing to directing him to horrible hilarious acting. His depression that people actually put effort into this film. It has appeared more like a late night movie that someone will watch on the American channel or a movie at home rather than a movie in the theater. I recommend you do not look at this movie, even if your life depended on it.
