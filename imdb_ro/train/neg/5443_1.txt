Too, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director did not manage to put it together. There is a lot of action, lots of promises, but everything comes from hokey. The director did not do the job. Promising action is no longer happening. So much seems contradictory in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV credits it in 1996) is simply not worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job.
