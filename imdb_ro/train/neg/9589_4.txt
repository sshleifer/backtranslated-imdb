This movie is horrible if you pay attention. It's a perfect movie if you watch only the colorful dances dancing on the screen - each with no apparent connection to the next one. I hired this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I appreciate the music. In the end, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes, and the songs and the dance sequences were rare and left something to be desired. The narrative's morale was really scary. I did not know if it was racial matters in London in the 1950s or not to sell. For the first half of the movie, I chuckled how dark it was, but I liked the "stop selling" campaign. When the blacks began to be killed, I thought my box was messy. Maybe I hired half of two different movies? No, there was a song and a dance "Keep Britain White". I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write about a musical. At least not a musical that could be described as "the field", as we have done several times in this review. In general, I would say that this movie could do much better if it had thought and cast better actors. (And put David Bowie in it for a long time!) My degree: C-
