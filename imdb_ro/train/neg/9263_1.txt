What was the problem with your clothes? They were all dressed like something from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The machines were even outdated. The school was outdated. The clothes for the nuns were outdated, and the hospital looked like something in the 1940s, with wooden sections and stairs, and things. Nothing in the whole movie involved the fact that it took place in 1991. My mother laughed, saying "Geeeee-od! When was this MADE movie?" When I pressed the "INFO BUTTON" button on the remote control, I was sure 1991 had to be a dude! Has anyone noticed that? My FAVORITE part, however, was when the woman told her husband, on the phone, about the reversed cross in the mirror and just said, "Well, look, I have a congress meeting, about you later." This line was just classic. JUST LIKE A MAN! My favorite part of my mother was when I gave the "Tree of the Devil" my own Rottweiler. My mom told me, "Just what the devil kind ... a rottweiler needs." He also enjoyed all the people who collapsed in the churches, holding them in the chest. Her favorite part was the guy at the school parking lot, driving 5 miles an hour, going directly to the garbage truck / front loader. He had 20 seconds just to stop the car ... but he kept walking, with an unusual look on his face. I mean, how soon can you go to a school parking lot?!?! Regardless!
