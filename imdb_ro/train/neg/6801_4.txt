First of all, I will not tell you why we rented this movie as I'm still confused ... Air rage is like any movie I've seen where a airplane is hijacked. There is, of course, that an important person in the plane, and the hijacker in search of revenge. Sad thing is, some of the methods to stop terrorists have already been used in other films. Are we really so neo-original so fast? Although it is Ice-T (which for some reason misunderstood makes painful attempts at ACTING while not busy putting "c" back in front of rap), which is glorified on the cover, the film actually makes less than the amazing Kim Oye as stewardess, who is "surprising" THE PRESIDENT of the five attackers, who naturally return to haunt them. Regarding the rest of the cast, the only person I was able to recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania of "Seinfeld". I can not forget to leave my favorite parts of the movie, when a deturator used a PLASTIQUE POINT to blow a door lock ... BRILLIANT. The plot was unusually predictable. Scenario - atrocious. It has reached the point where we could say something, which I felt would make a stupid comment, and would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> As special effects ... the only special thing about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes <br /> <br /> and the title -. the movie took place in the air. But because of the less stellar performance, the only Rage in the movie was that of the spectator. So if you're in the mood to choose a movie, just because it's bad. Please save, I do not choose this.
