Amateur, budget-free movies can be surprisingly good ... this is not one of them. Ah, another atrocity of Brad Sykes. The act is terrible, except for Emmy Smith, who shows some promises. The "direction" of the room needs a serious repair. And do not "hold the camera and run", either gimmicks; it simply does not work. The special effects are inimaginative, and there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you want to ruin your ears, please do not let us see the real actor's ears under the blood. The landscape is unique and boring (like other Sykes dances), and music is a cross between cheap motel pornography and bad guitar metal (see landscape commentary). Did I mention the absence of any real plot or character development? Apparently, the screenwriter did not. Who finances this guy ... please, stop. I have seen some of the other "home movies" (which I will not connect) and are just as bad. Normally, a "director" will develop and learn from previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur director, but anyone can be a hack. Sure, not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing on popcorn beet would be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Prize: The most serious military push-ups ever in a movie.
