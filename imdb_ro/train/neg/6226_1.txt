I gave up all the way through this movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has nothing to do with Parson's story. Hollywood tried to create a kind of comedy carousel movie. Imagine that "Englebert plays Hendrix". <br /> <br /> You do not take anything about this movie to be fair. The name Parsons in the title and theft of his body is only used as a launch pad for a low budget movie, a blatant attempt to grab a few dollars from Parsons' legacy and the base of his fans. Gram's father has died for a long time in 1973, the other global characters are fictitious, none of these things have anything to do with Grams' life or death. If you are a fan of Gram, I advise you not to see this movie. I wish I was not. It is sad to see something specially treated as such a disgusting fodder. I swear I heard that Gram returned to the grave during the movie. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and inheritance, you do not take anything in this film as Gram's representative. I can not say quite bad about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this movie, they would kill. Then again, maybe he would be afraid to know if this movie would take place.
