I saw this movie did not expect too much, I took it in a pack of 5 movies, all of which are quite terrible in their own way, because under a fiver, so what do I expect? and you know what I was right about, they were all terrible, this movie has some interesting points (some of them are stretched), the occasional viewing of the video camera is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to a drummer, that is annoying damn, The problem is the fact that it is so boring, in what I can assume it was just an attempt to build tension, nothing happens and when everything is really tedious before launch, ready to press for most of the movie, but he has gone crazy) and seriously is the band's soloist who looks very good, because he does not mention half how beautiful he is a hell he seemed a bit like a mercenary, all of this and neither at least I did not mention the killer, I will not even go into it, it's not worth explaining. Anyway, Star and London, for my part, are just a reason to pursue this, and except London (which was actually quite funny) was not due to their acting talent, I certainly saw much worse , but I have seen much better. Avoid the best if you are not bored to see the dry paint.
