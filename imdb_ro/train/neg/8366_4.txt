"SherryBaby" is a pretty painful and sordid melodrama in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is closed after a drug-related condemnation and struggles to stay clean, to find a place in life and especially regain the love of her daughter who she is taken care of by her brother's family. The only reason why the movie is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, a top-notch actress who fits well with her role and bears the entire film on her shoulders. This is not enough, however, because the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional stress is put in the wrong place - I wondered along the picture whether I should be sorry for ex and perhaps the future dependent mother drug as a director and screenwriter, or the innocent child who is in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's act could not convince me that I should not care more about the child.
