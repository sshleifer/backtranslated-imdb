I watch a lot of scary movies (or at least try to be) and that must be the worst, if not the second most horrible movie I had to make to try to stay. I never knew the depths of the massacre until we rented this piece of mold covered cheese into a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but this is worse than I'd hoped for him. On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first and a half minutes the credits rolled and I had not yet seen what pain it looked like firsthand. Perhaps there are some viewers who enjoy this and I can guide them in the right direction, but again I know those spectators who understand if they do not commemorate me, especially when you had to disable the video and that is simply NOT made with watching (we had to make an exception obviously). <br /> <br /> If it had been for a remake, I would give it a chance as long as it had at most 1% of the original embedded in it. That's all.
