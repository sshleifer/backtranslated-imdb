During the filming of the movie Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same film on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with eating disorder, is released into a house in half because of hospital overcrowding. She is by far the healthiest resident who pursues while a man puts dead flies in someone else's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the mid-house employees with a chocolate bar after struck by the measure of reducing the cost of feeding dog food residents. Ethel roars by snagging him with a wire on the stairs and then ... well, you have an idea. If everything seems to be fun, it is not. This movie was badly made with cheap and even worse effects. Characters are so straight that they give their lines to a cigarette store. To make things worse, half of the movie consists of flashbacks on the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. Very poor effort.
