I think the "Gunslinger" was not as awful as many of the movies "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but Westerners are not Roger Corman's forces. Presenting Rose Hood (Beverly Garland), becoming a sheriff in an old western city, after her sheriff husband was killed and had to fight evil, the film is quite predictable. John Irlanda is Rose's new red, who works secretly for Allison Hayes Wave (yes, the 50-foot woman). Also, Corman, star co-star Dick Miller, appears as a correspondent (Miller plays today in Joe Dante's films). I want to say that you will probably want to watch the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a long time with that.
