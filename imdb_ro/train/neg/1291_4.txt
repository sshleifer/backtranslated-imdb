I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in film material can be made in a ho-hum event. Wm C Quantrill appeared in the film, perhaps the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his sister killed every time he entered the battle was completely absent in the script. Instead, we have been forced to watch fictional characters who have never developed into who cared for us. how sad. The costumes were wonderful, however, as was the location in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee makes another movie of that period and try again, or another film producer will analyze the tremendous wealth of material to write a game on screen.
