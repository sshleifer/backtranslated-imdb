This film is a seemingly pathetic attempt to justify Mary Ann Letourneau's actions. To do this, they threw a 19-year-old woman - but probably not "to do this". There was no way he could have been 12 or 13 years old as a boy, because love scenes would have brought everyone out (if he even allowed them to do it) - such as had. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making him a pedophile. The sixth class, people. The definition of pedophile does not have to include many children - all you need is one. I really do not care about her growth or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live. The reason for this is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. It is understandable that he did not think rationally. One hopes she now understands her actions. Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray to be on drugs and to think clearly. <br /> <br /> Everything aside, Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and casting perfect for the role.
