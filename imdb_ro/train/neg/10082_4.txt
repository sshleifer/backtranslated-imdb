I laughed all the way through this rotten film. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes out and offers him a job! Hilarious! The next thing you know the two women are going to her. Yeah, I'm lesbian! Nothing is true in the movie "Life for women without anything better to do". A clandestine dialogue such as "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had the chance to be happy and I did not take it" does not help. There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves her daughter's new relationship. A black black maid - unbelievable that, in 2003, there is a movie in which there is a black maid. Hattie McDaniel must return to the grave. The woman has a husband who scares and wants custody of teenage children. Sheesh! No clips are left.
