Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to throw him like a romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, the crotons are so effective and throws them so completely that they would in a way make them look even more horrible. In his cute moments (with the girl in the train station, the final number with Rosie), I could not take his eyes off that he was so repulsive. You expect him to give up the nice act and start. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see a production of the musical scene, the 1963 movie and this 1995 film, you'll see three versions that have several revisions , the same songs attributed to different characters and situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
