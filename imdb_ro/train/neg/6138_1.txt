This movie was terrible from God, from conception to execution. Should the United States set up a Star Wars site in this remote country? Is that their premise? The way to gain access, concludes the United States, is to win an obstacle course such as the cross-country race where the winner can ask for something from the leader. And who better win this race known as "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father was operative. Lucky for our hero, there is going to be gymnastics in lucky places, such as the horse in the middle of a square (without any reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. But beyond and beyond the horrible premise, HORIBBLE, there are awkward fumblings of romantic scenes, a clearly depressed ninja, whose only job seems to hold a flag indicating the path of the race, and the worst culmination ever. After winning the race, our hero gives the American government the will. And all the effort was worth it, because the US is getting its Star Wars site! Huzzah! THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT. Wow. But being such a bad movie can be very fun to look. The only cover, describing machine gun ninjas, was enough to rent me to rent this movie. But if I ever met Kurt Thomas (real star gymnast) in real life, hit him in front of a double saloon with 2 1/2 spirals in the layout position.
