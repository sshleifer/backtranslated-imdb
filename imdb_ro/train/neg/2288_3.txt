Who is Bettie Page? I certainly did not find out while watching this movie. From what we gathered from other sources, Mrs. Page was highly sought after in the postwar period of the Second War, as the queen of "naughty" images, and that is exactly what this film describes. I never met Bettie, the woman. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an evangelical Christian Christian and a sordid life at home, which is alluded to. The film glosses over the personal life and reaches the purpose of the film, "naughty" images. Characters are inserted and dropped in a few frames, but there is a frame on Bettie's frame in his brassiere, Bettie in his girdle and stockings, Bettie in bondage ... The film moves from black and white every time Mrs. Page visits Miami Beach. Then back to the shades of gray life in New York, we're going. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the youngest young ladies you may ever meet. When Bettie confesses with a friend that she missed her high school high school by getting an A - rather than an A, she can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class. The most interesting part of this film is how the "naughty" images of Mrs. Page appear in 2007. It's really sad that seeing a woman staring like a spit pig would not even get a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure if this movie was badly written or if a crazy editor cut the piece of work. I would just recommend it as a source for people studying the history of weird apparel.
