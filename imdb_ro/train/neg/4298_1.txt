Incredibly muddled, off-putting and finally ridiculous ("horses, oh my God, horses!") Thriller. It's sometimes creepy, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. Take a look at how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the plot needs to make "resolution" happen. Poor performance of the drivers, a typical eccentric type of Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real hack, half-scene cutting and making the film even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
