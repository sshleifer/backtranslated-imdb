Annie's wig does not look good. she is not cute and eager to play Annie. Annie goes out in the movie while her costumes look like Halloween costumes. terrible and terrible actors. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and younger girl should have had the lead role. Ashley Johnson describes a very little Annie boy. It's not at all attractive. At least the casting director managed to do it with Dad Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also mistaken. Camilla Belle played Molly all right. "Watch out" that this movie could offend your IQ so you can only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fictitious and could not happen in the real world.
