I give this demanding piece of rubbish a simple one because I do not think there is a worse movie in the world. I hate this movie, I do not like the act, dialogue, setting, writing and directing. I hope everyone involved in this movie burns and turns in the darkest circle of hell. Damn it, this disastrous loss of time. I pray every day that this film is just a fiction of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed the movie and that I will never have to see it at my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
