Forget Plan 9, this is the final fiasco, a dramatic costume, heart-directed, scripted, acting, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's novel, which is not so much better. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films) and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are trying hard to get through such a terrible scenario. A lot of mistakes (like, for example, when snowing in Christmas in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of evil called "realism magic," it is remarkable as the worst film of all time. It's totally shit !!!
