Omen IV (1991) was an evil done for T.V. movie. Since the 1980s, I think executives have experienced met (the drug chosen in the 1990s) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they even bother to do this? A TV. movie? What happened when it came to this idea? They even thought for a moment that this film would be caught. Perhaps they thought they could make a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have escaped a few dollars instead of putting on the "extra" disk. Omen IV is, in principle, an American average American remake of the first film. Instead of a night punk kid, we take the frightening girl, who is a total girl for everyone around her. If the family had stronger abilities for parents, then none of the demonic events that appeared in the past movies would ever have happened. These parents have to put their foot down and make a real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid at any price!
