For my life, I can not understand why she would like to make a movie about Jerry Springer's Show. It's so incalculable. In some ways, unfortunately it is a guilty pleasure. We have to admit we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I have recently seen this in the US. It's kind of bad. I'll recognize that. Jerry is doing a horrible job of what he thinks would work. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. Playing in principle. All she needed was her boyfriend, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So, I'd recommend jumping "Ringmaster." Just watch the "Jerry Springer" show. It's more pleasant than that. <br /> <br /> 2/10
