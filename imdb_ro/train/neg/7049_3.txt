The only worse thing than waveless surfers is a movie about surfers without waves. For viewers who love to surf this movie, it will be a gigantic disappointment, as the total number of minutes of surfing is struggling to reach three. The story is a bit of life about surfers who do not expect to wave perfectly, but for any wave at all. Sean Pertwee (Sean Pertwee) is an aging surf surfer who flirts with a commitment with his girlfriend, Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). As he is about to find happiness with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends come back and convince him to hit the beach in search of waves of monsters in the backyard. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the movie, so most of the story is scattered over a meandering succession of disconnected beach events. The act is, for the most part, mediocre. Sean Pertwee has some comic moments, but most of it was an actress. Ewan McGregor was decent as the wild-natured drug, by far the most interesting and strange character of the bunch. Probably the funniest show was turned by Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his corpse into a continuous gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character did not have enough meat to show her much ability to act. There is not much here to comment on. I rated it at 3/10. It is a true beach of the beach.
