Otto Preminger leads this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her widowed father David Niven celebrated in southern France with Mylène Demongeot nut. Things are good until the family friend, Deborah Kerr, appears. Nivens, a feminine degenerate, finds Kerr's conquest too strong to resist. She's fine with Seberg, as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as it did with all the women in the past ... including Demongeot). When he appears to be the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg avenges Kerr exactly. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and combines intelligent black and white with sunny scenes. Georges Périnal's cinematography is breathtaking. The film features some of the least directed directions of Preminger, although he rarely allows any close-ups, making it difficult to find out what actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is full of acidic dialogues and fun scenes (involving, for the most part, the Demongeot Birds Brain). Seberg is paying pretty well, but Niven is at least appealing ... and he does not show any chemistry either with Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with this casting. It's a role that seems customized for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg and Martita Hunt as Daffy's mother. Juliette Greco, singing alone, sings the title song in a nightclub in Paris. The great titles are from Preminger Regular Saul Bass.
