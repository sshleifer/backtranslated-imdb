This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The act was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in an eve is scheduled to appear one evening. Most of the world's population decided to look at this comet. Then, the next morning, everyone, except for a few selected people, was turned into dust from the radiation of the comet. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been turned into dust. There are no bones, nothing. That's ridiculous. How can the radiation incinerate people, but leave their clothes and other intact substances intact? Even better, the comet has moved some people into zombie meat that eats monsters. Their makeup would not even look frightening for a newborn. Insane Clown Posse scares me more ... and should look bad. Then there were the survivors. The people who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were free of the zombie-dome and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that is supposed to incinerate people in their tracks? Equally insulting is the horror music of the 1960s, played in the background by parts of the movie or 80s hair, which has no purpose in the movie and makes you want to shoot your television. The stupidest part of the film, however, are the characters on which it focuses: two Girls from the Vale and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go rob the day after an apocalypse with mutants who eat meat running all over? There were four horror scenes of five minutes in the whole movie, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes is a simple dialogue that makes South Park look smart. The silence between elemental dialogue was painful. I could have done a better movie with four monkeys and a Cheetos bag. I never see this movie.
