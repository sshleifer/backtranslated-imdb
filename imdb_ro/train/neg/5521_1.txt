I just came to see this movie and decided to see what the others were thinking. I wonder if those people who give shining comments have seen the same movie! This is a very good story, but fails to hit the mark. The scenario is very poor - the plot has so many holes that it would make a large bathing net for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the story so much so that I woke up wondering, "How did I get here?" at least half a dozen times during the movie. There was no lack of chemistry among cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the filming. It was pretty clear that everyone looked and did their job, but he did not get involved in their roles. This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a hot and warm bath and save money for something worthwhile!
