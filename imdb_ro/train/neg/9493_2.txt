This strange film offers the standard of the "hippie mentality" of 1970 in a shell of nuts and destroys us in this process. It is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of young, innocent women, elders and elders. A young nasty hippie, played by the cock (Kay Lenz), sleeps and sleeps with all the bad boys, then one day he meets old-eyed (Holden), drinks the beverage and launches as an actor, and she decides he is in "love" with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole movie encapsulates such scenes. She continues to say how much she "loves" her, and she just knew him, she was wearing thin and very fast. I could not laugh at the movie. It is obvious that it only uses it as a table ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that we will buy that there is, in fact, any love that takes place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I had to move forward, because it almost inspired me to vomit. A music offer from the '70s is also broadcast through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D
