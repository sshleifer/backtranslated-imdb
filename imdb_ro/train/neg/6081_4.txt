A typical 70-year-old film, an original and good music, but with some strange, an interesting but not fantastic photo, a poor and sometimes confusing story (for example, the role of the wolf dog and where does the boy come from)? a weak dialogue with a pleasant atmosphere. The reason why it is still (relatively) well known and sought is probably nude scenes (including the typical pseudo-coitus of the 70s) involving a 11 and 13-year-old girl with an older boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - socio-politically interesting to see how these representations of very young teenagers were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the USA) 30 years ago, while it is now more than taboo. The story revolves around the aggression of a girl (Laura) by the other two characters and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of a teenage life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve until the end of the film and appears already very versatile in erotic arts - for her there is no "age": she is a very vain little girl who is already aware of her sexual charms, but in her trace is just used and ends the movie crying like the little girl she really is still in. The boy is a despicable bully, while Laura comes as a very naive and feeble victim.
