I gave up trying to find out what version of this I'm looking at. Copyright at the end of the year indicates 1983. And although this is not an important aspect of my objection to this film, I will say that watching a movie made obviously in the vapor age (including hippie long-haired chickens and wagons Odise) The sound of the 80s is disturbing. Extremely disturbing. My main objection here is HOW CAN WE FRANKLIN ALIVE FAMILY. HOW YOU WANT GOD. Seriously, she's all adorable and stuff, but in the two movies I've seen - this crapfest and otherwise excellent Legend of Hell's house - kills her. > <br /> I would like to pay attention to the cinema industry. Pamela Franklin seems to have withdrawn from the business, but if she ever decides to make another film and some who tried to kill her, I'm going to ask them to leave him. PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GO WITH YOU. I AM CROSS. Anger was unleashed. For B movie fans looking for a crapfest, you could do much worse than that. Additionally, this film is not a film involving Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this film is a hard satanic film. <br /> <br /> Satanic Wall-to-Wall ceremonies, baphometers, hallucinations, a rat attack - what else could you ask for. This excellent question is quite ruined by the synthetic sound of the album greffed in the 1980s, which is a bit inappropriate for a movie, as it may be. The soundtrack reminded me of something you heard on the Equalizer. It's very bad. They also made Pamela Franklin to have his charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocite (as opposed to the spectator) as you could be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speaking in her voice. Who's with me? I could forgive anything else about this movie if I did not abuse Pamela Franklin. So I drop the glove down, gentlemen - Anyone with Pamela Franckin Messes with me. Even in a fictional context. Hello, sir.
