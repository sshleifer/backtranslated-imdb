Another violent fantasy, upset by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's hard to say if it takes its sordid impulses seriously, deliberately sardonic or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant images in the world (and these have some remarkable) can not hide negligence in story, dialogue, and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to turn into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a pleasant actor, occasionally showing his dark side ("The River Wild") in an attempt to make up for his boyfriend; Given the material, however, Bacon is not quite ugly enough to bind. The other directors are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom are sufficiently endowed to make a solid impression, and who, when forced to make a new dialogue, get fainter. The climax is an overriding study and distrust really needs to be suspended.
