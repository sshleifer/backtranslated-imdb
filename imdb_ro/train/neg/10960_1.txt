Ouch! They do not come much worse than this horrible adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very valid for the novel, the act is simply terrible, and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school piece. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the most grandiose the BBC ever gave, but surely it could have united a little more than the two dollars that show it was filmed. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know the effects on the computer were not at the level necessary or even cost-effective at the time, but the man in the costume suit was horrible. Better to cut the character in the movie than to do this role! Avoid this at any cost.
