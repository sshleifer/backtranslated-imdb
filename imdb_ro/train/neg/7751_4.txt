First, CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched her during a bad movie marathon on the SciFi channel. At the end when the owner of the park is killed, it is probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even the night of the living dead had a better animation. That being said, the film had almost no plot. Why were they on the island in private? Well, it was not mentioned in the movie. And why would people enter the cat's area? Makes no sense. One thing that remarked in this movie was a moderate action. In what could be called the movie "B made for TV movie", the act was very good. Parry Shen was particularly noted. If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It might be good for some memorable quotes.
