A weak point in human interaction was reached by the Maysles brothers with this film. Remember, you who used words like "masterpiece" when reviewing this film, that these Maysles movies did not just lead to Hamptons and act the film of eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people, they had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No meeting of mind here or real consensus participation. These miserable Maysles smiled, kissed the ass, did everything they could to make Beales cooperate and then exploit them as viciously as ever. One would like to believe that these wizards had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the filming process, taking into account the pre-planned, actual and editing, took a long time, and their purpose had no provision referring to Beales as human beings. A exploitative movie committed by the most destitute people. With the accumulation of time, the film's reputation was badly affected by what they did here. Their reputation for human beings is exaggerated. This is what people will remember. Grotesque monks.
