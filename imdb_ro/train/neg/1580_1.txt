this movie has become a worship movie in Chinese students, although I watched it until it was broadcast on Channel 4, UK. full of giddy art claims, the plot is mediocre and unreal; "the spirit" he wants to convey is how independent artists oppose the commercialization of the musical industry "and maintain" the purity of an artistic soul "and not sell for dirty money." which is truly giddy and superficial; the diologist is mainly pathetic. it is weak. sceenplay is full of artwork. is a fantasy movie for kids and that's all <br /> <br />
