First there is nothing wrong with the study of Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. Also, there is nothing wrong with making a movie like this to try to present the gospel message. So my dissatisfaction with this movie is neither in sincerity nor in aspirations. As a Christian, though amilenialist, I think there will be great trouble and I think Christ will return as he said. So even if I disagree with this movie about kidnapping, which is not the reason I'm evaluating this movie so low. No, what makes me miss this movie so low is not its sincerity or message, but rather the lack of production values, horrible scenario, mediocre action, and pitiful FX. This film is located there with some of the world's finest science fodder in the 1950s. No, this movie is in place with Plan 9 of Outerspace. This movie failed to grow well and was probably dated when it was made. Apocalypse filmmakers could have learned how to not make an end-time movie, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega code series have failed to learn because they have approached the FX issues and the dated problem, but their scenarios are still weak and their operation is made of wood. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian movies with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the MST3K crew has never lightened this.
