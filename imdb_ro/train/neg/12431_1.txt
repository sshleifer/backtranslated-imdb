I would like to say that the curiosity had the best thing on my part. If I saw only a trailer, I would be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could save myself the most useless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster that is expected to happen and is an embarrassment at Hollywood. The film presents a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this child's long-distance racing car goes all over the area and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a distance can no longer transmit a signal in these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe that. The usual logic and every concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the racing car could have reached the street, not to mention a house on the streets. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals possess. Why is it happening in all these films, these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet the age of eight? Does the child have to be the smartest person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts his real gun and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove, you should be able to do that. Just because it looks the same, it does not mean anything; there are other senses, then the sight. Pitfalls are also unrealistic; if any of them actually worked, the offenders would be dead. But, Hollywood plans to "laugh" at the "funny" trap results. I did not laugh; I sigh, and I stretched my eyes. But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a very bad movie; the movie they saw would look like Citizen Kane compared to it. Otherwise, skip this for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex Linz in the movie, but did he write?
