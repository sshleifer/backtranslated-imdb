All the funny things happening in this sitcom are based on the main character Jim being either a bad father, a bad husband or, in general, just a little selfish. How can it be fun? Of course, a character in a sitcom must be defective, but Jim's character is defective in an extremely unobtrusive manner. Why? I think it's because "it would be good right now." Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and has the opportunity to do that. But he chooses not to. It's a conscious choice when he chooses not to play with his children, not to go shopping because he does not want to buy "lady" products, and it's a choice he takes when he takes his relatives off. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be just in series, so Jim can have someone to be a bastard. If Cheryl was a real person, she would have left him years ago and not stay with mortar for 8 years. But, unfortunately, she is just a catalyst for Jim's weird middle class egoism.
