I have never heard of this before the owner of the local DVD rental store tells me that; being a horror film of the 1980s, with the notorious distinction of being banned in the UK, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to be a dull, amateur and ugly journey; recording the sound is so weak that the dialogue is half the half of the misunderstanding, while the act gives a new meaning to the inept word! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the movie follows the tired formula of a trio of teen girls who get involved in an accident and find themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in distant surroundings. Soon, one of the girls goes looking for help and does not hear again; another, still square, is removed quickly (after being forgotten for most of the duration). Heroin is the one who interacts the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a biblical mother-in-law (courageous courageous), her repressed daughter (and suffering for a long time) and her strange brother, who occasionally appears to fall over sleeping guests. Often the use of dinner reminiscences by the mother who hates the man (as a means of filling the misfortune, of not telling anything about the uniginal, history) and which invariably develops in mother-daughter sparring competitions, the film has a shit in the sleeve - the end of the twist is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does not do much to eliminate the bad taste left in the film mouth (as much as that pussy as an intermittent gore) or the inevitable feeling of losing 80 minutes of my time ...
