This film reminds me of how college students used to protest the Vietnam War. As if after hearing a few children without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the president would immediately change the US foreign policy. The worst thing is that, though dangerous, the concept of politics based on the fact that if the USSR and the US went to war, it could mean the end of the world, WORKED. The US and the USSR ARE NOT EVER TO WAR. If there were conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a "winning" war in Europe and Asia, was not inconceivable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think I should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "How not to make a movie". Should be 0 stars or black holes ...
