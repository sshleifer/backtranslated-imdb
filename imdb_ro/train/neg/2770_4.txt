Hollywood Hotel was the last musical movie that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His directorial style has changed or evolved to the point where this film does not contain support signatures or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. In the last few years of the thirties, large swing bands have recorded the biggest popular hits of the year. The Swing, also called the Era Big Band, was dated differently from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 until 1949. Although it is impossible to tell exactly when the Swing Hero began, Benny Goodman's commitment at Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles late 1935 was certainly one of the first signs that the cradle entered the consciousness of the young American Americans. When Goodman presented his swing repertoire, rather than the dance music in the style of society that the band had played, the young people in the audience became wild. This was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts and word-of-mouth were the main methods available to spread the phenomenon, it took some time before the swing made enough excuses to produce big hits that had appeared on pop charts. The Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra and Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film, indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the change in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half after Goodman's commitment Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting moments here and there at the Hollywood Hotel, but with the exception of Benny Goodman and his orchestra Sing, Sing, Sing, there is not much joy. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening of the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and the "Let That Be a Lesson for You" production number at the drive-in restaurant. The movie is most interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and his orchestra, and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
