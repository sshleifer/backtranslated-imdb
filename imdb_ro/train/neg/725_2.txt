It was a terrible movie! Not for the subject in question, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), waiting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no exaltation at the end. Your previews and ads have made no mention of it! Besides, for all they played on Whoopi Goldberg, my memory is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews do not say anything about it! (not that you would expect this, but it's just a bigger problem). If I knew how depressing this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would have been prepared for it. This was an ad campaign of bait and change and I will not see the movie again!
