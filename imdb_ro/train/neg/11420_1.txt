The fire of St. Elmo has nothing to do with life after university (for most ordinary people, anyway). Why was this garbage even made? Who can really refer to that? Who lives like these characters? I'm sorry that the actors are confronted with such a terrible scenario. There are some young talented actors in this movie who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been a whole joke with them on the set. I actually found this insulting "film" of my intelligence. The only joy I get from this is that Sir John Hughes had a good laugh when he saw this year's view of the The Breakfast Club's masterpiece. the same mistake I made about this because you enjoy the 80's. It's genuinely offensive.
