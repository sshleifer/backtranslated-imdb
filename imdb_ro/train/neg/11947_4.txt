An interesting change to the first. it was more mystery for this movie, then the first. Even when you end up wondering what happened to who the killer was. There are some good parts through the film, the first half starts slowly and then in the last half of the rhythm rises. The movie is nice. The story is 22 years from the events that took place in the first film, Norman Bates is in a nursing home and back at the Bates motel, but when a woman claims to be her real mother, things start to it's cheating. Perkins plays again a Norman cloud aged and the scene from the end was excellent, he knocked that hell hard.
