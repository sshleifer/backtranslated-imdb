What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest that you make a handful of actors and their producers and lead a big salary because you do nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring film. An ex-pugilist of an excess of brain fits with a strange woman and her relatives. He starts out as a man for woman, and turns around in a man's beating and trapped in a kidnapping scheme. She was so confused that I can not even write a decent criticism. If you see this, sweetheart, make sure it's after dark so you can go to bed.
