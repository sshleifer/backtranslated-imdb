Any movie with a title as ridiculous as "The Bagman" should automatically draw the attention of anyone loving bad movies, but the plot is a lot different than what you can expect after watching the DVD cover. Bagman is not a good movie at all. It falls into the category of films that seem (and probably were) filmed on a home video camera. The act is terrible. I have not heard and have not seen such a wooden action at Troll 2. There are lots of scenes with nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumping in too fast. The characters are cursed and completely forgotten. The ending (which I will not spoil) can be easily anticipated after seeing the first scene. Due to the soft nature of the film, nothing beyond the dreadful values ​​of production is truly terrifying (awful attempts of a realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Recommended only for bad movie fans.
