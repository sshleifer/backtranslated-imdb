First of all, this is a very dated, untouched film in its exposure to the political revolution on the left. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be really revolutionary is to stop being intellectual (which in itself is meaningless at all, since the answer has been achieved by being intellectually) it reduces me to despair ; as if we should all go back to being monkeys in the name of equality - it's simply ridiculous. Our intellect is just one of the many human qualities, but that does not mean that we do not have to educate ourselves to the fullest extent possible. But, no doubt, this non-educational message is linked to Godard's use of rock music; therefore, The Rolling Stones. The song "Sympathy for the Devil," whose creation we confess and from which the film takes its name, is actually nothing special. The string sequence, which is not particularly original, was used to have a much better effect in Led Zeppelin's "Led Zeppelin II". Besides, "Sir" Mick Jagger usually speaks nebulos (rather like Bob Dylan) - you notice how the first melodic repetition is repeated unimaginably to form the verse. In addition to the fact that the Panthers Black, described in this film, do not seem to know what battle, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual "release" of the 1960s and today (indeed, a message that would have believed The Rolling Stones's behavior during the movie). No wonder the DVD came for free with The Sunday Times! For a truly deep historical experience of left-handed sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore.
