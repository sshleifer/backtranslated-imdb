Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. The first time I was a kid, the movie was fun enough for me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and exciting, and the main character was pretty cool. I saw her again a few days ago. It was terrible. Really. I do not know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I did not laugh at all. There was nothing fun. He was just stupid. The story was feeble. The act was nothing special. There are great actors in this movie, but action is, at best, mediocre. What is worst is the fact that this film is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in the movies. However, I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like Shaolin Temple or the fact that the only black man in The Street Fighter is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever it is, point. There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how he would react to a movie like "The Meteor Man". Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good boys. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All good boys are African-American Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care that the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is the fact that I barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie I've ever seen. It's not realistic. If there is one black man in a Japanese film, as is the case with Street Fighter, there is no problem - in Japan most people are Asian. But if there is one single white man in an American film, there is a problem - in the US most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with a whitish cast and just an Asian as a bad guy. It's just not real. This is. I give the film the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with the baby.
