I just finished watching this movie and found out that basically it was not funny at all. I am a Gamer RPG (type of computer, none of the stuff in DnD tablets), but we have not found any of the jokes in this funny at all. Some scenes seemed to drain a lot (the tilt and zoom could have been cut in 5 seconds rather than over a minute) and it feels as if the director was just trying to fill the time. I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times in the whole movie. The act itself was not that bad around the standard that a Category B movie should have. I would suggest not to bother with this movie if you are not a huge DnD fan and even then it would be better to give up.
