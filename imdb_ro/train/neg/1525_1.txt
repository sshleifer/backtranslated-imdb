I watched this on a weekend afternoon, because it was simply nothing else, it would have been more fun to chew my legs and probably less painful. I urge anyone to follow this up just to see how horrible a movie is, certainly deliberate. I headed for any unnecessary humorous attempt done so childishly, unsuccessfully, badly executed that it was beyond faith. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas, do you think I'm exaggerating? Well, give it broadcast time and think again. Very awful, terrible. If it was not a joke, the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and shot immediately after being forced to watch this movie again.
