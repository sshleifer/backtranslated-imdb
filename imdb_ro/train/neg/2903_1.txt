Ouch. This movie could be subtitled "When writers strike!" What lead. We had great hopes for this, especially after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole IMDb rating system, but that's a separate matter. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, etc. so I was expecting great things. Saying that I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but I will confine myself to (a) the implausibility of any family that behaves like these people do (a mass aerobics training, what is the real life planet?), A killer of love , please, and the fact that Dan's character is so untouched can you find yourself wondering what the little girl has seen in him to make her fall in love with him? This movie was filled with a strange, ridiculous dialogue with ridiculous scenes and was slow, slow, slow. I would have gone after half an hour if I had not been with my parents, who did not get away too much and did not like to lose money. Unlike the producers of this film, who would have been better off throwing all the money spent doing this movie in a campfire - which would have been more fun. If you like movies, avoid this as the plague.
