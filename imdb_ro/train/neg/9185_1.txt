WOW! I did not know anyone would do this movie! it's terrible! I wrote 5 things that can tell why i do not want to see this movie. Number 1: "the greatest rave ever" where is that rave? I could see only a few people dancing around. <br /> <br /> 2. When I'm in the rashes, they can only see blood all over, without people, broken tents and a stage ... and what do they do? they drink! 3. the worst actors I've ever seen! the captain and his crew ... terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people pulls a regular gun, he shoots almost 30 times without recharging! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that everybody in the world could fight as a pro! it must be a new thing. I wonder what the producer was thinking! "this will be a great success, it will be a classic" .. sure not bad **, anyway you do not see this movie, a waist of time. My eyes are still tangled!
