I decided to watch this show after seeing the endless ads on the BBC in the weeks before it started. I looked at it in spite of the fact that I do not like the pretentious things that Alan Hollinghurst writes (I'm sorry for the fans, but I think we have a new case of the Emperor's work with this author). I admit that the action is excellent, it is beautiful shot and I really enjoyed it - however - I discovered that the story was extremely thin and after seeing all three episodes feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The explicit "homosexual" sex that the media broke down has been made on television - many times - so I was not afraid very much. Full marks for production values, but low for story / content I'm afraid.
