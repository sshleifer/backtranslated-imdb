So far, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You should check your reviews for that movie instead of it. The review statistics for this movie have been positively biased by an impetuous and unscrupulous force by some of those involved in doing so, evidence of which is quite easy to find online. At least those who did Ben & Arthur were sufficiently honored to let them stand on their own strange feet, instead of promoting them unscrupulously, as they suggest me, they would buy it. Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, casting, acting, direction, photography, editing, music ... what else is going on in a movie? Whatever it is, here is as bad as it happens. If it were not so unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I always looked at myself thinking it should be better because I have not yet found that none of the positive reviews for this is reliable. Do not take much money to make a great movie, no budget cut does not mean that a movie should be bad. My favorite example of a budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sant's amazing Mala Noche, but there are many more. "Secondary Secrets"? Director cut or original? It's bad not because people who did it did not have money but because they had gigantic ego and no talent for anything except self-promotion.
