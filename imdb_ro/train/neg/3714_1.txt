This film is a re-writing of 1978 Warren Beatty, "Heaven Can Wait," but is written for Mr. Rock's stand-up comic style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his lifetime rises and there is an agreement with God's representative, King, to return to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses Charles Wellington, a rich white man, killed, because he likes Sonney Jenkins (Queen King) who is going to return to Wellington's house during the crime. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her boyfriend suffers in this remake, and the idea of ​​turning a white elderly millionaire into a black comedian standing up trying to make Sontee simply does not work. Also, the intersections used to show Rock as Wellington and then the true "white" Wellington, do not succeed at all. Improvements could have been made to the original Beatty plot - which, in itself, would not have represented it on the scene of the idea of ​​life after death - but certainly not in Down to Earth.
