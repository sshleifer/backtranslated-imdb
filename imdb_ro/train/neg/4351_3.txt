Every generation fully believes that they are finally living. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did the great Orson Welles talk about this wreck of the train? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. He tries to link the prophecies, as well as what happened in the moments when it was done, making it obviously dated and some kind of stupidity. Reconstructions seem to be from "Unsolved Mysteries" but without high production values. People should have felt embarrassed to take part in this. In short, the film is dated, stupid, reactionary and useless. Okay, if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to look for it.
