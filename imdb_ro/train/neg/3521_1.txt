Still waking up to the thought of seeing this movie again. I have seen action movies, I really liked very few, but it goes over the top. <br /> <br /> Not only does she have the worst male actor (Sly Stallone) who plays the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not spoil the money while the plane is at soil, be much easier) that it takes a person with a lower IQ than a little boy to believe. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real overthrow, a three-year-old can figure out what's next. It's a set of clich√©s, with Sly's performance even worse than his other films (it was better even in Rambo III if you look at this movie as a comedy rather than a movie action movie). Now there is an actor who can not act A) surprised B) sad C) something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I still want to point out that this film has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are remarkable, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. LANDSCAPES are magnificent, but then ... there is documentation about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better views in this direction than to waste time in this move. Go to watch another movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands of better action movies.
