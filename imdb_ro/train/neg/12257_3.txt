"It's not like a big toy," says a character from the beginning of the year, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would just like to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the Jaws series. In other words, the special digital effects of this film are TERRIBLE. The actors and directors are not much better; they seem more suitable for a deodorant or a chewing gum than for a horror movie. The attitude of those who have worked on this film is contemptuous not only for the genre, but also for the audience. Saying "you liked it," this film encourages filmmakers to give us more of these nonsense, still destroying the horror genre. (* 1/2)
