This is a simple story, but it feels very manipulative. It has no pathos because it leaves no room for imagination or personal thought or time for reflection. Animation is well done, but I feel it is too presentation. I would have preferred more back pictures, more space in the background and maybe that would not feel so kitsch for me. But for a Hollywood style movie it works ok but it's very derived from Aardman movies and that bothers me. Perhaps a longer film will test if this producer can do without voice over. I think the voice over is too glib.
