I hate to throw like this, but in this case I feel like: The American remake of The GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters over the last 5 years. That's where I said. And now that I have escaped from my system, please explain why. When someone dies in the hand of a strong rage, a curse is born. of death, those who will meet him will be devoured by his anger. "This is the premise of the GROUP and I admit it sounds interesting, unfortunately, the directors do not take it any further, those who meet the" curse "are really consumed by the anger and that's all you get.You want more ... Very bad Some critics and fans emphasize that the only purpose of GRUDGE is to scare you.The problem is that when there is no plot to talk about creepy images and sounds "Takashi Shimizu, drawing a George Sluizer and remaking his own original films, is trying hard to build an atmosphere in the first hour by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. this: <br /> <br /> - The person enters the house <br /> <br /> - something blinking by the camera and / or a strange sound <br /> <br /> - the person goes for to invest <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> - cut to the black <br /> <br /> Before the audience gets even a hint of plot, this exact same scenario takes place 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Every subsequent use became ridiculous as the movie continued. Until the movie is over, my friend and I have been asked if this scene will end "with a loud cry and a black cut." We have never proved wrong. The film does not have a story about the liner, but instead it is in a series of vignettes that left the poor audience. I have no problem with the non-linear story when it does well. The film jumps from time to time without any rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the HIGHLANDER 2 theatrical version. And this storytelling technique marks every kind of mystery the movie could have. If you already know that ghosts have scared two dead, how shocking when their bodies are in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? Obviously, the second green, American version of RING has made its first $ 15 million weekend, THE GRUDGE is just a calculated imitation disguised as real movie. The most frightening of GRUDGE is that they made their first weekend of $ 40 million, and some people find it "the most frightening movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the anger to pay to see GRUDGE?
