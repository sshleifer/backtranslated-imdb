Looking only at sets, staging and editing, it is easy to say that this project did not have an adequate budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi has the intention of stopping things like this. The young brides fell dead at the altar after saying "I do." Their bodies are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and some of his minions as his aged wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of young girls' glandular fluids to stay young ... beautiful forever. A cute local reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride wears the same rare orchid at the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be best informed. A typical horror film storm that makes a visit to the Lorenz estate a little scary; especially with a dwarf and a hump in place. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
