Pokemon 3 is slightly more than three or four episodes of the TV series, tight together without regular commercials. The story is typical for Pokemon (conflict, battle and a resolution in which everyone is finally happy) and there is nothing original or unusual in animation. Some holes in the plot are completed (without explanation) and everything is a bit too sweet. Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be a part of your child's world. Both of my sons enjoy Pokemon, and by showing interest in what they like, we are closer. Watching a movie in a theater is still different from the one on the tube, and my sons enjoy cinematic experience. I gave the film four times, especially from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
