Michael Keaton has never been a good actor; In Tim Burton's films, Batman always comes in the shadow of his big bastards. Here, he plays the role of a widow husband who takes over the radio frequencies that seem to be dead people trying to get in touch with the living ... Well, this should be a rather shocking thriller, but it really is miss any place where it shocks you. Because there are too many things that become unexplained, undiscovered and uninteresting. So, where is the shocking emotion when everything gets so bad a movie made first of all that WHITE NOISE makes a madman of himself? Really bad acting and terribly edited, this movie is nothing to watch. Michael Keaton tries to return to the thriller, but ends more like never before.
