Calling a movie about a stray ghost to take revenge beyond trickery and life is too ironic, but this is an indisputable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) by LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); While it is at the same time pursued in itself, it is so clich√© that it causes chicks instead of intentional colds. However, due to the difficult straits in which the British film industry was at the end of the 1970s, even a mediocre script like this was able to attract ten stars - Cliff Robertson (as conniving husband), Jean Simmons Jayston Robertson's business), Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Jenny Agutter (as half Robertson's sister), Simon Ward (as enigmatic driver), the most good friend and wife of Jayston), Flora Robson (as a housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary read by Simmons' will) and, most surprisingly, probably Jack Warner (as a stone sculptor) - although most have nothing, I'm sorry to say!
