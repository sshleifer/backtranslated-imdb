One bad thing. Oh, my ... this is one of the movies that do not even have a positive effect. Everything, from actors to story, goes to the sky. I just wonder how low I.Q. you should look at this type of movie and even enjoy yourself. Is it something worth looking? Well, there is a lot of nudity involved, but there is nothing special. And when you think you can not get worse, you realize that all the naked ladies were about forty years old. Boys, where did you look for these actresses? In the elderly house, maybe. However, leading actresses have some sex appeal and know how to show them. Again, too bad, too weak and old. Generally, skip them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
