The people who will remember the most is the headache that gave them the film because of the extremely bright, uncluttered, camera and fast and confusing cuts. I'm not against these types of stylistic devices if they're done exactly like proof Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh with most of their films, but in that case there was too much. It seems that the cuts and flashes that accompanied each flight over the city of Mexico and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is thin enough and everything was very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily figure out how it will end. For a film that claims to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt, it is beyond question that his story has been told so many times and with much more depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to watch a top action movie, I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the Denzel Washington character's killing syndrome and it failed poorly to deliver credible performances. In the first half an hour or nothing else happens, except that the archetypes and shifted cliches are portrayed, and when the action machine starts to rotate, it's so quickly cut off that you do not know what's really going on. So, the movie does not work either in a credible drama / thriller, or as a pure action movie. Of course the film is not as bad as some of the most disturbed blockbusters in recent years, but they do not quite understand why so many people claim that the movie is something fresh and so cool. For a video it's too long and a movie has too little substance.
