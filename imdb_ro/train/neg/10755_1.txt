I can not think of any redeeming aspect of this extremely poor interpretation of Asimov than in the direction of art. Take a look at product disaster, Will Smith's unconvincing performance, and gargantuan holes. This was not just ridiculous and painful to follow. Even the action was boring. A mixture of MTV-inspired production values ​​and an absolutely stupid dialogue that probably targets very young children. What a shame that sci-fi bad thing can be done after I had Bladerunner, Minority Report or a lesser degree Dark City (by the same director). It really is part of the bottom 100 list. Very horrible.
