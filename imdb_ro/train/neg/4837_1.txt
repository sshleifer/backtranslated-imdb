I went to see this movie simply to see what was all about the hype and I was just as disappointed and surprised at how it got 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb today . Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director who ever won the best picture and the best Oscar for such a really bad movie and I wonder why? The most unrealistic story of cowboy bomb removal is something for someone I have not seen? Why did I get the mental picture that this movie was a remake of an old bad West movie about a cowboy doing "courageous deeds" in the Wild Wild West infected with "evil" red Indians; but just that it was set in a different context this time? Has the Oscars been given because the director was former James Cameron and made it a gossipy story about daytime television to work? Or was it a kind of Emperor's Clothing Syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but could not say that, because others did not seem to say it out loud? that sniper scene in which they showed that the formwork casing falls in a super high resolution resolution to transmit a "deep message" or something like that? Something among the "EOD guys who are doing good snipers abruptly and will always get dirty terrorists"? Was it just me who felt there were so many pieces and pieces here and there in the film squeezed for no apparent reason? And can you get Oscars for editing and directing for this? If you have not seen this yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they're running on TV in a few years. You will not lose too much.
