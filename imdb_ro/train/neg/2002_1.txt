An unsteady hand room was used, probably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to get a motion sickness just from his gaze. It seems someone with cerebral palsy kept the camera (it's not an offense for those who suffer from CP, but I do not think you would expect to work too much like a cinema!) Working with the room was so hard and so of the fun, my wife and I, I thought it was an infallible, and I gave up after 10 minutes of torture. I checked some time later (it was on TV) and it did not improve anymore. I suggest you give him a wish if you do not have to get rid of any bad sushi he might have eaten!
