The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old and my girlfriend was 18. I was the age when action movies were our best to enjoy the best (ok 2). We retired feeling so insulted, we wanted our money back, but time could not be regained. Editing is what killed this movie. While the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached, the film completely insults the public's intelligence by having these bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets at the truck. Please, missiles on a truck known to carry plutonium? What's worse is that these VWs are able to get 15-18 shots from a 4 rocket launcher. You would see VW with 4 fire rockets 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last attached, come back a second later, with two missiles attached, fire another, then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full of a set of 4 rockets. We tried to hope for a great finish that never happened. Apparently they just got money and stopped. Just ridiculous.
