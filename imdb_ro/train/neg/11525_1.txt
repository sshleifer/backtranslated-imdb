Simply terrible! Why would not you use real actors? Look, this has to stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want a credibility or a message sent through these low-budget films ... please, for the love of God, use real actors! Most will work for free ... take advantage of it! Now, back to my comment ... anyway, the humor was lower than that of the variety and it was not funny at any level. As for quality ... in a scene shot on a public transport bus you could see the crew's reflection ... guess what? He was a guy with what he looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. I guess the only audience for this movie is gore fetish ... and not even a good gore.
