Primal Species comes from the legend of B movie Roger Corman and as such, everyone who follows this must realize that this is a low budget B movie and knows it. A bunch of high-jack terrorists a truck and you kill a whole army, they do that, I think they're gonna keep uranium, but they do not ... ... contain two Dino with a taste for human flesh ... Then a Crack team, which could be called Delta Force,. OK, it's not the Jurassic Park, and Da Dino's are never seen clearly because it's obviously a guy in the Costume that's not so different from Barney the Dinosaur - just a little bit terrible, but it comes to boys this was about 1 % of the Jurassic Park Budget and as such does its best. Worth this to be at the bottom 100? .... HELL NO !!! I think almost half of the voters who give this 1 are WAY WAY excessively harsh, is much closer to a 4 ... is actually much better than a whole series of other movies that are not in Bottom 100 and has a production value similar to Sci-Fi Channel production. (again Films that have a tough time from critics here on IMDb) The actor is as expected in a B movie, although none of the actors take it so seriously, nor is the script written. <br /> Everything is a pleasant B movie - not for movie snobs ** from *****
