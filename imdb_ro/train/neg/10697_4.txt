First of all I thought it was wonderful to say in credits that the story and script were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the best Hollywood scriptwriters until his talent disappeared and retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was basically based on the story of Robert Louis Stevenson "The Bot Imp". A good man is in possession of an evil object that will offer him any desire, but which eventually will hit him in hell. It's fine. Nobody said that scriptwriters must be original. The actors are generally quite competent given the mediocre writing they need to translate on the screen. The biggest complaint comes from the end. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a different way, trying to save an innocent person. At first, this seems to have worked, but true to modern horror movie code, they feel they have to offer a last horror dollop at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. Older horror movies did very well, allowing the hero to win at the end. There is nothing wrong with the good triumph over evil, no matter what the current producers of the film producers think. You can give the audience good health and still make them happy at the end. In fact, I think it is preferable.
