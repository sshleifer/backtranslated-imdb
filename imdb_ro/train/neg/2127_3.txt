Why? Because for some reason, there has never been a more adventurous scene in any movie than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She repeats again at the end (in a different mood!). So wonderful. Rent it and see it. Even if that's all you see. You'll agree, I'm sure. Everything about the original was so great he did not need a remake, I'm sorry! Jason and Vanessa made commendable performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all actors and singers in this new version give "everything," but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - it just can not be done! It's even annoying that you think of comparing the two minds while trying to appreciate the remake, and do not blame the actors.
