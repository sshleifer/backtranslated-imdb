I bought this exciting movie a glorious free room over the fun blood bath. I did not get anything. This movie is virtually unsuccessful at all levels, not at least scary or funny, it's just horrible shooting and never offers the audience anything worth seeing. What is so bad about being so brutal, violent and brutal as he had promised to be, is very little violence. Basically, blood and no emotion have been shed. Action, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I could barely stand by this total garbage; I certainly will never want to pursue it again. Do not waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; is really the worst movie ever made. If I could give it away, I would do it.
