I saw this movie a few months ago in the city that appeared in the movie as Greendale, the only reason I went to see it. Another locality that was there posted me a repeat e-mail announcement because the first one sold and the people returned. Its editorial comment in front of it is a good summary: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are not a Neil Young fan or you live in / near 'Greendale' (in case which since you know the real name), skip this movie. It's mostly a trip to the ego for the director. He has no discerning plot, music is fine, and too much of the lyrics are incomprehensible, making it impossible to track what kind of plotting pieces there might be. a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give them. I would give this from 1.5 / 10, but that's just for the fun value of watching the locations made in a movie. It's not worth $ 6. I could rent a camcorder and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie. If you want to see a good * environment * movie, no message, do not rent Koyaanisqatsi.
