The guys in this movie fooled me. I really realized that it would be a horror movie, with absolutely no humor in it, boys, I had my cold shoulder at that moment. This movie was, and I'm true, pretty good. It was not scary at all, but the angry philosophy and humor even went mad at this exciting film. Some of the crimes of crime and crime were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I liked it. Killing is vague about snow sports and Christmas, which made things more interesting. The angles of the POV camera were great. The film is about a viscous killer who dies in a collision of a car crash with a chemical truck while he was transported to prison. He is later resurrected in the same chemical with snow mixed together. These were the ingredients chosen to make the snowman a perfect killer. He takes revenge, as a snowman, by the police officer who condemned him. This movie had a bad attitude, except for Christopher Allport, which was fun. I will say that I am rather disappointed that this film was not a horror, but actually a dark sitcom. They had a wonderful story with a good plot, but it was not executed correctly. Everything I like the movie at first, but now it's very annoying. But this movie is much better and darker than the sequel.
