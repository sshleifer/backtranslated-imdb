Although I am generally a supporter of the well-done film, I am not limited to films that go beyond these limits and, more often than I, I enjoy and admire the films that manage to "break the rules." And it is true that director Pasolini violates the rules of cinema. But also, it is my opinion that he does not break them successfully or at any real point. Pasolini's work is visually visual, but this is less a matter of what is actually on screen than the way it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the amateur motion picture result. This is the case for DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors and, while many directors made it with a remarkable result, in the direction of Pasolini, non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to shock, offend or distract the public. Such elements can often be used with surprising effect, but in Pasolini's hands such elements rarely seem to contribute effectively to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. It has been given to me to understand that there are many people who like it, even admiring Pasolini's films. Even so, I never met one of them, and I could never read anything about Pasolini or his deeds, which made the reason for such pleasure or admiration easy to understand for me. Judging only from his deeds, I think he was essentially an amateur director who did not "break the rules" as much as choice and lack of understanding - and who was initially applauded by the intelligence from his days of "existential boldness", thereby simply confirming his bad habits as a film producer. I find my work boring, unimpressive and demanding. And this is also true for DECAMERON. Unfortunately, it is true that in almost every film Pasolini was my mistakes to endure.
