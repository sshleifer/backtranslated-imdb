This movie does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why his most common name is Robot Wars and not the alternative name Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars. Robot Jox was basically a fun movie to watch had a nice premise of the giant robot who are fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film and, instead, has a totally boring story, which besides this is not very original or intelligent. A shame tried to be so different from its predecessor, otherwise it could have been a fun movie to watch. Like "Robot Jox," it's a B movie, but with a big difference it's not really good. Perhaps this must also be the case with the fact that Robot Jox was made in the 1980s when B films still had a certain charm and class, although the film was released in 1990. This can not be said about this movie. It's just lame, bad done, salty and not quite interesting. It also has an end that lets you think "This is it? Is that all?" What the film lacks the story is indeed a true dash. Perhaps a good offender would have been a good idea and other things, such as a real point about the story, some good action or main characters. Seriously they thought when they chose the actors for this film. All of them simply can not be liked in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if it were the gift of God to the woman and Mr Perfect who can compete with anyone. Have not even managed to bring the actors from the first film? For such a futuristic film, with a concept of having big droids in it, this film is definitely lacking in its action. If he had put more and more action in the film, the movie would have been at least one more fun to watch. Instead, we now have a movie that fails to impress in all imaginable ways. You can better watch a "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" episode for more action and more love. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
