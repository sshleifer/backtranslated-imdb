Nowadays there is a tendency to look at all the shows from the 90s as classics (people are so lightly blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of these performances were / are, without a doubt, good, this is simply stupid. I saw a lot of shows in those days, since she had a lot of TV shows at that time, and I did not like it even in my childhood. Even an elderly eight-year-old can see how much Power Rangers are going through and how much the FX has suffered even then. When the show does not resort to the painful scenes of "battle", it hits the spectator with this useless soap opera about a group of teenagers and has little social problems from time to time. I do not know about you, but I did not give a rat ass for any of these stuff and the stuffing until they had to "fight" again with some guys in a very clown foreign suit with fireworks or some toy-robot toys. You never feel "involved" in some way with this show and the fact that most actors act like they would not have any interest except that they have a wallet just increases the feeling of feeling. /> There is nothing memorable about this show, and quite surprisingly it has received so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). Everything is just a quick way to make some money. We challenge any "fan" to tell me what's highlighting in the episodes that should be so good because we could not find anything that is even appealing to children. I think most Power Rangers' fans would tell me I do not "understand" anyway, or something along that line. I really do not care; this was shit then and still shit now.
