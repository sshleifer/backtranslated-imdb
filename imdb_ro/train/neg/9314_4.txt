Well ... on the whole, this movie was almost devoid of value and is basically a horror movie that has become more of a comedy. I hired this movie last night when my friends and I went to the blockbuster looking for a scary movie. This was definitely not what we were looking for, but he thanked us for humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially to Tracy whenever he's in the dining room, telling the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they act. And also when the clown looks at that black paper thing and grabs Mark, he does not even show he's scared, even if the clown grabs him and attacks him. And seriously, would you be JOGGING if you were banished? I would have sprung for my life! (Even if someone could probably overcome that clown because it's like 300 lbs.) Not to mention that the effects are not as big as every time the clown removes Susan's head into the woods, throwing his head in the palm of the room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws his head back. Also, as in the commentary of the previous type, the beginning does not make any sense, and I do not even see why it was even included in the film. So what did this movie do in 2003? Music has made it sound like it was made in the 1980s, and the camera (?) Does not really look professional. Half the time, it seems that the room can not remain stable even when it is supposed to be. Overall, I have to say I liked the movie. I would not recommend it, though if you try to find something that scares you, but if you're looking for something to have fun or laugh at, I would certainly recommend it.
