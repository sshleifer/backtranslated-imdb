The "documentary," and we use this term apparently, sums up the fact that Muslims are trying to take over the violent world. Then he says that any Muslim who does not recognize this is neither ignorant of his own faith nor in your face! Also, every person interviewed in the film found a market for their ridiculous reality by selling clapack to the conservatives willing to let others think for themselves. What the WEST must know is that it is nothing but propaganda that targets mental miniaturization. If you are looking for a real documentary about Islam and about the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that offers more points of view from qualified sources.
