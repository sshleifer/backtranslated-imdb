I saw the movie last night at home, but I thought it was too long before all. Secondly, the things I've seen in the movie were too far from the text to have even what I thought it would be a comedy movie like the rest before. Things are not funny in the movie: the fiance hitting his girlfriend, beating. The movie was too long - it talks about the desire to go to bed and wonder when it will end when you wake up and you're still playing! Some of the things at the meeting were too many to surprise - like the lady singing - I felt like almost watching a spiritual song show here! come Perry, you can do better then!
