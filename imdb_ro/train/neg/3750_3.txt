I finally came to see this experimental Lynch experiment after I've waited so long ... and unfortunately did not deserve it! Even for Lynch's fan, I found it so tedious ... nothing happens, there are tough, long, long pauses, where nothing happens, long and monotonous speeches where nothing is he said, and everything ends with the viewer who does not know or did not care what the hell was talking about, what happened before and what happened thereafter. <br /> <br /> There was a Mulholland Drive hint - the blond girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita - and a moment of the Lost Highway alluding to a significant event that happened but can not be clearly spoken . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing is happening, it is very forgetful and I think I will delete it from my computer and I will forget that I have ever followed it. I'm sorry David!
