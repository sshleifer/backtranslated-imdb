A disappointing film. The story set us the protagonist as Chrissy, a "young", quite outrageous, drifting, not doing too much. In fact, she does very little to move the story along so I did not feel surprised to see the focus concentrating on her relatives. It's a pity, however, Chrissy seems to be an interesting character. The story was predictable and sometimes quite formulated. So the question is now when we see the Champions, Jacksons and Tamahori's breaking ground with convincing stories, cinematic stories that will inspire rather than have fun for two hours? <br /> <br /> Technic, a disgusting film.
