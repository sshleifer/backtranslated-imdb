So I'm looking to rent a DVD and meet this movie called "End Game". It's James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has a summary of a political thriller taught. Well, it's worth a look. That's what I thought. The boy, I was wrong. The end of the game has almost the most ridiculous plot ever to have sustained dissatisfaction. Now being a kind of a whim, I can not really break it as I wish without "destroying" those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions such as "Why did they do that?" And "Where did they make the necessary resources to do that?" are very abundant after the hilarious conclusion of the film. As for the actor - do you know those movies in which you almost feel that an actor realized they made a terrible mistake in signing a movie, and this then shows up in their performance? This is one of them. Accompany yourself with a ridiculous and seriously erroneous scenario, an irritating direction and a recipe for kinematic poison. Of course, this did not get to the cinema and for the same reason you should not leave it in the living room; it's terrible.
