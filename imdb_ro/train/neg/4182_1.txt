This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I'm accustomed to seeing gray CGI blockages and special effects of amateurs, such as near fake blood, that make it very obvious that blood is strawberry syrup or other syrup variants. However, I thought I saw all the possible minuses the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie. Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? These are the main foreign vampires in this movie. You can clearly see your fingers inside the rubber socks. A handful of words comes out of the courage of the victims, and the vampire who is on the vampire hunt team can talk with the rubber socks of Transylvania. How did the vampire aliens learn from Transylvania? And is not Transylvania in Romania? So you should not speak Romanian? Why would a small town have their own language? If you can suspend your reflex and move the rubber socks with your fingers moving clearly inside the heads of the strangers; then you have to deal with the other foreign vampires. There are "skin" who want to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are just the ugly ones, which all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are annoying Valley Girls and their friends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so they can sabotage defense systems so these space vampires can attack. Finally, if you think all of the above is fun and deserves a laugh, you have to take care of the third distribution network of the Television Network that rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes who are constantly fighting between them. Why should almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie use shameful characters that are annoying, abrasive, cruel or simply unsatisfactory? I woke up hoping the rubber socks would talk.
