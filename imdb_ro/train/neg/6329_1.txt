I saw this cinematic misfortune in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when the tickets were sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever made (with my friend, while the idiot that is the sketch "Laser Bra 2000" was on the screen). Obviously, my reaction and my friend's reaction to the movie was a common one. Not that we found the film offensive (be it an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is awesome of bad and obvious careless, lacking even the unintentional humor that makes Ed Wood to be watched. This is the real reason why NBC refused to air him, rather than not understand Mr Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to lead the supporters of the bankruptcy film). I was surprised by this day that this film does not seem to have made any list published "The 10 Worst Films of All Time". Sure I do mine. You were warned.
