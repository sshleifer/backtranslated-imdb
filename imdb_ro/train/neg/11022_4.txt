In his own way, Mr. Foe (original and more appropriate, headlined by Hallam Foe, I do not see it refer to his title as "mystery"), is a tribute to good action. Both Jamie Bell and Hallam, an attractive voyeur / creep physique, and Sophia Myles, as well as Kate, her partner in sex and fantasy, are convincing. The problem occurs when you try to connect roles to whatever happens in real life. A young man who spies intimate details about people's lives, as Hallam does, would be worth a pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be dismissed and frightened-she would probably call the police. However, these things do not happen in the movie. Hallam's poor mother died, and his father married a woman with whom she had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and let her know. She's having sex with him. Kate is a kind of employee who places Hallam in a dishwasher and plays sex games. He looks like his mother's birth. Everything ends happily with Hallam "solving" his problems. Forty years ago, the brilliant play and cinema, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, had an equally optimistic ending, with the characters becoming wiser and better after they broke one another. The problem is that it does not always work like this, especially when nobody cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is plausible due to the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mr. Foe, emotional revelation never happens.
