A kind of family parody, mixing "One Officer and a Gentleman," "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other films I can not remember now) in a rather boring movie. Gags are always where you expect them, and Damon Wayans' lines are predictable. As I said, unfortunately, this movie never surprises you ...
