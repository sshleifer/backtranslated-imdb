Of the ten actors portraying Philo Vance in series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personalized, but in this scenario, the audience is long before the famous detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, looks into space, obviously hypnotized and says something like "I have to travel and be killed," I felt it was still that no one took it after He died. Police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After the murder of the owner of the dog, Lock Lockhart, was shot and killed, Frieda Inescort did the same thing, saying he would go out to be killed, then walk dead on a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally yelled, "I got it," as if it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was intelligently hidden and there was a considerable suspense when the party began to hypnotize Lowe to make him jump off a roof.
