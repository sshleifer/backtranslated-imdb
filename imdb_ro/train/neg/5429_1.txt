The movie starts with a beautiful song Same with a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking in a suspicious way but suddenly we are forced to make a comedy With stupid routine idiots such as GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like raised children Their scenes are funny first and then get bored There is a plot bored by Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end of the movie trying to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets really bad Then a time long for bashing, by HERA PHERI and wait, there's also a long watch in Payal's house The movie is so boring that it makes you fall asleep Priyan's direction is a very bad music (Pritam) is a routine except the first song The cinema is the movie has a cheap look all year round Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he goes to pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not too loud and above the other movies But no, He becomes his usual self and becomes irritating most of the time Tusshar should not speak in a movie, his quadrant delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace He is the only actor to act very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult But does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less application and is usually Payal is a non-Murli Sharma actress is terrible
