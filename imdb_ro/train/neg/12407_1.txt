Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes live in a babysitter for young Rosalie Cole (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie loses her dead mother and constantly visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> Start with a really dazzling sequence in the cemetery ... then break it down. The story is thin and there is TONS filler for the movie to last for 85 minutes. The actress is terrible along the camp (Cole is easily the worst). Badly pointing to some of the most important edits I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are just cut without any rhyme or reason. The film also has terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. As for blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what it looks is incredibly false. I have never seen such a fake blood - look like ketchup! Puzzling, useless - filmed in a justified way. You can skip this.
