As a Southern Baptist, I suffer that I have to give a rating below the average of a Christian film. There are certainly not so many who want to discourage filmmakers from a poorly exploited genre. However, I have to say frankly that "The joy of living love" is a low-budget, low-budget film, consciously believed. Plot is predictable, mediocre (I'm good) and atrocious editing. As a television movie it may have been a bit over the average, but it's a long-awaited film. Keep trying guys. You have to have a movie about the real Christians in you somewhere. Do you suggest that you address G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for inspiration?
