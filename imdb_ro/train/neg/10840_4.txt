It happened to me that I love the show that grows, along with millions of others. So I gave this film, thinking if it is not good that it could be a little bit orbiting and fun. WRONG! Should I ask myself, at the end of this, that Charlie's Angels are really boring? I do not seem to remember that. But this movie, as bad as movies of this type may be, does not look much like the enthusiasm of that time and show. I have seen everything, despite the negatives, it was not indescribable. But it was very gentle, which I do not blame at all for the performers, especially the women who played the angels as they really looked like them. The movie was not so exciting. He tried to make every angel a "character". (An angel is feisty, one is "good girl", one is her husband ...), all the characters have been portrayed with a major feature that defines them and a small depth beyond stereotypes. The interest of the show was lacking, and the dialogue was ... dialogue. That's pretty much. It's not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But omission.
