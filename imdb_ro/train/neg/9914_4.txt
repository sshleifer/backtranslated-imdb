This film approaches the child from the point of view of a mother (lisa Hartman Black), who behaves like a man in a thriller of action. Unlike other films focusing on the Police, my mother follows her former husband who kidnapped her son. Help her lawyer who, in the end, falls in love with her. Before going back to her son, a lot of bizarre things happen. My mother tries to take a child that looks like her son from a play of local children to a community theater. She is caught and then realizes she is not her child. Only that could have put most people in the psychiatric ward or a few months in prison waiting for trial. However, in this film, Mom is released after several hours because the victim's parents are sorry for her. A few moments later my mother leaves in her mother's house and then the police arrive and have their guns directed at her, but they let her run because I recognize her (and sorry for her?). <br /> At another point in the story, they found the child, but when the police get to look for the house, they seem to have left the door behind and entered the river in a boat that the father, such an emergency escape ! My mom gets someone to borrow a cork and even if she had to take some time (in a real world), she and her boyfriend with the lawyer, and the police get caught fast on the other cork and it's inverse in the water on land. Instead of getting out of the cork to look for my dad on the ground, Mom assumes she drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees her life jacket. Of course, she can not swim and sink like a rock. The lawyer saves her, but she misses the chance to run after her father. At one point, Mother was told her son died at a clinic in Mexico. He and him go, and where stops no one knows! In some respects, this film really exploits the kidnapping of the child and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman doing all the crazy things people do in such movies is fun (or funny?).
