How can you say a horror movie is terrible? when you can not stop laughing about it, of course! The plot was well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things about the hilariousness of all this. Some reviews have placed their location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was on a random island in the Pacific. Where this happens, it seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is set up by a few black women, some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa who hit drums ... The devil God is a big black man with a terrible pink eye. One of the most "groundless" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered in what appears to be an orange substance that they suppose to be blood, starts screaming for a few minutes on and on (actually funny), and then his partner's head falls into the ground and "Pablito" strikes him a bit for what I suppose is "noisy" and his eyes are moving ... <br /> <br / > But of course, then "weird" is gone when you realize your eyes moved because the movie is stupid ... I did not laugh like in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a beer case and start watching this movie, you will love it! If you are looking for a real horror movie or gore, though ... it does not "bother".
