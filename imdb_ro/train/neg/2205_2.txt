This type of plot really has a lot of potential, but it was buried here. Honestly, I felt the cheese element at first, but I thought it would improve after the grotesque birth. Hey, I'm wrong! A mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag with his old friends before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's very bad. I should have numbered when the rubber shark masks glanced behind some foliage, but I would probably have missed the number. Go to the legs of your legs to show them how the shark finds people. I do not like being fed with every aspect of a horror movie. Oh, and after being almost killed by a mutant shark and pulling around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a man who recites Shakespeare ... This is one in which you will be rooted for the monster ... if you can stand to look at this feeble excuse for a move.
