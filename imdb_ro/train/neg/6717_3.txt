It was a terrible God. The story was everywhere, and most of the times I was confused because of the horrible editing. I did not feel any sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial people without any size. Scrub, stewed stereotypes with subplanes that did not go anywhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, even if it looked decent. I do not know what he was trying to do, but how shocked am I been when I showed this garbage on Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You'd think a channel like this would look like more quality movies. There are many, much better homosexual and lesbian themes. "Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who drove my mind at this point, but what I'm trying to say is that this is not worth it. If you catch on television, well, but do not bother. There were maybe three or four photos that looked very nice (sad they can count on one side) otherwise the cinema was pretty crappy as well. Enlightenment was far ahead in many places. I think some of the effects have been used to try and add something that has just had nothing to do. I can not refuse Johnny Rebel is hot enough (without blonde hair of course). Too bad she did not do anything for me. Stick to porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
