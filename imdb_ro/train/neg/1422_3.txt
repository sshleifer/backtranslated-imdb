The original series of Lensman novels is a classic of the genre. It's about the pure SF adventure with something (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood did not shoot it verbally because it's just the kind of thing I love: massive explosions, super-weapons, uber-heroic, girl, extraterrestrials (high potential CGI), good vs. bad in the purest form etc. Instead (and I think I'm a lover of Japanese movies and anime), we get this awesome movie of children that destroys the courage of the story, mixes in Star Wars (ironically, as the last one broke the books from time to time) paste and pull everything up to "Thundercats" level. To see Kimball Kinnison, the symbol of the Galactic Patrol officer and the second Lensman scenario portrayed as a little boy is pathetic (etc.). I can not understand why the producers did this because they obviously had those rights to the story and could have made much more money (FAR!) Telling them right. It makes no sense.
