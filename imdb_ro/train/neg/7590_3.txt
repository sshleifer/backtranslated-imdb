Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and roomwork, pretentious dialogue, banal plot. The first donna name, Camilla, and the frequently occurring eponymous flowers are enough to remind us of the similarities in the novel from Dumas La Dame aux Camelias, Camille's film with Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor and last but not least the opera to Verdi La Traviata. Beautiful women, not very virtuous, out of society for one reason or another, loved, broke up, gathered in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal parks and a stupid unrealistic dialogue in the work, but why Hayak's waste, Don Sutherland, a beautiful interpretation of LA in the 1930s, an earthquake of ex machina that conveniently kills the other woman and all the beauty on this mediocre turkey in which there is not even a beautiful singer?
