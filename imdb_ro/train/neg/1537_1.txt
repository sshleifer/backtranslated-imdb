Really bad shot on film "film" made by one, not two, but three amateur video producers. If you are going to make a bad horror movie, at least throw in blood, gore and nudity. There are some blood provided by latex cut props bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and prostitutes, but not nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they just talk. There does not seem to be editing effects - fades, tissues etc. Once upon a time a bit of black seems to separate scenes. > <br /> The terrible music of heavy metal heavyweight troops, whose sites occupy the majority of the final credits. The roles are represented by rubber masks attached only to the actors' faces. Do not even bother applying brown makeup to my neck, arms or wrists. The 10-year-old warranty with a video camera could put together a better film. No reason to buy, rent or watch this movie, unless you can not make a low budget video.
