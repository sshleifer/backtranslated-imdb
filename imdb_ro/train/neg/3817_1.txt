Seriously. This is one of the stupidest family shows of all time. Plot - A family without a mother and 3 "fathers" raises 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters - Danny's frightening Christmas, Joey-loving cartoons, Jesse's obsessed hair, Michelle's bravo arm, poor DJ and Stephanie almost normal. The creators of this show really want to hate the characters, do not they? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show. I really chuckled a few moments in the whole show running, and I think instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a much worse torture than anything else. 1.5 / 10 or: D
