DOC SAVAGE: MAN OF BRONZE (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible and horrible film ... based on the pulp / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super heroic hero of adventures in the 1930s and its five assistants, all the specialists in a field of effort that allows them to fight evil. It was a fairly hockey series ... but it was pretty fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a cinematic version in the '70s, with Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had a chance to see it. He never played in the theaters where we lived and was never shown on television. Now that I've seen the movie, I can understand why. The statue and the characters are not treated seriously ... it's all sort of language in the cheek and campaign ... just like the old Batman television series ... except without the benefit of being fun ... or having any vision fler. Corny dialogue, special cheese effects, silly stereotypes, frightening action scenes and bad action. In fact, it seems to me somewhat fascinating in the wrong ... what could she have thought? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored to play the role of a modern remake ... but I can not imagine it would have been much better.
