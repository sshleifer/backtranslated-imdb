It was almost impossible to say that this movie would be a bust, but I was really disappointed. Being a connoisseur of the cinema in Pekinpah for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it worth a shot. The opening credits, symbolic to the fans in Pekinpah, have the intersection between man and animal, but here we have a non-diegic environmental noise of children playing in a school while a plant is planted. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the perp, Caan and Duval, travel to their next mission, Duval threw the bomb on Cann that last night had a STD, found only by snooping through the purse, while Cann was intimate with her. The next laugh is fantastic, and it is clearly granted homage to Brian Depalma, Dressed to Kill, at the expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the credits are opened, the film is collapsing. Even my head Alfredo Garcia has a stronger production value, a bold appeal to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as extra course material, but once finished, he transforms The Killer Elite.
