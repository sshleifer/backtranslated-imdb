I think I agree that many of the comments here must be false. Even if the movie is not necessarily bad, it's certainly under the media. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions that haunt you. The movie starts with two stories that have no links between them, even later. A couple loses their child, who is found in bed. They move to a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is haunted, kind of like. From here, Dark Remains begins very slowly, with some scary moments (the first ghostly appearances are beautiful, and the succession of the flashlight worked very well). OK, then ... The woman sees the daughter's ghost, other ghosts die of accidents or suicides, man tries to solve the secrets of old houses, the woman becomes depressed, strange neighbors appear. She was pretty much there, but the premise that this is her own emotions is nice, so wait for the twist. There's no confusion, you're just confused by a history of the haunted house, a strange neighbor, a creepy prison, no point of death, and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo idea that reminds me a lot of "shutter". The end is ridiculous, because when you start and finish a movie, this music is also slow with piano music, quite lame to include hordes of ghosts at once that look like a zombie, of course just to return to the rhythm slow piano and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make a short ... Dark Remains could have been a frightening fantasy story if the script did not try to go everywhere and get anywhere. sense and contradictory in the film's basic atmosphere. And besides ... do not use abandoned prisons again. It's so worn out, and in that case it does not make any sense at all. "Hey, there is this scary prison, it lets you shoot there." I think a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains have been thrown into this mix.
