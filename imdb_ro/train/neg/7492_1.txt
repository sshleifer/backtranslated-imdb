Apparently, the greatest spectator knows nothing about Europe's history, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the era of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten attempts across Europe) was a vengeance and an injustice to the winners. What do you think, why were not American, British, French or Soviet indicted after the Second World War? Was there no US, British, etc. war crimes? There was neither Hiroshima, nor Nagasaki, neither Tokyo, nor Dresden, nor Hamburg, nor Berlin, nor Katyn, and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg, justice was not a reality. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (This was also a book title in America, 1941.) This film is a terrible, ignorant American brainwashing tool, full of error, lie, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But it is not surprising ... Why was not the Nuremberg process enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total dark after 60 years! This darkness (and hate and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would become envious of her ...
