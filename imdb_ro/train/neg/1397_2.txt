Let's see, here are the "most important" ones in The Brain Machine: 15 setting pictures of a pool and a house; 15 Establishing photos of an unknown office building; 5 countdown by a weak technician; 7 closures of a threatening guardian; and a multitude of technical stutter that tells us it's a high-tech experiment. Various posters commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the 1977 release date on the DVD. It's easy to explain. This dog simply stood on the shelf released for five years until someone broke it, thinking it fit perfectly with the post-Watergate state of mistrust in the government. After seeing The Brain Now, my only wonder is that he was ever released!
