Of course, Parsifal is not a work that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favorite of me, Knappertsbusch, especially 1951. Syberberg's approach is so static. Whenever music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the distribution moving at the same pace. Stress and Klingsor are endless. What happened to movie editing? The result is physically exhausting. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to hurry home and play back a record to confirm that Wagner has succeeded, Syberberg was wrong. And the decoration assorted with the "intelligent" memories of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will it ever be a viewer of this film without previous knowledge of Wagner?
