This aunt adaptation a classic aunt that is loved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has no idea about the different nuances of Rochester's character. I have the feeling that he never read the book, but he stumbled across the set in his tight pants and received a character summary that read "Grumpy, perverse, dirty past." He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as a cruelty that never cracks a smile until he does not get involved, in which he turns miraculously into a feast. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this delightful adaptation in me was the ingratitude and also the sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who surely turns into her grave. Go and draw the book. ROCHESTER HAVE A PERSONALITY. AND THERE: A "PASIONATED" LOVE SCENE does not mean you have to eat your face.
