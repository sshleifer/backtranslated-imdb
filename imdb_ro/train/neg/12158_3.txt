.... it may seem much farther ... but there really is a real-life story ... of a man who had an affair with a woman who found where he and his new wife, his wife, lived, doing it would sound like a murder rape ... ... in her deception she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him ... so she left her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota. ......... The last time I heard she was in a mental institution, security prison ... she still wore the "engagement ring". that she bought for herself ... and told everyone she bought her for her. The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and the murder occurred in Minnesota ... There was even a feature story in the "People" magazine ... Spring 1988, I mean page 39. I remember this as if I were in college at that time, and a colleague of mine met the individual in the Security Hospital.
