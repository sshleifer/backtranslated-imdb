How did such a terrible scenario succeed in attracting this distribution? Ridiculous, predictable and incredibly incredible, this is well suited and thin, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the worst thrillers I have seen over the years. Amazingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of a cast.
