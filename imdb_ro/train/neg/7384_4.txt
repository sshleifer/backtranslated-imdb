STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconciliation mission together with three we young strike recruits after disobeying a direct command from above. However, the night before the strike, everyone was found killed by a seemingly inhuman killer. While the French police dabble with their own investigation, he goes looking for the responsible ones himself, only to discover a corrupt fraction of military affairs in a new deadly drug that alters a person's DNA and gives them a new, terrifying force. > <br /> Inappropriate cover. Bad title. Poor post-production manipulation. And bad trailer. The film is pretty bad. But, I have to say, I do not think the Force Attack is even the worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other commentators here (maybe not Steveday!) But I think a lot of criticism came from all the bad news that went ahead of the movie and not the real quality of it itself. <br /> <br /> I have to say that there is no duplication or editing of the ropes, as I was right to believe. Dubbing was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a swallowing problem!) It was pretty awful and quite common, but it was not used for such a big part of the movie as I thought . The land was running pretty well, taking into account everything that happened with the previously completed film called Harvester that continued. Also, as another commentator pointed out, the film has a beautiful Gothic look, a new touch for a Seagal movie. The absolute low point of the killer, however, was the total and total lack of any interesting action, with only a few badly filmed scenes for any fun. I have to be honest, yet I'd rather look at this again than the Fury Flight, Today you die or go out for a killing. **
