Yes, here are great shows. Unfortunately, this happens in the context of a movie that does not seem to have any idea what it does. In the first 45-60 minutes of this moment, all the music takes place as a realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour inside, the characters who have always talked to each other, start singing each other suddenly. To confuse things a little further, from nowhere, they actually have a 15 minute dialogue, then they seem to give up this idea and go to other things, such as a number that starts in a club jazz with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen section of string. Besides this inconsistency in the way music is used, it is the clear inability of composers to write music in the style they are supposed to be presenting. While the first two tracks resemble the Motown sound of the 1950s, the rest of the movie is just Broadway music. Then there is a pure fool of fragments from a group that makes a family imitation of Jackson and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When Stevie Wonder began to channel, I could not laugh aloud. It was clearly one of those movies that made me appreciate how little time I had on the ground and I replied that I was wasting two hours of watching this movie.
