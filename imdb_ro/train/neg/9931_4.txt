The Black Angel is a minor minor, and Vincent in June as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after being found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the wife of the woman killed) decides to help Vincent find the real guilty. Peter Lorre has an invaluable role as a suspect. This noir movie looks and plays like an inexpensive programmer without ever getting anything special. It's nice enough, but then at some point it makes no sense, and the solution to the mystery causes one of those big reactions "give me a break". In the end, this could have completely reduced the film, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good. Vincent is a wonderful heroine, and Durya was never really good to play good boys. I like film, but it was a real disappointment.
