The poster that called this "Plopless and useless" literally took the words that I would have used in my subject. The only thing I would add is "passionate." For a movie made by a married couple and a lot of graphic sexual scenes, this film manages to do what should be a soul-filled situation in one beyond the cold ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during sex scenes, and the spectator might take a Valium and do it with him. Also, the public in the audience saw too many buffers used during their time, and any guy who's started to see if Willem Dafoe pulls a bloody swab from his wife's vagina needs therapy. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the film (if any) is the scene of the restaurant where a waiter explains to Dafoe completely sleep-minded what is a "jambalaya deconstructed". (All the ingredients of the antenna separate rather than mix together.) This movie is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: scary house, isolated, dead husband, scary violins on the score, strange caretaker coming and going as he pleases, death of car accidents and near deaths, characters with a secret past. Practically every thriller clich√© you can think of, but nothing comes together. Everything stays there and never enters into a coherent plot or even a piece of artistic mood. At the restaurant, Dafoe passes on "jambalaya deconstruita". People who want to do this would be good to leave this thriller debuted on the video store shelf.
