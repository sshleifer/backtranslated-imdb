While I do not agree with a commentator who described Charley Chase as unfortunate, in this film he is certainly. It's a shame because I suspect that the other reviewer should have seen only a few Charley Chase duds and assume the guy was not funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and what prices GOOFY? are very good Chase movies, so it could be very funny given good material. Unfortunately, in this film he gave absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of Oliver Hardy as a foil is no help, since the basic premise (the boy wants to marry the girl but the girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, as I really wanted to love this movie, but it could not. By the way, for ordinary people to look for Charley in the mid-1920s, you'll be quite surprised because Chase does not use glasses or mustaches - and looks very little as you'd expect.
