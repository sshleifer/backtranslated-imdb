If you are following the real story of the early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - however, if you are after a reasonable ripper with a theme of art, you have discovered that you are a film. <br /> <br /> This film is such an inaccurate representation of Artemisia Gentileschi's life, which almost made me cry. (Enter Artemisia inaccuracies in Google and check out some of the articles vs. fiction articles.) However, from a technical point of view, the movie was fine: sets, costumes and, in particular, light scarf lighting helped create a year 17 century experience; although the FACTUAL FEEDING FACILITIES mentioned above disappoint a little. I wonder how queen / co-writer Agn√®s Merlet defended the movie at the time? Maybe he refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate, because she left her in front of her, she was.
