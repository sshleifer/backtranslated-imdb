Blonde and Blonde was unfunny.Basic, it was a version of Dumb and Dumber, but no more fun, and they used too much background noise and music. I WANT MORE PHOTOS AND BASIC MUSIC IF M-ALETINE !!!! It starts extremely boring and TOTALLY inane. It does not lift the pace anywhere soon and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense continued. Perhaps the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 seemed somewhat fun and interesting as it came to the end, but that was the only part. I also could not help but Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard's characters a little. Even though this movie had no laughter from me, it kept my attention. I would not say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better movies to spend your time and money more than Blonde and Blonde.
