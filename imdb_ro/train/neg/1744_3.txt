We watched Malayalam "Boeing Boeing", made in 1985 (which, in turn, is probably inspired by an English film of the same name). The basic story of the masseuse garam is the same - but in a pathetic way, classic banknotes replaced by routine banners found in normal Hindi movies (perhaps the director did so to suit the taste of the Hindi audience). . <br /> <br /> I did not see the original in English. But he really enjoyed the film Malayalam (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a comedy split sideways. Of course, the action of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of the chef) was so natural and spontaneous. I'm probably too overwhelmed by the Malayalam movie that I can not tolerate even the smaller flaws in her Hindi remake. But I still believe that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overcome. Paresh Rawal did a decent job, but he did not get to Sukumari. But everything is OK if we compare it with other recent Hindi movies.
