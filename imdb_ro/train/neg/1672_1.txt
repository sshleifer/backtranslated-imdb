This is the only movie I've ever seen, which made me write criticism on any website, and this is a significant statement from someone who likes "The Attack of Monolith Monsters." This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless film. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I think this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be distracted, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults could easily recover their sleep in front of the TV while the children are watching this movie. Do not be surprised, however, if you wake up to find out that children have stopped the TV and started a game aboard. As an adult enjoying fun, enjoying everything from world to fantasy in realism, drama, comedy and action, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate imagination, this film has nothing to do offer.
