It's not exactly my genre, this direct action action on DVD is one that I just met because of a friend who put her on it while I had some beers. I'm relatively open, and a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to enjoy myself. Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-cone that becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons, which eventually unfolds as the movie progresses. Blah blah blah. What a boring movie. Do I understand that movies like this do not rely heavily on the plot, but they have to behave in such a stupid, predictable and stupid story? Maybe it's not important, but with an empty throat it upsets me. Better no plot and pure action than a sneak peek. Infused with a completely ungrounded feeling and feeling uncomfortable, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin turkey skin filled with rotten coatings. Perhaps I should mention at this time what is, of course, the point of the film's drawing: the struggle. Even in itself, the fighting is quite weak. The bones manage to take out street fighters, well established, in one shot (one or two is trying to fix this inconsistency); fighters who do not seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a bad game. Even this is repetitive and stupid, broken arms and faces hit with a steady curse we see again and from time to time. A movie run, a movie by number, that deserves full direct to DVD status, making absolutely nothing new and everything I've seen from time to time. And not even good.
