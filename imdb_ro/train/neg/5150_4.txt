I received the DVD from the library hoping to have a good idea of ​​how things unfold in the background to a great production of the opera. I have to say, I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets of a Wagnerian production must necessarily be elaborate and impressive, and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we give him a bunch of moments of people moving around large landscape features helps vaguely along with a comment that has not caught my attention. I found myself listening mainly to the background music videos of the works. I was impressed by the tremendous enormity of the effort required to make such a production - which has happened quite well and next time in the opera I'm sure I will remember that part if this video - but it left the feeling somewhat deceived by the lack of some comments and detailed explanations.
