I'll start with what I liked. I enjoyed the songs very much, everything about them was great, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything. I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene. But that's about it. too much is too much. Too much silence (it was exciting for an hour, but two hours of hearing and thoughts from time to time, indeed ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how I do not think they shot a porn movie there, but really, really too much.) I really think the cinema should be watched it certainly can not be tracked in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for songs.
