I want to be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (most notable in Early Edition). Since he usually played the good guy, I wanted to see him as a different role (out of curiosity). And the plot itself attracted me; a wizard (Tony Greco-a.k.a., Mr. Chandler) has to kill a person by chance before he trusts the life - or rather death - of a witness who will testify against a person in the "family." The movies were not as I expected. He was sick, I hated the end (if you saw him, you would know why) and there were so many unnecessary parts. Practically it was dirty and it did not make sense. Yeah, it was a mob movie, and give the weapons go BOOM. But it's more than a movie. This movie acted as if she had not had time to go into detail - just to deal with it and to understand it. The actor really played for him - James Belushi was quite funny like "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel be as credible as he could get. I was surprised the most. And Kyle Chandler was as convincing as a new-eyed at the "family." If only the script has done the actors right.
