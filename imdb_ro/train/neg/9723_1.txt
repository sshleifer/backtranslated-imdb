Jeux d'enfants or the way the movie was misinterpreted in English Love me if You Dare is a movie made by stupid men and fools. I do not know how I can expect something worth looking at in a movie with such a plot: Two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something (certainly extremely idiot) to prove each other (wtf?) That they are "bad guys". I know I overlooked some aspects, but that's what the whole movie means. They become older ... and instead of realizing that there are only a few odd weirds going on to do their mad things, thinking they are good people. Can you expect such a Hollywood movie, but France? It is even more offensive to watch the movie in the country that created Amelie a few years ago, which, however, the movie tries to show but is far away. Avoid. Avoid.
