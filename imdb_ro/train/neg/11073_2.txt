This is very bad and terrible embarassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT YOU ARE MORE HEALTHY! This is not particularly bad. It's typical and usually bad, shot in hotels and public parks with thin directions, high school level and "gee whiz ... lets see what this button makes on the room?" photo. If Michael Moriarity was so intentional to make an impersonalization of Jack Nicholson, could not at least make a good confession of Jack Nicholson? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver, really one of the most beautiful cities on earth and a yacht building center (part of the "plot"), why on behalf of God we leave this endemic inferiority complex Canadian to dictate that Seattle is disguised ??? Not only are I angry at this movie, I'm embarrassed and more than just ashamed. Australians give some splendid things. We produce pretentious piffle rate second. Gawd !!!!!
