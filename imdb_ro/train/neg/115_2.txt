Never shoot models and Playboy bunnies in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, about which Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to marry SISTER after her husband's murder, is a thousand times more interesting than Dorothy on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is neither an actress. I expected to see some kind of lost masterpiece at Orson Welles, but instead, I received Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-terrible "poodlesque" hair-do .. .. Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could watch again and again. This clunker was barely able to sit once. This movie was not released because of the brouhaha around Tawdry's death Stratten; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
