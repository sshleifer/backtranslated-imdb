I hated this movie. It was absolutely horrible, poor, poor, MARKET acting REALLY REAL REAL, stupid criminals who were not even LEAST BIT cheats (as opposed to the first 2 movies that were very good). all boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuse for the poorly copied ideas of the first two, which only means that people writing this movie were just lazy as their salary did not exceed $ 20 a week. This movie is absolutely stupid, it's not worth even renting. In fact, you do not even see the tv! Go get your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! BAR BARI give 1 star (out of 10). Just believe me when I tell you, if you liked the first two, and you are not an absolutely stupid person, you will not like this movie, do not watch this movie!
