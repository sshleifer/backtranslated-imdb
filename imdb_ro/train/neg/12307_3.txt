When I say "Doctor Who" you can create an image of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee or perhaps Peter Davison. When I say "James Bond," you will surely create a picture of Sean Connery, while a small handful of people will think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sgt Bilko," everyone will think of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs to only one actor. And that's the problem with this movie version you'll always want to look at the old black and white show. In fact, the whole idea of ​​making a cinematic version of BILKO without Silvers in the lead role is approaching sacrilegation
