I can not believe that such jilted, jingoist material is passed on to Americans as art. At first, from lines like "we want to make sure we play for the right team" and the framing and manipulation of lighting, A Love Divided shows the real girl. The way in which Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, Protestants being peaceful and defeated, is as poor a representation of history as the American Westerns describing the struggle between the cowboys and the American Indians. The truth of this story is distorted by the stereotypes and total vilification of Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by filmmakers! It is sad that today's people still believe they can gain moral influence, making a movie so recognizable for the obvious intention, so far away from trying art. This movie has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.
