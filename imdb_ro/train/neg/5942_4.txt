If this should be the black experience, let me go out to the front or back door. A boy of a mother sees one young woman's shoes one day, and then he's all over the hill for him. Angela Bassett, the one who shines in this movie, plays her mother's protection and religious background. In spite of her anger over how life was transformed into the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept it. It allows friends to enter and suddenly it is okay to use profanity as long as it is not in front of the children. This is a sad state of affairs related to the rap gangster. You knew where this movie was going. I literally cried aloud when, at the end, when Bassett accompanied his son's body for burial, he said that while his life was interrupted at the age of 24, he had become a man. What a man? He was a convicted murderer, he wrote the most harsh rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. This scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what is happening in our schools. Total and total lack of respect for the teacher. Rivalry on the east coast, rap gang coast is not fully explained. All we see are guns. A terrible image that does nothing to prevent gang violence. What horrible models are these rap singers and their bad music. The African American community should take brilliance in their very being. Who was this fat, greedy fat guy playing Biggie? He made Rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison. I know that Bedford Stuyvesant's streets have changed this little boy into a vulgar monster. What a bad state when it's called movie entertainment.
