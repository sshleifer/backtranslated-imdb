This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played Need For Speed ​​games it is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This is true for Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars. The act seemed forced and scripted, the premise was the best at best, and the plot was almost non-existent. I really saw this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was bad enough, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just wish I had shown Eddie Griffin crashing Enzo somewhere in the movie. Generally, you do not pay for it, do not get out of the way to see it, but if it's Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
