In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Airplanes, Trains and Cars," which was a hilarious comedy and full of battles? the best thing he ever did. Ten years later, he again reduced the recycling of the "Home Alone" plot to this second sequel, which is not related to the other films, but it is just as uninspired and sadistic. The four brothers? That's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change in series! ?? are electrocuted with metal chairs, arm with nets and orbits with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new baby is even less charming than Culkin. You would think that the departure of all key players in the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilizing the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he did not even return to "Home Alone 4".
