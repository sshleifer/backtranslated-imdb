I do not see how someone who likes Van Damne might want this movie. The film actually starts with promises. I would say that the action scenes from the beginning of the movie are excellent. Action scenes with the family, trying to save twins, are a wonderful beginning and a good advantage for the main story. However, the movie is all over the hill. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. These are brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus teach different abilities. A brother should be qualified in martial arts, but the other brother should be qualified in firearms. How convenient when it takes time that a brother who never took a weapon before all suddenly is a great athlete, and the brother who did not learn any martial art suddenly makes the division and the high kicks. br /> <br /> The park, action, etc. I'm simply ridiculous. My favorite scenes? As for when Van Damne faces a soldier armed with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of seeing and shooting at Van Damne, he makes a war cry as if he were using a warrior and running it. Van Damne continues to pick up a gun from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still 75 to 80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of correcting a decent fight. Barrels were dumped at Van Damne as Donkey Kong. An absolutely aggravating film that had so many promises. If you're a Van Damne fan, save your time and see Hard Target or one of your previous movies.
