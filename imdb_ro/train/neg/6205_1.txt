So they shattered the violence and were marked as sick. Well, violence is the best reason I'm afraid, but, unfortunately, the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they happen with their ravages (entirely foreseeable). This movie has a really terrible scenario. We never have the chance to know Robert and his actions at the end are simply pathetic. The act is not much better, not even the worst of them being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, fast enough to send you to sleep. And what's the school movie project on earth? A comment about the movie itself can? Using news during climate crime is ridiculous. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals, but they are hopeless in depth. As the earth took the great Yorgos Arvanitis to illuminate it, I will never know. And how they got their money first is an even greater mystery. Absolutely terrible beyond understanding.
