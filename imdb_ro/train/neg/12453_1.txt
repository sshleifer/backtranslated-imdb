I have always been a great fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to see it. I was disappointed disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie just in name. correct suit (she must have refused or ordered major changes) and the plot runs like a poor James Bond. There is not one of the things that made the success of the comic book "the heroine," the superhuman power or the determined will. It's just a long crazy dream. I do not even think Cathy is so appealing. I would not waste your time with this.
