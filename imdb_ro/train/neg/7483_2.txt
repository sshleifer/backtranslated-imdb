One might think (like me) that, with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should at least be decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) produced some of the funniest comedy works of all time. Well, it seems I was wrong wrong - this is the only one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I doubt that one joke after another can be so profoundly unpleasant. It gave me the pain to watch these talented actors perform one of the most positive scriptures I had the misfortune to meet. Based exclusively on the big name, we have remained hopeful for a long time during the movie, but never managed to offer any kind of entertainment. Normally, with both movies and life, I try to get rid of biased comments and generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to let go. I can count, on the one hand, maybe two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions that have left me bitter than that. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. I tried to enjoy it - I even did. But those outside cities are finally failing. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, take your money and watch it while you wash it in the toilet. Just do not watch this movie.
