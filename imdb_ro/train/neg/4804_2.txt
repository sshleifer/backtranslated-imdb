I do not see a lot of television and I've come across this show. Reality shows? I hope this is not real. If I were a man and I had such a dog and married someone so old, that would be the reason for the divorce. I think she sets a bad example for how a person should treat a person they love. This is one thing that is wrong with our world now, so many people in bad, selfish relationships and do not know the significance of what it is to really love one another. It is self-sacrifice and not something that should be on merritt. This does not give a very good feeling, to look at what should be in private counseling. If his personality to the show is real, then he deserves a better person who would show true true love and care for him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or made for evaluations ???? I really want to know. Frankly, GB
