We rented this movie because we hoped it would be a whole family that would enjoy. Although the film is family friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of God. If you obey God and follow him, you do not guarantee success. The football team will not always win. You will not get magic better. Infertility is not always healed. You will not always get a raise. Sometimes you will be stuck with the old car. God does not exist to satisfy every whim. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify him most when things seem to be bad for us. To live is Christ; to die is gain.
