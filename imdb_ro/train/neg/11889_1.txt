Very fun to watch "Beretta Island" as a kind of natural movies. It's the answer to Jess Franko's b-movie type. : incredibly viewable scenes look even better than hand-to-hand battles. The fall of ridiculous scenes. Saving incredibly stupid beauty scenes. Erotic scenes are very unertical. The main luck of the film is the beautiful landscapes and festival scenes. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and the list of Franco Columbu's relatives at the end. Special attraction: naked breasts.Almoust forgot - Franco can sing!
