Just recently, I was obsessed with anticipating this film so much that I almost had to see it. Well, after I just saw it today, the rating of 5.8 is completely understandable. I think if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a terrible need, it does not seem worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cold and well-developed story that binds well with the product itself, but everything is so indulgent that it becomes so hard to follow. And if it was not for Wes Craven's production on this movie, there would be nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But it all makes you go "Should this be horror or COMEDY?" because there are a lot of high, random, random and random moments (IE "There is a hand in trick!" or "O mother," I will kill all the cursed sons! ") and the act (God I do not remember not even how bad it was.) STORYLINE: (This part contains spoilers, beware!) The film starts with a woman who gives birth to a mutant child (ooh la la!), then the screen fades in black with the title of the film a monologue appears And then we go to this office where there are randomly placed veteran war veterans of people looking for mutants The need to keep track of the audio feeds has disappeared and everyone dies After this opening, more of the military training in Baghdad, while the captain guards them "A good job of stupidity," their last day of training is in New Mexico, the desert in which the family of last mile remained were blocked. , things are going In the end, the people die and ... must I tell you something else? Because now I have a great attention to gold that only forces me to sit here and write this. The thing that is wrong with THHE2 is that it does not work. There are no flashbacks here, and the end is pretty sure ... but with a twist! One fool, I mean. I'm pretty sure the Cut Cut Cut Director with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will present all the alternative terminals, but at this point I'm not sure if I'm interested. <br /> <br /> So by all means, if you loved the first, so much is a sin to not see it, then, by all means, to see it. But if anything, then, Avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
