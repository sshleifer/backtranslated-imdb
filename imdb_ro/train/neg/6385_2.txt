Gayniggers in the cosmic space are almost summed up by his name. Running only 27 minutes, describes a space ship of gay blacks coming to Earth to free men from women. While I see a small significance for the plot, it is also really illogical. Granted, his goal is to be a comedy / spoof about society and science fiction. I woke up laughing several times, so I get there. The special effects are horrible. When the spacecraft floats above the Earth, you can see the star's zoomes for no apparent reason. The asteroids are fake at first, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several mistakes in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are embarrassed; In general, everything is not taken seriously. If you go over all the aspects that make it a bad movie, very accessible and easy to see until the end. Some parts are hilarious. But, as a whole, the only thing you left to remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts in history. Seeing it as a short film and having some funny aspects is not the worst thing to see. But it is illogical and has a low long-term value. I can not really recommend; if you follow it, do it for the unique concept, not quality.
