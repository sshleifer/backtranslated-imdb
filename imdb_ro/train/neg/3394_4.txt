This film has Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England, who orders a bride from Russia to mail, receives Nicole Kidman in correspondence and receives more than negotiated when, surprisingly, she is not what she seems to be. The story is quite predictable, and Chaplin is thinking too much about the point where he somehow becomes somewhat. Kidman is really pretty good in this role, making his character the only thing in this movie that's interesting. Grade: C
