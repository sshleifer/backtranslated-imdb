One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is the making of a well-known and classic story that makes it a complete bastardization. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes over the story of Phantom of the Opera and moves it into a mall in the 1980s. However, the "Phantom" goal is now simply to take revenge on those responsible for deforming his face and killing his family. Special effects give a good chicot, especially when body parts begin to appear in dishes from the yoghurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as unpleasant as we would have expected, especially because fifteen minutes of MTV's fame have not arrived yet. If you are looking for good laughter at the expense of special effects crews and crews, check out this movement. Otherwise, keep searching for something else.
