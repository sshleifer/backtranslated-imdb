This movie did not age well. Perhaps it's just the impact, artistic characterization, action and direction I've seen with the Sopranos, but I've just seen the Prizzi Prize, only on DVD. The viewing experience with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different, but I have to say that I was just frightened at the end. Not just violence but the simple idea that in a way it would be a satisfactory end. I'm glad of a good shooter, but this seemed so devoid of character ... Also when was this move should be set? All cars seemed to have been from the 1960s, and yet World Trade Center towers (finalized in 1973) were clearly visible in many urban scenes. Another way in which the film grew poor is the simple idea that a passenger could travel the coast to the coast with a knife on his person. Somehow, the audiences of the mid-1980s found this charming and funny movie. In the mid-eighties, you find a delay: only you can live.
