It was everywhere with slashers around 88, so it was time for ries offs from those older movies. The brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrom, but then in a darker way, as I said before. The act can go through it. But the effects that make you laugh, the so-called Brain is indeed a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes the movie worth watching, the hallucinations are really wonderful and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm street, remember the live phone ... Some how do you keep track of this move, waiting for what continues to happen. It is visible to all the oddities there, because there is no gore in it and as it said that the blood is not there, but there is nudity for the perversions. I've seen war movies more than that, just wanted to make more blood ...
