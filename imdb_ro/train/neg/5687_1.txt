Although not as bad as its adaptations from game to movie, this raw piece does not work well. Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does not make good movies. One of these days he will run out of money and will not force the world with his bombs. The act was sub-par, the dialogue sounded as if read TelePrompTers and Boll's "little touches" were seen throughout the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll's movies, it should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
