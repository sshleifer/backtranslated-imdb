This must be one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive. Some of you really like this movie! I saw many Dracula movies and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, I said, "What the hell is this?" What a bad movie. Now, Dracula becomes who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty he hanged himself. You gotta fuck me. This is the worst reason I've heard why Dracula has become bad. Who asked for a reason anyway? What piece of film is this movie. Who ever came up with this bad apology for a movie should be beaten. Even Dracula is horrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you did not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Do I have to impress my title? Do not waste your time or money on this garbage.
