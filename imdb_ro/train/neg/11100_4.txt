He loved the original story, had great expectations for the film (especially since Barker was looking for him in interviews), he finally saw it, and what can I say? It was a total MESS! Targeting is everywhere, the act was atrocious, the flashy choreographies and choreographies were just flat, bare and completely useless (what happens to generic music video techniques such as fast-forward nonsense? film and cheated the vibe in a MTV / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video. While some of the murders are pretty cold and brutal, some ridiculously ridiculous (the first Japanese girl's killing was hilarious, and Ted Raimi's death was just badly funny.) He simply hurries everywhere with a zero tension and suspense, totally departs from the original story and then returns to her in the end, which henceforth feels often tied I did not give any explanation, that is, I knew what happened only after I read the story, but for those who were not even confused, sometimes I did not even know where it was going and what it was trying to do has been going in a crazy tangle all the time. God, I really wanted to like this movie as I'm a big fan of Barker's work and he loved the story, because he has a huge potential for a cracked film, hell even liked some of Kitamura's movies as a fun romps, but this movie has just been in love with amateurism and humiliation from start to finish, I have not cared about anyone or anything, everything has been hurried and was severely cut off from the current source, turning it to the whole. Granted was unlucky, and Vinnie Jones played a bastard, but everything was everywhere, more than disappointing. eviscerated
