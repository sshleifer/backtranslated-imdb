This is the second time I saw this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be stunning and dignified movies. But the rest of Welles' career is unfortunately scattered on materials unworthy of his talent and too weak to resist film embroidering. And when he does a bad luck like Shanghai, the lack of a substantial thing to cling to his film tricks is just kind of sad. I could not tell you what to explore here. Everything is as handy as Welle's Irish booklet; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects have become excessive and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a project similar to the project. Material is not important. It simply can not bear the weight of the whole noodle. For a director of reality-based drama (as here), he never feels any pull to bind his sweat beam back to reality; or a coherent story. The killing-for-hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos for Welles, though, because Hayworth cut his hair and got that performance out of it. The room loves her. She is the most classical, more luxurious, more charming and charming fatal women ever put on the film. But her betrayal comes so late in the film, it feels like a desperate decision, made to have the film fit. The movie can not be saved by a noir convention unfolded in the last 60 seconds. When everything is said and done in L.F.S., convulsions are all for what? to convince you that you saw something thoughtful? to give Welles more? to make you blush your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity at the scale of a story, nor can he tell a story straight. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a terrible billionaire, arranging a four-fold murder scheme in the cross, or a fanboy in love with film connotations of no significance or substance. <br /> <br /> Overwrought, absurd, unengaging.
