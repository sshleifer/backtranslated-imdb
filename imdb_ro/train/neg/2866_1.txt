No word can describe my total hatred for this awful betrayal of the BTK killer. Rate this movie one of ten compliments this really disastrous excuse for a movie. From the beginning to the end, there was no single highlight. The whole thing was put in a terrible way; scenario, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A series of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which everything is put together. This review may seem unfair and unfair to a low-budget movie, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I just saw, started to boil my blood. As this film has ever been awarded production rights, I NEVER know. I'm almost tempted to recommend BTK, because it's really a stand-out about how pathetic and worrying it is. I can say honestly, in all my filming years, this is the best. MOVIE. EVER. I lost over one hour of my life on this unnecessary garbage, and I enjoyed jumping from the nearest building beforehand if I knew what I was doing. ZERO from TEN.
