I do not know much about Tobe Hooper or why he makes his name in the title, but maybe he should not have bothered him. As another commentator mentioned, there is not enough horror or erotic to bring fans of each genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free, and most of the act is so. Englund does all the best with poor material, and Zoe Trilling has a very good ass, but none is enough to wear this movie. This is a tape. Grade: F
