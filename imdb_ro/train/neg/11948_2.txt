The horror of robbery of a classic. It was not convincingly written why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He may be more stable until they start playing with him, but he still does not help his actions. (inviting a stranger to stay alone with him in his recently abandoned motel, telling the attractive young man of past mental problems, lying about knives, etc.) This, in addition to his previous knowledge, should have kept Mary extremely cautious of him, but this does not happen in a way, so he can play the game "error kill" later. Which itself is ridiculous: "That's the real killer - plus herself - too!" There were too many contours to borrow a story on the screen when the narrative did not have to expand. Perkins is once again taking on his famous role, but that's just the only little pleasure to have. It's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you're not going to try and get close, then you do not have to worry about it at all.
