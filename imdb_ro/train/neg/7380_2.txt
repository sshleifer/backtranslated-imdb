I think Seagal's time to go quiet in the night. What I just saw is doing all of it directly to the video in recent years looks like its early kicks 90 in comparison. A secret lab is making a new type of drug that jacks up the human adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something like that. Somehow Seagal should stop the infection or the end of the world ... or something like that. Seagal has also gone through strike teams like jellybeans, every time I look up he has ordered a new face, so it's hard to follow the character's development as well as I know Steven's athsma prevents him shouting at the tip of his lungs, being constantly called by people who do not sound like him? Typically, film plot and action sequences can save it from a total loss of time, but this was not even close. As I said, it was more of a horror movie, with much blood and whistling, rather than a direct fight. The problem was that it was not really scary, and Seagal seemed utterly helpless because the infected people had to have a speed of light movement, but seventy Seagal had killed them alone? I think the only highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes that the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
