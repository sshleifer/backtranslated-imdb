This is a high-bending movie to a relatively well-defined group (of which I am not a part). I went to a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - eventually it seemed disappointing to me. The history of a Hungarian Jewish family, terribly dysfunctional (often "twisted"), is not a cup of tea. Such an epic saga should give the viewer something more in the end. Ultimately, images like this refer to the human state - this image does not cast almost any new light on any of its more significant facets.
