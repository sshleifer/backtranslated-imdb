I read reviews about this movie and decided to make a shot. I'm an open guy with my mind and I've done good reviews of some pretty bad movies. As the final credits rolled over, I looked for meaning and something nice to say. Here it says: "This movie was right short." That's all I got. Good good. The sets and pictures were well made and music helped to make a mood for the asylum, but the movie was painstakingly watched and the endless dialogue took it from the good bits. I laughed at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who was embarrassed in front of a big crowd. Until the "chicken dance" at the end we had just decided to put and roll with the film and let the bodies fall down where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. The act was not bad and it seemed to have a budget, but there was no way to be supervised; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have done a doobie or a lot of beer to get the full movie experience. Anyway, I'm not watching the film unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say to myself, "At least I was not in Tarr's Torture Road. I'm better than these guys.
