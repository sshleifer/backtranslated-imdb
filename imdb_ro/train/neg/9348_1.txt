I found this embarrassing movie to look. I felt like shooting the story on my throat as if I could not lift the subtleties I needed to tell a voice to tell me everything for me constantly. Having a father who is still alcoholic, I did not really feel it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, real alcoholics are people lonely in, in my opinion, of course. It's hard to tell, what the main character did not really have a problem, except that she had a problem saying I love you in a moment - what was a little effort to figure out the cold character. He was constantly surrounded with people! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that at one point I was not alone in character to have a feeling of loneliness and inner turbulence. I could not connect with the character and did not feel anything about my father. I did not feel at all when he finished, just the relief ended. Kevin McKidd is a good actor but he is not a lead! The orange clock was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, should have had three different characters or avoided adolescent scene and focus more on adult McKidd. In a good note, I felt that the boy actor was very good at the beginning of the movie!
