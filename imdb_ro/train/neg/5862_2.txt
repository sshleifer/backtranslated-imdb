Well, to answer a person's question about "why does not anyone remember this movie?" is because indeed, not that many people saw it in 1978 and has not been shown on TV since then. (If it's on a video that would be news to me!) Even in the time of comedy, sometimes mindless, which was the 1970's, the filmmakers had smarts to avoid this movie. Unless I love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "that" a lot! Paul Lynde was more fun on "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this moment in her career was laughing making jokes about the singer's weightless singer Karen Carpenter! Har-har Joan! It also appears that any "somewhat" famous name in the era is in the distribution. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later "Everybody Loves Raymond"). Anyway, a somewhat good idea for a story, a pregnant man instead of a woman is going to lose here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal prepares a prostitute for eventually losing virginity, but because he was "upstairs" instead of him, he gets pregnant! (A comment about women taking positions of power away from men). Crystal's stomach grows, he goes through all the female emotions and the feelings connected with them. Unfortunately, he is now an outrageous social outsider! He is attacked by a crowd who wants to rub it (I suppose). He is forced to go to isolation to have his baby ... in a barn. Or if you want, a manger (God only knows where it would come from! Ewwww!) It seems (not shock here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgotten, humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and a few interesting and relevant moments with Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it shoots long! I can not believe Roddy McDowell has signed! (THE END)
