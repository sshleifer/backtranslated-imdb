This was one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. Horror works, not funny at all, and just boring. I can only take all 10 out of 10 fav. all time movie reviews are actually the actors themselves in disguise. Idk the run time on this movie is sure it's listed on this page It's certainly felt like an eternity <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a challenging challenge, try to stay on this dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time as I did on this
