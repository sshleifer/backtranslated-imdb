The guys from MST3K should see this dog of a movie. This is basically a Hollywood hacker actor who can not land on any kind of concerts. And she has this strange obsession with the Taxi Driver movie. So, what makes this bad actor? She blushes her blond hair and begins to behave like a surfer of LA, in the naive hope that this will make him play roles. You will laugh at your head in so many of the inadvertent scenes of this movie. Like when the girlfriend's girlfriend's heart is broken and crying and saying lines like, "How could you do that to me?" And why cry? Because he dyed his blond hair and became a surfer for concerts. This movie does not make sense to ALL! The actor who played the governor at Benson is also in this respect and plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with a funny dialogue. This movie will break you, believe me. Are you talking to me?!
