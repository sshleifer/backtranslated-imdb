Director Jonathan Lynn made some undervalued comedies in the past, such as Greedy and Clue. This is not one of them. More like a Police Academy film than his inspiration, he interprets Steve Martin in the old role of Phil Silvers, an army sergeant, forever tricking the scammers under his superiors. But the idle life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base that is determined to catch Bilko in the act. Nothing really happens. Everything's boring. It's not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman gather some laughs through the effort, but they are all better than that, and it's painful to watch them work with so thin.
