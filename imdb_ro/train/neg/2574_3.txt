I know that movies do not necessarily reflect reality, but that's got my nerves. Perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho-mother" problem has been done too many times before (and usually done better), and much of the rest of the plot is also taken over. The action was not horrible, but it was nothing to spoil. A climax: I'm a long-standing fan of the General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH Jon Lindstrom. However, if you can overlook the false psychoanalytic part of it, in the same way that a person has to suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie could be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and some pretty low standards. I'm sorry I spent my time looking at me.
