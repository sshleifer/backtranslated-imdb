I'm trying to decide if jumping in a wooden helicopter would be more pleasant than that. It ends the destruction of what was once a classic movie. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns, and Sith, we have the death of Lucas's career. Wants to swallow Annakin is stupid to Vader? I never thought it was true. This film justifies these feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie has gathered until all that's left has been a toy parade. I have to go. I know where there are new rocks to throw. Do you want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT tied. Vader is not their Father. Duke Conteo should have changed his faces while he could still. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good for anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother to put him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. All the misery with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid bh Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If he had brains, he would not have come in an easy year by Annie, but she said he was doing what George Lucas wrote for her. What a beating!
