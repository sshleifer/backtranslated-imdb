Falsly acclaimed, John Wayne (John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change their identity to become Alias ​​Smith and Jones. Mister. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mister. Chandler should be "Rev. Smith," but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". Never one of them is as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; though, Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them in his career. Pretty blonde, Mary Kornman (like Anne), grown up in her days in "The Gang," is a great interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have some pretty cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's low-budget movies in the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
