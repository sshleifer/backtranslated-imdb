The only reason I do not give this movie less than 3 stars is that it's not quite like a movie like Manos: Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is that it's boring and terrible, no doubt British. The premise of this film sounds promising potential, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting. It was more a film about research funding and about beating than lasers. The actors were made of wood, unemoiled and aloof. Just like the love affair between the two scientists - which was just intriguing. I could never tell what attraction happened between them, because chemistry did not exist. I did not even know why the main guy who faced the melt decided to slaughter everyone he met. At least now I know that I should always give someone a proper hearing before interrupting my research grants, otherwise they rebel, killing involuntarily empty gestures.
