Some people may consider this film a work of art - to be able to express your imagination on film to create a film full of pain and antagonistic death. I personally think this movie is a disgust that should never have been released. This film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete loss of time, it makes you sick for the next few days. The frightening images shown in the film not only make you understand the air, but I remember and take days to forget them. Such a shame that people lose their imagination on such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has the purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
