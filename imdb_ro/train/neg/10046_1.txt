I did not feel impressed at Dante's first encounter in "Homecoming", it was not a horror story, but a clever political statement with the bastards. The Screwfly situation is the story of an unleashed virus on the world that determines the sexual unity of men to be replaced by killing tendencies toward women. The episode begins with a short film explaining how the mice were killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man is arrested when the bodies of the females are discovered in his home. I suppose this should show the beginning of the outbreak, but it is unclear because it is never revised. The episode goes ons for a while typing blah blah blah characters. It looks cool and mysterious, but the episode of stars get worse worse as it lurches forward to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
