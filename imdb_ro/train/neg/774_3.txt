This movie seems to have been made by somebody with some good ideas but who also never made a movie before and did not think that a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and I assumed it was hilarious. Instead, there was a bad plot about mind control and so many unhappy moments. And, to the end, Candy brought some of the most crucial lines I've ever heard before. So despite a potentially fun story and amusement story, we are left with an amateur and brutal film that is likely to be too bad for the average adult, though adolescents will probably find some laughs. It's really a shame - it could have been a lot better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy, it should have been great.
