I like Goldie Hawn and I wanted one more of her movies, so when I saw the $ 5.50 protocol at Walmart I bought it. Although a little funny, the movie does not hit her at all. Some scenes, such as a party scene in a bar, take too long and have no purpose. Then, of course, there is the scene of preaching at the end of the movie that gives the whole movie a bad taste in my mind. I do not think this scene was added to the movie. I do not like silly comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some of the 60 years burn especially! Finally, although I'm happy to have another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it really deserved the money I paid for it!
