An inexpensive SF thriller, with an almost total lack of conviction (a computer-controlled camera and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from the cosmic space is led by a single man and is very poorly guarded at night); and full of sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few performers, "I'm here for money." (* 1/2)
