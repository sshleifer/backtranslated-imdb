Cameron Diaz is a married woman with a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is good until an ex appears and things get a little more complicated. While watching this movie, I was asked several times why I was do this because the movie is so ridiculous and bla and scripted stupidly without any credibility. The audience does not even know what's going on ... Even the wonderful Cameron can not save him on a scale from one to ten.
