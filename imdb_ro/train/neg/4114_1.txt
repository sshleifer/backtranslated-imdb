There are some big philosophical questions. what is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why do movies make this stupid? The premise is absurd. Thre is a dimensional one. The special effects are overstretched. And the movie is an endless battle of the gun among some of the strangest Hollywood movies ever made. But then, if there were good photos, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there will be no more movies. Too bad it did not happen like that. She was tempted to disable it several times, I stayed with her to see how bad she could get. I'm glad I did it because (SPOILER?), Last line is stupid to crown the whole dopey, a grim scenario. It does not even deserve the second feature status at a third off-season course. Apart from the general horror of the film, I deeply worry about its impact on the young audience. The Americans are damned like that and then they wonder why events like Columbine are happening. This is a truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!
