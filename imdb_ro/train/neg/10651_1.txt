Want to know the secret to making a slasher movie set at a fitness work center? She just places the movie with beautiful ladies in super-tight training clothes and makes them knock and grow the floor as if they were in a gentleman's club. That's what the producers of this terrible slasher movie made and that gimmick kept me looking to the bitter end. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to go through the channel, it would have added another scene to the training girls and I would stay. Like a movie slasher, Killer Workout fails in all the categories I can think of. Like a showcase for beautiful girls working, it's a success. Strong recommendation to avoid, unless the thought that half the film is a great show T & A attracts you.
