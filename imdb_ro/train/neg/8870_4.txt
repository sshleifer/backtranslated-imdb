Stefan is an x-con who five years ago married Marie. Their marriage was stable until Stefan caught her and offered to do a courier service. Stefan's activity is a delivery of heroin from Germany to Sweden, which should go with ease. In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a Bosnian girl who has been sold to a strip club owner. Stephen does not like what he sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father, during the war, fled to Sweden, Elli now goes to Stefan in Sweden. To deal with the past, Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what. Finally, back in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than ever thought of by Stefan. This film does not seem to fit into the regular Swedish film class due to the fact that it was much Americanized. Queen Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it all on average, but the effects make the film too much. See also jugs for you. <br /> <br />
