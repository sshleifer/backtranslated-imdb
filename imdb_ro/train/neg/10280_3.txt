HeidiJean really saw this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Unhappy, weak and completely deprived of imagination and heart. I looked at this movie asking who the hell thinks Carly Pope could play the lead role in this movie! The woman does not have a detectable personality and offers absolutely unclear performance. Baransky was great as usual and offered the only modicum of everything interesting. Perhaps her involvement was the only reason why the project was lit green to get started. Maybe I would have expected too much for a Lifetime movie that played 15 days of Christmas, but I stood by believing that with a different director and a JJ reformer with an actress who could at least get sympathy, that would be could have been a pretty nice movie.
