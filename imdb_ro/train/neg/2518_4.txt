Think of a darker version of one of those children's shows, such as "Power Rangers," and you have this 1990 "Robot Jox" movie. A movie where you fight with giant robots, two people enter the arena and anyone who comes out in the country wins. Robots are giant and look like some slightly better versions of those shows, especially because they are less colorful, so while this movie is not good, it's not bad to look. There is how I remember two robot battles in this one, one that ends badly and the last showdown. There is a turn of the plot as a traitor is revealed, but ultimately the plot is nothing that will remain with you for any time after imaging. The fighting itself looked like huge toys in the ramp, but still somewhat fun to look at. This movie would also create some other similar-action movies, such as huge robots and the tournament. So it's worthwhile to do once, but probably not more than that.
