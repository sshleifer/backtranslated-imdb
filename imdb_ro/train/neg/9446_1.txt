An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful book of children. The brutal and inappropriate humor, some scary parts and a disgusting story about the mother's lover who wants to send the boy to the military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who most likely seeing it because of the book (3-8) years. Do not waste money, time or good judgment.
