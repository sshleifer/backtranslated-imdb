Before this film, I saw only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: "Le Notti del Terrore" (1981), famous for horror fans, for the unforgettable performance of Peter Bark and your friend Giallo Strip Nude for your killer. The movie was not a particularly spectacular play, but they both enjoyed their special way (and the fact that they were not bad). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite a bit of splashing and a strange free goat place. The story of a murder in a hotel where the casting and crew of a horror film resides during their filming is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin is not presented, the film is a a true struggle to sit through (took me four attempts to) with endless scenes of inappropriate characters who struggle with each other and make very few notes. The only point of interest for the film is that his producer, Lucio Fulci, used several death scenes to get his mega-red film "Cat In The Brain" (Concert AKA Nightmare). And if you've already seen the movie, then there's very little reason to bother with the massacre.
