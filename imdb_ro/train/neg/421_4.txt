My title above says everything. Allow me to become clearer. If you've seen the "Earth Planet" from the BBC, which I'm sure most of you have, then you will not want this movie too much. And I own all the discs on "Planet Earth" I've seen the review for this great movie, and I'm reading good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. Unfortunately, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw it was a Disney movie with BBC and Discovery production companies. And when the first polar bear scenes started, I recognized them on my home DVD of "Planet Earth". The film went on and continued and continued, my friends and I were very disappointed because I think 90% of the video is from "Planet Earth". I say 90%, because some scenes that I have not recognized. I have a feeling I just did not remember them. So in the end what this movie really is is a compilation of different images on the various "Planet Earth" discs, with a narrative targeting children. Yes, the narration is pretty old. Let me give you an example. When the polar puppies show off walking from the mother's chicken, the storyteller says: "Polar puppies are not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember the exact words, but it is so) So briefly. It is condensed "Earth Earth" for children!
