I saw my mom ... well, she did not kiss Santa; he has his hand on his thigh and wicked thoughts in his mind. That was enough to emotionally cure a boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was mad at the quality of the toys made and the lack of Christmas spirit. Waiting for a real blow, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies, and it was not nudity at all. What I want to like this movie, but it was too slow and really did not have a good script. I did not expect a great deal, but I definitely wanted an action. There was nothing.
