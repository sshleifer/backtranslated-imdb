The moment we started before, we knew we were in trouble! The premise is ridiculous at best. The story line was even worse, if possible. The act was rigid and the actors gave a sense of lack of experience. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. Lines were delivered as from a robot. I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was very incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a terrible movie to try and stage their returns. <br /> <br /> Continuity has been stopped by the whole movie. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I want back nine hundred minutes of my life. They can keep the money, but give me the time! What a waste.
