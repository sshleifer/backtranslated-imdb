This movie is nothing like "office space", except for the premises. The office space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, because I never laughed during the whole movie. Mr. Cornbluth is fast moving to Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's home so you can leave if you need it.
