I sat down with this turkey because I did not see it before, and because the premise sounded as if it had the potential. It was easy to entertain until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to throw the windows in the house, but the trees in the background are perfect in the upright position and do not move a leaf! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the bright light of the sun is visible, illuminating tree strings. At that time, regardless of the faith the filmmakers have made, they evaporate faster than the very rain in their movie. Too bad that all the hurricanes are not like this would surely help our homeowners' insurance rates here in Sunshine.
