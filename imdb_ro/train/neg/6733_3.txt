The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, though it is an understatement. This film does not just cry, it shouts loud enough to break the bottle. Andrew Andrew and Virginia Stone have made suspenseful, humorous thrillers trying to make you feel semi-documentary. Here, they filmed on the current New York venues with "real" acoustics to face the children. But the naturalism of sound recording serves only to amplify Stones maladroit dialogue and histrionica of the mouth of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. In a completely modest show, Stevens plays the electron whiz wife James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held in captivity by the extortionist Rod Steiger (looking bloated and bored) and his slim cohorts in a blackmailer scheme with a deadly bomb that Mason has unconditionally helped to build. Here is another example of the credibility of a criminally crippled brain of every detail, yet he was stuck enough to engage a drug-dependent degenerate like a subaltern. Stones's idea of ​​nail biting tension is to catch the Stevens hysteria alone with benzodiavinyl rapist Neville Brand, filling the dial with his sweaty and weak kissing. But work on the camera is so lead, and the Brand, so (unusual), it seems the effect is hard to get angry, even less so. The stones, a square pair at the heart, do not even have the courage of lack of conviction. The film, which ends with the portrait Steiger, watching Stevens on a track subway train, is as embarrassing as his heavy weight. With Angie Dickinson as the amoral friend of Steiger, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
