Sleazeball veteran Bruno Mattei is back with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei makes his film with a tiny budget - so he seems already obscure when he's recently released. After her daughter was kidnapped, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers are part of an international organization that directs champagne movies as long as exclusive customers pay well. The search for her daughter not only leads her mother in Europe but also in prostitution. He goes to bed with some boys to get clues. When she finally comes into contact with the champagne organization led by Dr. Hades, she becomes very dangerous. There is not much to say about this, even if the promise begins. The problem is that the movie is not as harsh or explicit as it can be expected from the director who made movies like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) It is neither stupid enough nor contains the amount of nudity and sex that keeps the viewer's attention. The plot is not so special, except perhaps for surprisingly many different locations across Europe. The end is extremely disappointing. The actress is not really remarkable, except for Anita Auer who plays Doctor Hades: She looks and acts extremely creepy. You do not want to meet her in a dark alley (or in your bedroom). Overall, SNUFF TRAP just appeals to the collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's good to see the man again on the helm: it was his first thriller in 1994, giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
