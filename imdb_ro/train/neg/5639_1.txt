I saw this film today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel, after hearing censored reviews, but I think the critics sucked only on Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen with many unnecessary scenes, ridiculously long, nothing. Besides Defoe, who was decent, the actor of the two and a half years of the film, including Giada, Defoe's wife, was terribly terrible (as a part of the bakery vendor dropped out of me). This film is pretty much less plot with a blade trying to be abstract and on the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if it only added some kind of shock value to the boredom of this movie. I'm sorry I'm so harsh, but really this movie is a precious loss of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this film is not worthy of cinema.
