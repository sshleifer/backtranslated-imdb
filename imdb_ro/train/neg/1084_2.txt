I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and director, although Robert Altman may be hit or wanted. In this case, it was a great desire. Altman's attempt to create suspense fell on Keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like "Dead Again," I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope he would not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen in the way of most Oscar winners. On a downward spiral, including actors in movies with money like that. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though the best show was not "Tender Mercies", but "Great Santini". This movie was really a great waste of time. I give 2 out of 10.
