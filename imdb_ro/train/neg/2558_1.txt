I had to review this for a website and I looked at it with optimism that it might be at least a strange and yet fun thing, and it did not even do that well. 666: The Child "is probably one of the most horrible supernatural thrillers I have ever seen (even worse than" Godsend "), with scenes that break out of The Omen without shame. The end is really very similar to how in which "Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and the story are just hackneyed. <br /> <br /> If these movies make money, I'm sad to see where asylum is headed.
