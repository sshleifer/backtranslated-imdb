I hired this terrible movie. The worst thing I've ever seen. I think a class I class could have done a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and seen some harm. Nothing scary, except that I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. The actress is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of garbage. The scenes of the hello house are so low that they look like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is if you want to miss a good night and the little money to rent this terrible blow. I prefer to look at the killing clowns of cosmic space as I stood in a bucket of shaving machines than to sit back on this flop
