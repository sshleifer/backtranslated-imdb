This film has had so much potential - a strong distribution, a reasonable idea and a decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of them was wasted. The story did not go anywhere, the characters were empty to say at least and the result was a very boring and useless loss of a movie. I hated him. Judging by the other votes, I am in the minority here and I have to be a kind of oddity. Still, I thought this movie was terrible. I had great hopes, but I was very disappointed. A special disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A kind of very cute "fixer" has a nice idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - pleasant, but nothing new.
