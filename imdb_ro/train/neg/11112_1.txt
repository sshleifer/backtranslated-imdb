Wow, how bad can it get. This was badly bad. Not in terms of gore - which was largely ridiculous by CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. The story was terrible - the lead character of the lead was a total joke. In a few nights of watching Vinnie Jones, he begins to become "haunted" to the point of crying when he shoots his girlfriend. Um ... are all this childish, suggestive and poor child in New York? The development of the character has absolutely no justification or point - and, eventually, you will laugh out loud at the foreseeable and absolutely absurd intricacy of its character. Goral moments were clearly a poor effort, with a low level of self-appreciation, to jump on the modern MTV style of gore wagon - all cgi, blood, but no real emotion. These parts were unintentionally funny - and divert attention through their self-consciousness - the angles of the game room, etc. Generally, this movie commits the offense of blowing another potential idea. What the atmosphere might have (until the stupid monsters at the end) will be destroyed in favor of "look at my self-consciousness direction." This film was not made for the public and was made for a resume - a deeply selfish motive.
