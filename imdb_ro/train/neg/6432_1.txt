The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a label for the senator, based on the public's ignorance of World War II airplanes. The rear pistols they face are based on a latch that prevents the pistol from the rear from pulling off the plane's tail, preventing the gun from firing when it shows in the queue. When the senator was practiced on the field one day, he managed to pull the tail of the plane. He could not have done this if the gun was properly aligned. The gun officer responsible for this admitted in public before a camera that he was responsible - he made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the movie did not report this fact shows how unilateral it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroying the reputation of a complex person. A much better program was PBS specially made on it. He was a hard-working, intelligent and ambitious politician who overcame the extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shot the tail off a plane was not one of them. The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the audience likes simple stories, one of which is stories, so you do not have to think.
