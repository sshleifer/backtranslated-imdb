This movement is slow, productive, cold, dark and without a plot or hope. It follows that a tried and true European formula they want to subsidize, which is never seen, but which critics consider to be an "important point". The film is valid if it is nothing but showing the huge difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans in terms of employment. In this film, men still take care of their injuries a few years ago and feel it is the government's duty to offer them a job. While in the U.S. we know we have to go out there and create value for somebody. <br /> <br /> Spain has never been so backward!
