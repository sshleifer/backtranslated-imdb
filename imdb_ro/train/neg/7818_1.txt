I usually do not go out of a movie, but I did it half way. This movie promised something different, but did I always think I did not see this earlier? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1, the space ship collapses and collapses on the ground, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this still manages to burn and collapse! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to develop landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we get to see another Woody Allen movie without blacks! Superman runs around salvaging people, making sure he battles in Europe and the US, does not enter the dark areas please. Maybe I could stomach this 30 years ago, but right now.
