Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually offers solid performances, such as The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. It also does pretty good here, but the rest of the movie suffers from a low budget, bad writing and such a beautiful photo. Miller-Movie's formula gives him a 4. Richard gets 5.
