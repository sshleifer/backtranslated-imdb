Apparently he intends to be a thriller of a movie is nearly defeated. It made me exclaim "God!" more than once at the complicated complications of the plot that were simply stupid. Fantasy or absurd locations just for the novelty or dramatic and unlikely situation, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too many to understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to discover how bad a picture can be then you will want to see it. Otherwise, dedicate a little time to forgetting dried paint for a more productive investment of time! (That a movie released in 2003 is already on TV in July 2003 could give an indication of the quality of the film)
