To quote the film, "It's better not to know, better to forget, best to be abandoned." Oh, irony. A ghostly story with all the technical refinements of a horror movie in Hollywood, but a scary dialogue after the first trimester of the movie and you feel as if you were preaching from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's as though the writer's cumulative dialogue can be summed up by bad political television and a Jerry Springer show. It fits, perhaps, for a film like The Hitcher, not a horror film set by Russia. The result is that a wonderful set of potentials and potentially large gore scenarios go to waste and become just stupid, not scary or significant.
