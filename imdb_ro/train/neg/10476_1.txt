I'm Christian. I have always been skeptical about the movies made by Christians. As a rule, these are "knowledge" when it comes to producing films. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a great job. The acting was horrible, and if someone does not know the Bible in a way, they could not understand what the movie was trying to do. Not only was the movie made great, but the people who did it even had some wrong facts. However, in this "critique," these facts are irrelevant and too deep to multiply. In short, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for the comical glimpse of daily scratches.
