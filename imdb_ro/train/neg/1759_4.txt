This effort was like a glitzy television movie ... I do not remember that this has ever been released in theaters ... If so, you must have died a quick death. Watching the DVD in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious that this film was not meant much more ... Ed Lauter a critic of art with a greasy polish? What a fun tower I must have been ... I did not see Ed at the "Longest Court" ... All the others acted pretty much through the numbers led by Baldwin, except for Pompeo ... She had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking through most of the image ... Pompeo's daughter had only one dimension ... she interpreted every scene as an adorable puppy ... the slowest line delivery of any age 3 years I have seen yet ... The stripping scenes gave me my wife and I headache ... too much rapid cutting and angles ... If you want to shoot a scene of chase in Barcelona, ​​you can want some WIDE pictures to exploit the beauty of the background, right? The whole story was quite implausible and extravagant, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
