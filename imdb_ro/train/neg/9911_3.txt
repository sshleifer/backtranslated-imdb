If you have dear actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio or other distractions. Massive talent is totally wasted in "Three Days to Vegas," with blame falling into the scene. My neighbor's holiday videos are just as exciting as the wrong road movie. If you want to see how to use a veteran distributor with a good script, check "The Crew". There really are no ransom factors here and the observation of these wonderful actors who struggle with such a weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the superficial script misplaced the audience, essentially giving the actors nothing to do. - MERK
