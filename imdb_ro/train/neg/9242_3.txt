What a fantastic premise: A movie about Berlin Airlift. They should have everything. Tragedy. Suspense. Camaraderie. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and heavyweight pilots in the USA. love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to get involved in John Wayne or so, but he does not manage miserably. It acts so wood that it should crack at any time. He tries to play the hard guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why will Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Because they threw stones in a lake? Because he's bringing bricks of coal? The SFX is very, very well done. Too many. The hundreds of planes above Berlin look more like an attack-fighter squad rather than an organized airplane? as it actually was. Interestingly, the White House office, the Kremlin and General Lucius D. Clays seem to be the same dark and dusty set. Observe the same curtains, hanging the windows deep, as if it were a shield to protect against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene dark and dusty? By the way, General LUCIUS D. CLAY meets as a small, uncertain, weaker general who trusts his own noble idea of ​​air. He was very much the opposite. So, combine all those individual bullets and the result is a movie that builds up without passion, without suspense and without historical precision. Sad, has it started so promising?
