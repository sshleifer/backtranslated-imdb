never had a movie led me to write a review, but that was just dire. stuck with her trying to find what it was about this movie that made snoop pick it up as his first serious but honest role It was a bad choice. he did a good book, but he certainly did not work for me as a movie. I found it incredible, devoid of the atmosphere and I found many of the scenes hidden stylted.a musical master he can only be a serious snoop ain't.the acting actor acting by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was acceptable but not enough to had a weak, weak dialogue. maybe I just lost the point but for me it did not fit into any genre, it did not generate any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense, actually I woke up praying for the end and smelling a deep the desire to tap all three of the main characters!
