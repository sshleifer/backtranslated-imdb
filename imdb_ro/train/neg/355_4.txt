Just Cause is one of those movies that at first makes you wonder why it was so hard to cut when it came out - nothing special but quite competent and with Ed Harris's excellent performance. Then you hit the last third and it all becomes more and more stupid until you have a killer with a lantern attached to your forehead, threatening to cast Sean Connery's wife (a typical and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and the baby very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator shaggy. <br /> <br /> A kind of movie that is probably best seen on a plane, even then only once.
