The film is, in principle, the story of a return of the Russian prostitute to her native village for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are also some other minor lines that might be more interesting than those taken, but are not fully explored. The heart of the film is burial, awakening, and later controversy over the future of a community of dollmen who buy dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but now the artist who has made them commercializable dolls is missing. Apparently, the movie is not edited. The prostitute's journey from town to village is a journey full of trembling and muddy trails. Perhaps we should impress with the immense Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and a man, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing doll business is problematic for all involved and, ultimately, seems impossible. Most of the movie is shot with a handheld that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western spectators is that subtitles do not include the songs and the crying of the crones. Do not go to this movie if you are not fluent in Russian.
