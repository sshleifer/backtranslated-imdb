I watched this movie when I was a young man full of violent hormones and it was a sexy movie, as I've ever seen - or ever see. Maybe it was not a great movie. I think it was not. I do not remember much about it, let me tell you the truth. I just remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in the movie ever made it to me, as she did incredibly sexy in this movie. I have not seen her since I got it on television in the 1970s and I do not think I'd want to see it again because I'm sure it would be a disappointment - my hormones are not as good and I have become more agitated over the years. Still, when I think about the shower scene again, I remember how great she felt back when she added later: After watching the movie again, I found it dangerous to go home again. What was once erotic is now pretty tainted. The work of the elderly and younger woman still works for me, just not as much as then, probably because they are not 12 years old. This older woman is younger than me. Also, the amateur of the whole thing has not been perceived by my 12-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better not to review the past.
