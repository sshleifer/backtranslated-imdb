To be sincerely honest ... I fell in love looking at the cut. That's why I gave it a 1/10 star because of the unthinkable storyline / filming / acting / everything I did. This movie was a RIOT to watch. If you like to watch bad movies for fun, you'll really get a shot at Severed. It really does not matter, it involves a guy who is bald and has a sword and is headed for decapitating random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural turn ... no one ever sees him doing it. <br /> <br /> Even when, in a very memorable scene, she enters a jampacked nightclub and shoots a girl's noodle and nobody sees it. <br /> <br /> Separate not just that it was filmed on the video-it was filmed on someone's home room. Those who made the film had knowledge of enlightenment (very thin knowledge) and composition, in fact, they are found together in some scenes. But especially you can not hear the actors ... you can not understand what they are doing and laugh when the next victim gets his pumpkin removed from his body. Go and rent this movie. Support films of this kind - they are a hoot and a hollar!
