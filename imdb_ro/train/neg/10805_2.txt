The only reason I was DVRd this movie was because: 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is playing basketball for us now and 2. I have always heard how terrible it was. The film did not disappoint. The best pieces were Shaq's costumes. The worst were, well, about anything else. My 12-year-old son and I was screaming and I could not look at the screen when Shaq started buzzing and we wondered why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But for all that terrible, we could not forget it, the story brought you like a black hole or a water stump or tar pitch, it was hypnotic. But it was worth to laugh and just to say that I actually pursued "Kazzam".
