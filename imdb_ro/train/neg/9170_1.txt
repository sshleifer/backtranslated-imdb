The question, when you see such a bad movie, is not necessarily "How was a movie made so bad?" or even, "Why did we see this terrible first?" but, "What have I learned from this experience?" Here's what I learned: Just because the "rules" of horror films have been cataloged and satirized countless times over the last ten years does not mean that someone will not go and make a movie that uses ALL without a humor of humor or irony . If your movie has to be described ** ** poorly based on the video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - The black character can not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - While you might be proud to have realized how to make the 'Matrix effect' on a budget, which does not necessarily mean you have to use it several times for grown ups. <br /> <br /> - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee roles of choice. <br /> <br /> - Whenever a scene does not edit together, use only a few pictures from the video game, no one will notice it. - If the rap-metal band of the cousin offers you to write the theme of the film free and polite decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not people killing zombies. It's about zombies killing people, preferably in the worst possible way. That's what makes them believe. - White people who can pay 1,600 dollars to get a rave, deserve to die. - If you find an old book, she'll tell you everything you need to know. Everything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, "What was that?" or "Where are we?" - The breasts are not panic of horror film. - A helicopter shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transform your film from "movie student" into "the big press studio." Try it! Just because you can give up all three of the three "Living Dead" films that do not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. I have seen worse movies, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
