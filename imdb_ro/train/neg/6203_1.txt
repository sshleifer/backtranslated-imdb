I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every boy's clich√©d, violent and rich fantasy was exposed, you just knew how it would end, especially with all the photos of the boss's wife and the rape of the first girl. The most serious part was questions and answers with the director / writer and writer / producer trying to meet as intellectuals, but you could say that these are the types that come down because of violence. I'm betting all the frequent brothels and doing drugs. Do not waste time. I had to keep my friend not to go out of it.
