this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious or just a satire. One of those movies that I use every stupid one I can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good in him in fact. But it was otherwise sucked. More than 10 years ago I saw it, but it still hurts and will not stop in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film really summarizes how stupid it is. I will not ruin it for you if you want to try fate watching this movie. But I guarantee you a nghya * moment at the end, with some of them. If you have nothing better to do and want to straighten and laugh then maybe you deserve it. In addition, if you're bound to meet someone you do not like, you might want to watch this movie together and probably leave you alone after seeing. This is a fair price to pay, I think.
