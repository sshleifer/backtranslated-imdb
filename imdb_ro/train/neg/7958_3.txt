Protégé runs linearly; do not expect fast action and you will not even feel breathing because there are simply no moments of sitting at the edge. There is not much trouble, so do not wait for one. I would not have been guilty of acting - the show would have been much worse if not for Wu's acting, which was the only salvation of the film. And also this cute little girl. Humor is the best, weak, and the show has to pass as a drug campaign that uses the usual shock tactics (esp in scenarios with Zhang) to tell us things we already know - for example, drugs disintegrate families, heroin crazy, it's not so easy to break up, you'll fall into a vicious cycle. I know it would look a bit rough, but I feel the show is far from trouble and quite unclear (* SPOILER ALERT *: Take, for example, when Andy Lau was brought to the police station: what do you have all the bands and proofs against you since 1997, "and that's how he was caught. No, no action tracking the car, just a leap of scene that undermined Wu's role as a covert first.) I suspect that the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is, in fact, a production of Mediacorp Raintree, a production company in Singapore.
