STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, had problems with alcohol and now forms a drug habit which makes him paranoid and prone to the domestic violence of his wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep her family together, but ends up going out more like a back. Meanwhile, her mother, Janet (Laila Morse), is conscious of Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that sends him off the rails. The movie follows these spirited characters as they shoot together with their lives. It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable and that would include watching movies that entertain them that way. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It is a story of a broken family, broken by crime, poverty, drink and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle defeated as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a story of self-destructive men, three separate generations, each copying the other, breaking a separate family, and women trying to keep it together despite the fact that they were not strong enough. If you lift a little offset, you can see that it does not promise to be a cheerful vision from the beginning and certainly does not disappoint it. it's true what everyone said about performances, and stars, Winstone and Burke, offer great action. We see Winstone losing to his wife, making sense of more coke-induced paranoia, stripping off during a phone conversation with her, and unleashing a typical arsenal of words and words when he refuses to let him see the child. Also, at a private time, we see Burke losing calmly on a scale, the full impact of the night before letting go inside. This is another of those films in which there is no "plot" to follow, as such, only a real life of these hopeless lives that take place from day to day. He was appreciated by many (including Baftas!), But he really was too hideous and disgusting to me. I have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what I know about it offset, but unfortunately I found it. **
