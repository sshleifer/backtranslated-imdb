Okay, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famed farmer and his wife's painting. Then discover this kid in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It would be a comedy. And I have to admit I was laughing ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: a mocking and abusive neighbor, a dull legal attempt, racism, speech about lying and death and arson. Hilar, huh? No, please, if you do not listen to anyone's reviews, do it here. You can not even force yourself to look at these crap. BULLSHIT! I said, CRAP! Anyone who puts their name there should sue.
