For the first seasons, I thought Apprentice was a very exciting and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week work interview was innovative, and the show's producers managed to hold the relevant show and not too "there". The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and has absolutely nothing to do with the business - not at all. In earlier seasons, they have put more emphasis on business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly on the boardroom where competitors are expected to do everything to keep them performing (it means lying, backstabbing, etc.). ). The boardroom can be fun to watch, but it's fun at its low point - Sometimes you wonder if you're watching a repeat of an old episode of Jerry Springer. The tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for companies that are bad enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the deal about half of the competitors who live in tents in season 6? It's stupid and has nothing to do with real-life business. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem to be idiots for me. In previous seasons, at least a few of the competitors had a bit of integrity, now it seems that competitors would kill their own mother to keep them in the show. Also, it seems that Donald Trump's massive self is getting bigger and bigger for every passing and honest season, I do not see why someone with a good sense would like to work for him. His rationality in the council room does not make any sense, and sometimes it seems he just wants to destroy people for what they deserve. R.I.P The Apprentice. Please, NBC, for the sake of God, take the show out in the air as soon as possible. It's too embarrassing to look. The apprentice once was a big TV show, but now it's just a big joke of fat.
