This small show is obviously a small little prequel / stupid from the original series. Compared to the live action series, this show is total stupidity. The live action show has smart jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a bitter, sweet version for younger viewers to digest, but I think kids can get away with this stupidity. The story in each episode is basically only Sabrina has a stupid and useless dilemma and she uses the magic to solve it. This is basically the idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina used the magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvesters to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre but exciting scene in which Gem says, "just love me for the moment," and Harvey gets down on her knees and knees and starts kissing her legs as she's a god. (which is fair enough because he is her mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort.
