This film deserves credit for its initial approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic stories. Unfortunately, it collapses on all levels. The biggest weaknesses of the film are: lack of engagement in anything; has elements of camp, moralistic and epic, without ever engaging in any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes revolves in his grave at this horrible adaptation, which makes Percival attractive, innocently innocent in a black and rude fog. Probably two types of people will see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the two, I found my film untouched and an incredibly shameless and disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
