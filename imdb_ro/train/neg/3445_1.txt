When young Kevin receives as a gift his uncle's uncle's boat, he invites five of his friends to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. During the trip, they drink drinks, have sex and play games, each of them saying the worst fear. Later, Kevin drowns off the sea, the engine stops and is haunted and killed by their greatest fear. Yesterday, his wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of running, the group gave up watching this boring and boring bitter and we decided to see another movie. Later, I decided to see the rest of this movie to see how bad it might be and it would have been better to sleep to sleep. The confused story has a terrible cinema and a camera work, with a cast that probably studies actors and actresses, and ultimately this movie seems to be a bad project of the cinema school. The terrible and demanding scenario finally shows a ridiculous turn, in fact a complete misery that made me not understand the story. The girl was mad and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with her imagined friends? If it is true, is their friend again at the end of the fruit of her madness? My vote is one. Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("The journey to death")
