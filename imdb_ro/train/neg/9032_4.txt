I never understood Garbo's call. She always finds herself in her films as if she were gathered, not all that appealing, and the annoying voice that could have drowned the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swanson, much better left in the silent era. In this latter film, her performance is very average and even unmistakable. Try hard, but it does not get anything, because the screenplay is even worse than her actor. I would be a romp screwball that is never credible and never descends (even if Melvyn Douglas manages to take the air in the ski scenes, which is really the only fun thing here). It was a potential, but the script fails in almost all departments, losing every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good chemistry, but this is not even a place on Ninotchka, which we also found highly overrated.
