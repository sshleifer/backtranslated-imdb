Of course, I watched this play with very low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a fairly unparalleled composer, whose lack of talent is overcome only by the size of his ego. This was the first cartoon movie I saw was 100% free humor. It is rude, offensive, redheaded and obviously anti-feminine. As such, it is a proper creation for Bohlen, but the average viewer will rather be stopped by it. No wonder he was never presented in a cinematic theater: he would have bombarded the BIG time! Not even the 6.5 MegaEuros spending has managed to save this piece of nonsense. Save time ... and money!
