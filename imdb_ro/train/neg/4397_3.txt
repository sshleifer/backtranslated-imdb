A friend of my sisters borrowed this game and it's too hard! It has the look of a game for kids, but you have to learn how to make thousands of complicated moves that require you to twist and turn your hands in all kinds of strange positions and you need to look for seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, "! You also have to find these hidden hidden puzzle pieces that require you to make almost impossible tasks to get them! AND THERE ARE ONLY THREE THOUSANDS !!!!! Perhaps if you do not have a life, you can stay home all the time if you could enjoy it, but otherwise you will keep it away! AND IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DEFINITION FOR CHILDREN - I WILL PRAISE HATE IN HOURS!
