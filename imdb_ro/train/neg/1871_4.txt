Despite the many productions and wonderful costumes, this film is a follow-up choir. Crime-mystery land is just a vehicle to fit musical numbers, but it often brings the process to a staggering stop, besides not being very involved. Although there was obviously a lot of money spent on them, the numbers are insufficient and poorly photographed. It's obviously a pre-code movie because girls often wear very little clothing and there's even a song singing praise of marijuana! Performances are all noteworthy, although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as a police lieutenant, looks for some clues for a while, maybe you want to throw the towel or at least quickly forward to the next number. It's a pity that the patrons who were caught in the cinema at her release, though!
