Oh God. I bought this movie and ... I followed ... the whole thing. . . Okay, it'll be fine ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. I soon hope to get back on the flash. I had to eat something after the movie, but I do not seem to be brave enough to try to keep some food at the moment. Bad? Yeah, yeah. Very bad. BAD Bad Bad. Wait, bad does not seem to receive the message in the right direction. Hmm ... There is no word describing how terrible ... not terrible ... Hmm disgusting horrible castrated / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do but to throw myself out. Eventually I burn it, I would not want to reach the base of an architectural excavation a thousand years ago. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
