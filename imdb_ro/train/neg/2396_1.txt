I just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a little surprised that it was even on. There were so many tricks, misery, and inappropriate editing that an old Sesame Street episode would have been better to look. The actress was fine, but please, you really feel the "Straight to Video" feeling. The cast / crew made this film a bad melody. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait up to ten minutes before you finish hearing it. Believe me, you would not even tell the difference.
