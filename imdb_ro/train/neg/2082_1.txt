What a waste of time and money! My hobbie and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and I thought it might be "funny." WRONG! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a badly written script and can not get out. The banknotes are weak and tired, and I do not even see how Wilson behind the gap can redeem any part of this film. The special effects ..... are not. Halfway I waited to see the harnesses and wires that held Uma in his flight scenes. And when the effects that people could not master jokes faster than flight speeds or struggle with scenes, they covered everything with a flickering swirling vortex - which concealed terrible effects pretty beautiful. Wilson's sidekick was a blade excuse for a man, and Wilson did not have chemistry with either Uma or his colleague. The sex scenes were not sexy, and funny scenes were not funny. I think I've been expecting too much from these actors. None of the characters was really sympathetic, so I did not care for any figure to fly. The only memorable shows were the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as adolescents - at least they had chemistry. On the whole, a super-stinko movie - I would not recommend it as a rental - would be a waste of money!
