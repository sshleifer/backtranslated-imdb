I think it was useless to produce a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good film, but it's ridiculous to make a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story ended after the first film. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story happen. It was meaningless!
