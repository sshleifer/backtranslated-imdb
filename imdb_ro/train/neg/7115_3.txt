Okay, so introducing it with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fear during the movie is so lame it's funny. So the first "scene of the skull" is so drawn that it is not suspensory, but fun. The real part of the movie is somewhat decent, there is at least a bit of authentic thought in character behavior, and the plot behavior is decent as horror movies go. The actor is medium, not bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not quite flat in the way a 1/10 movie would be. It is not terribly terrible to get the lowest rating or even the second lowest. If I just read the script, I would say there is potential for it to be a decent film. Just the horrible direction and the production that destroy the film. So it's a bad movie, but it's much worse there.
