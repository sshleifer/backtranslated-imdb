Every once in a while, you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can not stand and never have seen. This is the movie I'm thinking about ... days later. It has something to do with a piece of Shakespeare. I'm not sure, but I think I saved about 20 odd minutes in this movie ... I think I realized my tuna would not stick to themselves and look at me with an impression to be cut. > This movie seemed boring and pretentious for me. Even though this is the first movie I've scored so little (which I've actually tried to track), I would not want to get you another movie by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that her "chef, thief, wife, and lover" was a really great British movie, though his content was sometimes the stomach - a brilliant movie, but he can understand why people will refrain from seeing it . Another good movie from Greenaway was "A Zed and Two Nights." Again, it had content that pushed the limits of good taste, but it was intriguing though. The other movie I usually think too late for such radio shows is Brazil. I have never been able to look at it all the way without falling asleep! If you do not have the taste of self-important films that are extremely stylized, courageous and hard to follow without Prosero's book.
