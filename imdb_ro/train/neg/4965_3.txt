For such a big, classical (location) story, Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script, which did not have a dramatic tension. The story line of the club is useful and would offer a new interpretation of the literary class. For a strange reason, the rubric was abandoned early. Knowing he was shot in 21 days tells me "rushed" and unfortunately looks. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about FX, I can tolerate CGI really crappy, but the script has to rock and this was too slow, spartan and dramatic. It would blame the actors, but ... since I know I'm writing more than acting, I'll choose my colleague.
