The first who dies 2003 I first acknowledge my mistake: I did not realize it was made for the TV movie. I was "thrown" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes too long. Direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The bottom part of the movie is that it definitely falls into the genre of "flick fetish". Although there are violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or free sex scenes. In fact, there are no sexual scenes. She was Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests of the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to advance in their career as they were used as low actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, and as usual Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day, Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, did not get anything challenging to show her skill range. The biggest disappointment with the distribution was Tracy Pollan. Apart from being an average actress and not very attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I woke up moving the TV during the dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the type of Lifetime TV programs. I would not recommend paying money to watch this movie. Since we did not find anything that would censor, it's a movie worth watching just on television, because nothing will be cut. As a television movie, I would like that as 5 out of 10. As a feature film with an "R" certification, as well as a strong cast, I count it as 2 out of ten.
