Another emergency urgency from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson, a 13 inch Clint Eastwood space policeman, travels to Earth with a nasty head (!) Ugly and engaging in a South Bronx gang war! In short, but with boredom, with the gentler effects of the 50-year-old woman's attack. The man of continuity would have to shoot: Notice how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and every second blow. Unfortunately, this is why we see these movies, are not we? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic toys seem to be even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
