Over the past 10 years, we have worked in three different professional soccer fights, we have managed many professional fighters (including 2 star fighters), worked on 2 different fight programs, and made comments and comments for many fight DVDs. We have not witnessed the level of amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skills and poor quality of production in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. It is possible that this event is cataloged as a battle film of any kind is a misuse of the term. Recorded with low-cost video cams is basically home videos of kids playing back. Sound quality is bad, video quality is bad, and the act is terrible. "Fighters" wear improvised costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hook each other with a variety of objects and move halfway. Sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on a trampoline in the back yard. ALL are acting badly and executed with a lack of shame from any fighting skill. In short, do not bother with this stinker. No matter if your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (as in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
