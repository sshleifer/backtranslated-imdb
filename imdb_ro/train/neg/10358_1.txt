I read the whole book "High in Time" and then I saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but since the book was 190 pages, and the film was 2:00, felt really crowded with too many effects and bad acting. A river while it is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin should cooperate together to find the father of Meg and down the island camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really a stinker. Action is terrible, ridiculous and far direction is unnecessary situations. Even I was crushed to see Madeleine Engle same person who wrote the book and created the film, made a great book and a terrific film. The act is worse than any direct-to-video action. Yes, I have to admit there are cold effects. But seriously, all are terrible and do not show in any way possible. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the film. I would like to give it a 0, but unfortunately I can only give 1. Half could be useful.
