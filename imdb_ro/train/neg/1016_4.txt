The film itself is not too bad; many comments have highlighted the obvious flaws in the scenario, but are being followed. What it gives me, however, is that people like Justin Timberlake are even distributed for movies and, in addition, for films like this one. I have to admit that I have never heard the name of the man before watching this, but just the moment he appeared, I was simply annoyed. The voice is silly, the girl is a bad shot of Legolas, the posture is horrible and can not coordinate all three. He said I was delighted when he jumped after leaving the disco, because we had hoped that only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey would be from then on. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and these are the main reason they give this a 4. I see many future movies with little Timberlake cucumber ... and I can not believe it.
