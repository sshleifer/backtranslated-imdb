This is a real bomb. We must believe that Merle Oberon is the seized daughter of an ambitious politician who has to prove Tom DeLay in the 1930s that he deserves to be a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can not go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their crack and their support only by kindly Harry Harry Davenport. She joins the two little girls on an orbit and Gary Cooper is going to appear. Some rodeo shots might have been rooted in Misfits, but no luck with it. Gary later enters a formal dinner where Merle presides, and although she is invited to sit and join the group, she reads a lecture about their snobbies. Where did this sudden eloquence of cowboy come from? The most aggressive scene in the movie is a ghost party that Gary keeps in his unfinished house for his missing wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
