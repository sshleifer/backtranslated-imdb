I knew my summary would do it to you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco? Well, if you did not live in the '70s or' 80s, you probably can not understand why someone would like a new Coca-Cola or have a Pet Rock (and, frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I understand completely). There are only a few things that seemed to make sense at that time, but they really messed up the young generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (most of the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough influence that the studio played with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in the film. However, if you did not live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this kind of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his colleagues are incredibly unpleasant and their humor is very, very broad (that is, unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I was unable to support my antics and I do not think there were too many musical numbers in the film. Due to these factors, the great support film was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. The film involves Kyser and the band comes to a mansion where a young lady and her mad auntie lives. Once there, the bridge is washed and strange happenings begin. Finally, it culminates with a few attempts on Sally's life and a session. Everything is played for laughter - and it's not really a horror movie, despite the cast. Generally speaking, it is perceptible entertainment at best. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I felt I was wrong to look at Kyser and his traps.
