Pretty decent, with some stylish pictures, however, the small budget prevents things. I also have the impression that they have tried to shock you with some of the web materials of the weirdo perv chart. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in private stuff such as cyber city and AD police, then this could go in the street. But in essence, the low-budget array key is not totally devoid of its style. Good music by grunge / punk / post grunge bands. It's worth checking if it's just for the soundtrack.
