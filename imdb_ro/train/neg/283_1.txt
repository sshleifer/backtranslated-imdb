to the film, this movie felt like one of those who received school specials, only a smaller and smaller budget. I think this movie should have had some kind of inspiration, but it did not work for me. as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance, but so what? there is no enthusiasm in this movie. the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death. Of course, the whole movie feels like a cliché.the 80's bad act was less than a star, though it has much to do with what the actors gave (or in this case not) to work with. On top of they are poor choices of songs, with bad bad lyrics. all actors involved. They are all talented, but you can not say in this movie. This is my opinion, of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to believe a 1/10
