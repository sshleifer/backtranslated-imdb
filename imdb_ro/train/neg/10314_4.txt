Like someone who likes to see scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating story, I was optimistic in this film, but too many obstacles have come in the way of a good story she should have done. BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he's played, but his role here is boring as an insurance investigator. The dialogue is insipid and the beautiful Kathryn Harrold is a real mouthful of garbage. As far as I read, there have been some directors who have replaced this movie and that's too bad. You can say things are not right with the story. I could not get involved in Cooper's interpretation of Treat Williams, Cooper. It should have been fascinating, but it was not in this movie. It's also kind of a sad comment that a guy who commits a murder is a kind of "folk hero", but I admit that I have rooted the rooting for the guy too. Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the landscapes, from the lush and green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. I want to see that this movie has been re-made and done better, because it's a unique story.
