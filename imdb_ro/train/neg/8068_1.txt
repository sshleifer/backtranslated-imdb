I did not have huge expectations for this movie when I leased it for $ 1 to the video store, but the box showed at least one promise with the quake of "more sex!" I can not go wrong there! Well ... I do not have to say, the cottage is a fraud. How did the actors and actresses of this caliber score for such a low film? Everything opens with a drunken college girl who walks from a broken house or another building like this, useless shit to her boyfriend (?) As a room on a bad steadicam follows her. Then she is followed by a guy in a transparent plastic mask and grabbed by another. They cut their wrists for no real reason, and you can see when they "cut" someone who drew the pieces with what looks like a pencil. From there repeat the same theme of the girl who was foolishly tracked / killed by two guys for another 84 minutes. Adds one shot. They are survivors of the soul. I would not have had a problem with this movie if I had not stolen my tape to rent the movie. If I hired a bad movie that claims she has more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A full frontal blow in 85 minutes from a chicken that is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child do not cut it. If this is Killer Cut, what is the Theatrical Cut ?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually in the theater, first of all. Shame the actors in this movie. I saw them making their onscreen debut because they did not do anything before, but they were all stable before they were released. I do not know if it was shot before they were set up, and the studio stayed on the film until they were half-large or not. But what I want to know is ... that they have really spent $ 14 million on this movie!
