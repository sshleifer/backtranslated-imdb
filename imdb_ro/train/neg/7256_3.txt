I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised excellent images and music. I was also a great fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is very much Baraka style, wide angles, photos very similar to the cameras set to capture the passage of time in every shooting. Even some scenes were identical (street with traffic). While Baraka narrated a wonderful story, juxtaposing nature, human media, spirituality and the horrors of the world in an appealing manner and great music, this film jumped from shooting without shooting, mediocre music score and then. ... POOF, it's over! I thought it had to be a mistake! History of the world? Half of the film is Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I was not bothered to check it out). Serious people, it's horrible, rent it if you have to, but do not buy it. Film producers should be ashamed of giving up this.
