First, let's do a few things right here: a) I'm an anime fan - it's always been (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in preschoolers). b) I like more B movies because I'm hilarious. c) I like Godzilla movies - very much. Going forward, when the movie first lights up, it looks like it's your usual B movie, up to FX, but all the time - BOOM! the anime comes! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY down. Animation is very bad and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie that "I remember" alive is when a bunch of kids get out of school ... and they're the same kids over and over again! The FX is terrible; Dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, switching to live action on animation is not organized, the dialogue and the voices (especially the English dub that I have seen) was terrible and I asked my father to remove the box from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking jokes and comments like Robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to enjoy this film and survive at the same time. Heck, I'm going to show this to another fellow otaku my friend on Halloween for a B-Evening movie. Because it's bad, pretty painful to look at and unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I give this movie 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I will initially give. <br /> <br /> (According to my ranking scale: 3/10 means Pretty much so boring and bad, how fun as counting to three if you do not find a way to have fun with it, then it will become as fun as counting at 15.)
