Stephen J. Cannell seems to have decided a few years ago that he will widen his horizons and fall into horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground," is a piece of abyss. Now I noticed his name in association with the special movie I would have put back but no, I did not have my glasses and therefore I missed, I really have to bring them with me while the video shopping. The first question would be: Who the hell is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" movie, but again there are topless boys and some gore and some bad words shattered here and there. The main characters are so cute you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with some kind of farm tools. It seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast with a scarf, a witch that kills the children, who gathered the teeth of the children lived there. Probably something the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, nowadays, there is a ghost around a little girl who warns the real little girl who is now living there that something bad will happen. So there are two Bubbasi who were crouched on that property when the new owner took it, so they went to revenge. This has the feeling of a junk made for cable, which is for Halloween children, except, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so it's not only mediocre but also confusing. A great boo and rush to Anchor Bay to put this extra, given their regular recordings with fine launches, is a new low. Britain receives a Phantasm Box set, we get "The Fairy Tooth". It does not seem right. 1 out of 10, garbage absolutely.
