I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I overturned the channels and there was nothing to watch. It's one of those movies where you stop seeing what it is - just for a moment! - but after twenty minutes, you realize you can not stop it, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere between so bad is good and so bad is, okay, just stupid, it's worth seeing just experiencing the confusion of realizing that both! High mid night price, even for the fabulous tennis love. You do not even bother to wonder why nobody can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously masculine because logic does not apply.
