I looked at 3/4 of this movie and I wondered why he received such horrible comments here. It was easy to watch (at 3 am). He had a good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon in the sociopathic serial killer was very credible - it was both charming and refreshing. The rest of the main characters were not that bad. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple can not conceive, so go to a fertility clinic for help. A donor of sociopathic "genetic material" rests on recipients and, in the typical form of stalker, enters their lives. As I said, most of the movie was pretty good. We see that Conan grows increasingly obsessive in raising children and creating a perfect family with their mother. Of course, things do not work for him as he planned. It's not a bad plot line. But the last 15 minutes were horrible. I'm pretty tolerant of the movies (especially at 3am!) .. but, I was just amazed at how bad the end was written. In fact, I escaped from the outside! Everything, not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I could not stand by it anymore (if I did not jump over). The only rewarding quality here was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers ever. Try to look around the other channels before watching this .. But if nothing better is, give it a try .. =)
