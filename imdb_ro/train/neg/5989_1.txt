wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this movie at the cinema. You do not think I wasted my time. The actor is defeated at best, and the special effects are crude. The worst scenario in history is experiencing some extremely embarrassing quotations I've ever heard in my life. I swear to God "swept" is better than that. Madonna should also win Oscar in comparison to these guys. An hour and a half of my life I want back. Honestly, people do not see this, even the little kid would find this film an insult to their intelligence. I found this very strange movie in the fact that it was hard to tell you who is more of a wood, there are real puppets boys. party guys do not waste your time in the movie you're going to live to regret.
