Wow, here is finally; action "film" without action. In a real low-budget (do not miss the flying flying sails flying several times) of the future Seattle, we find a bad body that does not want to avenge its childhood. There is nothing even original or interesting from a distance about plotting and the performance of actors is just rigorously rivaled by attempts to steal from other movies, especially the "Matrix", without having the money to do it right. Yes, we see some running on the walls and hitting the slow speed (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cold as the body's attempts to make jokes about male incompetence from time to time. And, yes, we are also serving a number of leaderships that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the scenario was thought by the previous unseen distribution as you shoot the scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me it's as bad as it can be. In fact, it's not worth taking seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.
