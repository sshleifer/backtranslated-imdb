This is a late 80-year-old fest gore featuring some ugly mushrooms with a taste for human blood. If you can go through the ridicule of the whole thing, you can actually get a little joy. The actor is terrible, and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between gorilla attacks, but the movie is not a waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good and the gore is well done. He remembered Blob's remake, probably because of his weakness. Generally, with an hour and a half of your time, you can do worse, but I would not suggest to see the movie unless you have a strong stomach and you are in such a thing.
