A slick romance of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privileges. Ooh. Is that your appetite? Well, then, abdomen up to a VHS or DVD and a key on this free work through an unclear segment of history. To a great extent it is adapted from the famous Anne Rice book. Targeting is as overwhelming and melodramatic as the cheese-making dialogue. Most actors are amateur. The only note of production is that he has practically hired ten black actors, all those who were not employed on today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces barely seen at all (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It's also a sterling silver case for Nicole Lyn. James Earl Jones, pompous and weighted, is also on top. So, it's young Ossie Davis, a minimal talent that owes his success to being affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This movie should be rated "T" for clover.
