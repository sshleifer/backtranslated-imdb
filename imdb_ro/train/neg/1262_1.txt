This film has a weak plot, a poor characterization and really weak effects that ask me why I lost my valuable life by watching it. It has random characters that add nothing to the story and it seems to be an excuse for the director to make her girlfriend in the movie. Robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is powered by a big knife switch. If this movie was not so bad, it would be ridiculous, but it's nothing funny. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and is killed. It is sad when the roots for the bad guy, because he is the best to call. When everything is said and done, this movie was better left on the floor of the cutting room, or never funded at all.
