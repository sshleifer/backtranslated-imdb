Woody Allen made "September", proving that even a genius could do bad. This is "September" to Mel Brook. Monumentally stupid, boring and unhappy, I have to confess that I have not seen it all the way. Flick is among the most dishonored (for example, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea" or "Spitfire Grill"), who put me to sleep or forced me to get to the "rewind" button. And I say this unfortunately as a devoted fan Mel Brooks. He should stay on the right comedy and leave the social comment alone. As the same man who did "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could pull out a dog like this, it's beyond me. To be avoided at all costs.
