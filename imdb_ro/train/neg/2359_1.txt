This should have been the last Freddy movie (and it was over 10 years old) - you would think he would have tried to make a good movie. But it turned out that they offered us the most serious of the series (and that's a lot). The plot did not make sense (I do not remember seriously), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted death), and Freddy's fears were even worse than usual. The only good thing about this was a short (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first film "Nightmare" was his first film). I also saw it first in a theater, (which related Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well, the 3-D model was dirty - faded and the image came in and out of the fire. Also, the three flying skulls that should have been frightening (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. Whoever broke into laughter. It seems even worse on TV in 2-D. Useless and stupid - and very boring. Jump over and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
