The words "Swedish" and "action film" do not mix. This becomes more and more evident with every attempt made in gender. This is another failed attempt. Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works on a military air base with top-secret computerized systems. One day, foreign criminals are threatening to harm their family if they do not do what they say. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get this done. This film has ups and downs. And, in Swedish action films, there are usually no "ups", only "downs." So I think something in this movie has shown something of quality. To begin with the positive remarks, I can mention that the film is well-made from a technical point of view. Airplane images and flying helicopters are well shot and look good. The actor has a very different quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance, while Maria Bonnevie is rigid and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long Swedish directors will still use it, even if she has the skills of playing a wooden board?). Stefan Sauk is laughing as the "forced" man of special forces that comes to the ground to investigate. And what about the action scenes? Well, as I said above the scene of flying planes and helicopters are beautiful. But, besides, it's not too much to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish action films. Nothing is enough. Maybe it's a budget issue, maybe it's the movie culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Since honestly, the story and the acting are not good enough for this film to be based on that. I evaluate this 4/10 for the effort.
