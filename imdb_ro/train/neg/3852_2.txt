Was this one of the most boring movies I've ever seen? I do not know why? Just stories about the guy who is about to get married and begins to imagine someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all. I do not really know what was wrong with this movie. Most of the time when such actors / actresses come together to make a movie that has already been made a million times before is really fun. There is usually something a little clever in them, which is not really in another. For some reason, it does not attract your attention. You can choose some fun parts or smart ideas in it, but for some reason they are not even funny or smart in any way ?? I want to explain to him how he explains, but I do not? Just do not waste your time with this?
