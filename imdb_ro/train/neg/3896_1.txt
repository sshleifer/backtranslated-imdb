Good. Astronaut Steve West is in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you did not live until you saw the sun through the rings of Saturn", all the time when the sunlight in the middle of the day passes through the window when suddenly he has a nasal bleed. Then West returns home to a secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that makes a sharp nurse pass through a false glass door. It seems that the West "becomes stronger as it melts," which makes as many meanings as anything in this hopeless, subtle, moovie. Then, this "Lady Army Brass", which looks like Coleman Francis (the director of more evil) tries to cover the information, but the goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he melts. He attacks an old couple, for it melts. Makes a terrible actress cry and die powerless for about 10 minutes because it melts. It melts because it melts. FX by Rick Baker who is defending should be the star here, but they just show hokey. The film is poorly shot and everything looks so dark and tangled that it is very difficult to do what it is - not that anyone would help. MooCow says who cuts cheese with that? : = 8P ps - "Did not you get biscuits?"
