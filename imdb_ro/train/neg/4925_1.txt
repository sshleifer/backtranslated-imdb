Do not waste time. This movie rehashes the worst of Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Anne Rice Vampire Lestat (rock music and stupid biblical references) and blade (high-tech toys). I really like movies with vampires and novels, and there are many there that are very good. But not this stinker. Even the soundtrack does not help it, especially because the movie is based on classical, scary music, rather than metal-kick metal. Only a few times I heard some metal; most of the tortured violins. Avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.
