"How it moves" springs to life only when its members of high energy, talented casting kicking their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera. Otherwise, this long story of effort-suffering and success is low in energy, low in originality and low in anything that can make the film stand out from dozens of other similar films that came before it. <br /> <br /> Wesley's routine has a modest attraction as the young man in the academically talented city, who finds that the best way to raise his private tuition money is to enter dance enthusiasts, but both herself and her colleagues, writing screen and indeterminate direction. As I noticed earlier, the film makes a certain spark when performers are standing on the stage, but such moments are far too few and unfortunately transient.
