It's clear to see why Scary movie makers have found it so easy to say these teen slasher movies. They are so incredibly formal. And if Valentine had been released a year or so earlier, I'm sure he would have been spoofing this movie - if they found original materials to distinguish them from Screams, I know what you did in the last summer and Urban Legends. Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except for a better end than usual, which, of course, leaves much room for the inevitable continuation. As always, a masked psychotic killer crosses a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends one by one, usually in the top style. A lot of T & A on screen, no character development, bad action, and elaborate blood pressure too complicated. The thing I can not support for these movies is that they wake up like "who did it?" The problem is I'm not because the reason is revealed only after the killer has unleashed and tells the main character that friends have been killed now, usually something that has never been made clear during the movie (for example, the uncle's mother's uncle's main uncle's father hit his father's dog.) All those left alive throughout the movie are " suspects, "but they are" Red Herrings "rather than suspects, and as we all know at this point, the main character manages to escape and kill the psychic killer after the reason is revealed. of the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (a mini spoiler anyway) *************** In Valentine, the reason has not been revealed, but more, let you think that the movie does not juns quite concluding in "teen slash." The problem is solved only partially and the purpose of the lead killer may or may not have been met by surviving bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Does the killer want more, or have the demons really been defeated? This did not make Valentine a good movie, instead he simply saved it from the bad as usual, which still not for much. For anyone who is thinking about making another movie in this respect, please do not do this. Originality is so important that it is hard to see any originality that comes out of this genre.
