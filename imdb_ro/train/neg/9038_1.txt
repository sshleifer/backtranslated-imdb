This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not as the other reviewer put it, because it is "unfathomable", but rather because this version does not keep the spirit of the book. She tells the story, almost painful. Seeing it, I could turn the pages into my book and follow it, which is not so fun when it comes to an adaptation. Rather, you see Bartleby's 2001 version with Crispin Glover. This version, although humorous, brings new details to the film while preserving the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the details of things like setting, character names, and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, boring and hilarious. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if an adaptation is treated poorly, painfully, schizophrenic mind-minding.
