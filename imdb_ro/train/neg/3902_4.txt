This is really an adaptation of God to Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version of Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to be as close as possible to the book. But the act was terrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who think that Emma's real likeness was in the book, all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to do. He was often rude and offensive, he had no feeling, and throughout the movie you could not see his "growing" love for Emma. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to withdraw her leadership role as well as her partner. In addition, there was no chemistry between the cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem so torn that she was portrayed in the book. Movie settings are also too weak. The costumes are even more. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more elegant and elegant way he does here. The end is also too long. It's good that it resembles the end of the book, but it's a killer that ends up for a movie. And again, I do not see any sense of happiness before Mr. Knightley. In conclusion, I thought this adaptation was loyal to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed like the movie was done without any budget. I'd rather see the "lighter" version of Paltrow and Northam, even if it was clear that it was made a "blockbuster" than to watch these actors (except Olivia Williams and Better Kate Beckinsale) whole scripts .
