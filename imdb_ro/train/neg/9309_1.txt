Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this movie at all. The basic part is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip in his forest cabin for a weekend holiday away from work. After taking a girl on the road, things start to be wrong for all this. The story alone (written by the actor who plays Brandon, I think, though I may be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted accordingly. The "Clown Killer" is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious, but above all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a pile of weighing singers, on the one hand, which seems to be going through a middle secondary crisis. The only thing that justified writing this commentary was sexual scenes and any gore was in the movie (the quality of the movie made me get a joy from such things). In short, this film falls under any possible standard. Of course, I shared a few beers with a close friend, as we have been following this, so we've managed to overturn a certain amount of relative entertainment value in this movie and so it's fair to say that SICK just fell shy two ratings. However, in reality (and with retrospective benefit), star rating is a more than legitimate score for this movie. One in ten.
