"Dahmer" is an exciting movie, although I would not use "horror" or "thriller," I describe. It is more of a minor character study that seems strangely sympathetic to the killer. Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who has drugged, killed and dismembered male casualties. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney, well played by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost a more interesting character: in love with Dahmer and once he escapes, he returned to Dahmer for sex and survived a second attack. I think the movie is dissociated because it does little to describe Dahmer's trained years, as the events of the human monster that we see on the screen and does not give any insight into Dahmer's belief that they could create sexual zombies of his victims. roles are well played, but the story is thin.
