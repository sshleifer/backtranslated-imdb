They built it as a kind of fantasy. Snowy man meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance child and just for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe play with high-class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy elderly people. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are a lot of well documented facts that still leave room for artistic creativity to produce a good historical drama. It's not Robin Hood's story, not Arthur's legends, not Beowulf, and not someone whose life is so wrapped in the mists of many centuries ago that any recreation of life and time is a 99% assumption. There are only a few lives behind. My grandparents were already in school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's silly because I imagined that this movie was a serious attempt to tell Kelly's story. After reading Peter Carrie's excellent novel, "The True History of the Kelly Gang," we were looking forward to this. But no, it is that Kelly in 1970, much disturbed by Mick Jagger, was probably much closer to reality and a better film as a whole, which does not mean a whole. two dollars to hire the DVD! I'll give him 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful photos of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
