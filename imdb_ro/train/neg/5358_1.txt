It's obvious that all the good reviews posted for this movie are from insiders who were either involved in the movie, or those who know someone who knows someone and who has seen multiple cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I saw the final cut, and it's just garbage. The only thing he has for him is the ambition and several horrors of horror legends (none on display for terribly long). It is as if the filmmakers made this film on a weekend during a horror convention and had actors such as Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to shoot scenes during coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap movie, shot on video Wannabe X-Files with terrible action from a cast of non-actors with more bitching than is acceptable in the 21st century. Act little or no; it is a highly explicative dialogue that tries to explain a complicated plot. The FX computer is a joke, but it is not enough and not enough action to make this movie pleasant in an MST3K mode. After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talk, you will find that you touch the button fast forward ... and do not let go. Absolutely worthless.
