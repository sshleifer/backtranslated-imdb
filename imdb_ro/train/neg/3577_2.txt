This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar formula of Harold Robbins: the ambitious walls of the main decadent character, while pursuing the path to the tip of a randomly chosen but charming world, in this case the cinema industry. But in spite of the fact that it is so formic that it is completely predictable, this film succeeds at the same time as being completely unbelievable. Zadora (telling her that she has no experience as an actress is a charity) never convinces as a screenwriter. We could expect a film about movies to have some insights into our own industry and creative process. But the script does not give him any of the qualities that make writers interesting film characters: respect, word of mouth, a love-hate relationship with their own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence here. The cinema is so troubled that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. And the scenes never hang together, so everything seems to be a succession of random Hollywood parties. Avoid.
