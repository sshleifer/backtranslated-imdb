This version moved a bit slow for my taste and I think I have problems with this game for the start. But first, the movie is a typical version of a television, which means it does not have the flair of the original version of William Holden. What could not afford to hire more than twelve people as an extract? Why move the movie to 1966? So could you give the little sister a line about Vietnam's war protests? Why not 1963 and give him a line on the civil rights movement? As for casting, some hit a few misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with Josh Brolin's scenes. Brolin, on the other hand, misses many notes. He is credible like an ex-BMOC jock but does not have the bold sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked like a gorilla like all the women in town to go over him (forgive him). Gretchen Moll was great, but he seemed a little too wise for the character he played. It did not design innocence or ignorance of the necessary character. Maybe because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But Holden was still ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgetful because Mom and Mary Steenburgen do not seem to have thought about playing Blanche duBois or Katharine in The Taming of the Shrew. As for Mr. Inge, I always felt that stories such as a young woman who chose passion for practice always needed an epilogue. "Twilight Zone" is believed to offer a likely epilogue to the "Spur of the Moment" episode in which a young Diana Hyland was watched by a bitter Diana Hyland, because young girl Diana Hyland chose to run with a Hal-like guy Carter.
