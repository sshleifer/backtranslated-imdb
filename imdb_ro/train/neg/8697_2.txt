Carnosaur 3: Primary Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why are you even bothering to review this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which the prominent military guys discover those prehistoric, dead (and very fake) monsters running around in the humble way of killing people. The original was pretty bad, the sequel was even worse. This falls somewhere between them, although it is not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR movies. EVALUATION: 2 out of 10. R rated for graphic violence and gore, terrible images and profanity.
