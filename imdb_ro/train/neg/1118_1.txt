I was even terrified of this wonderful movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Very promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you start to really sweat and feel uncomfortable, because you start to worry about the worst thing. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare and what's worse - it all comes out. For an hour and a half, I tried to fight with complete boredom and sleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrible image - for your eyes, for your ears, for your intelligence and especially for your wallet, because the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this amateur cheap homevideo is the greatest horror of all.
