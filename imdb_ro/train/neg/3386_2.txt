Yeah, I was lucky enough to see Michael Bennett's original long-lasting musical performance. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit the theaters in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everything is failing. First of all, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right material) is a bad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to allocate ANNIE. The room is always in a wrong place - they cut the songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the song was these dancers - these hungry and talented artists just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they had the chance - you could not take their eyes off of them. But this distribution is only through dance, it has a "nice" job singing, but none of them sparks a little. Actually, look at the distribution on IMDb - none of them really went to do anything. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So, this cinema train does not capture for one second the magic, the despair, the musical passion of the scene. A total blow! (But even if it tries to endure the music - the awesome music rises sometimes and reminds the people how great the score is).
