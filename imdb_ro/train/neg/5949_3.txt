It's not a common thing to see American re-branding of foreign movies that collapse on the face, but here's the part of the flip! This is a re-awakening of the British movie "Wide Awake" by the British! "Wide Awake" is funny but fun and funny! "Liam," on the other hand, is just weird. I have to give credit for "Liam" for one thing and that makes it clear that I made the right choice to change my religion!
