Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page's life, to go along with her own problems with men. As is typical in all of her work, each major male character is portrayed as weak, frightening or twisted. To add to her fiction, she designs ideas and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not leave her biz because she thought she was morally wrong or had religious problems (though she later became alive later in life through the influence of her third husband-minister). She left her, because she was 30 years old, her acting career did not go anywhere, and she felt she was losing sight. Suggestions of molestation and rape are invalidated and denied in Bettie's words and are the director's attempts to argue that any woman who did what Bettie did has to be victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie has designed his own clothes in almost all of his varieties (not given to him by the "sick" fetishers). Harrow also fails to make an idea that Bunny Yeager, who has made many famous photos of Bettie, has also made numerous "cheek" movies with Bettie and was not the professional moral photographer portrayed in the film. The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks a lot like Bettie. Otherwise, there are more accurate and honest movies and documentaries to her life and the people in her.
