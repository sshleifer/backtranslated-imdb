A group of people are invited to the high school meeting, but after they find it is a scam by an old colleague, they have played an almost fatal joke. Now he is looking to take revenge on all those who hurt him by closing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines. Dark film with an unusual premise. Put it in a note are some good performances, some pretty deadly scenes of death, a lot of emotions and scary, a humor and an original end. Not valued for extreme violence, graphic nudity, sexual situations, profanity and drug use.
