Ripping this movie apart is like dragging fish into a barrel. It's too easy. So I will challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of the little man. First, I'm impressed by the special effects. He even showed that Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a small person. I never doubted for a minute. Secondly, I liked some unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier sang an annoying restaurant singer, and the performances of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' Up Up" were invaluable. John Witherspoon, who coincidentally starred Grier's father in Boomerang since 1992 (if you remember, "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. Beyond that, this movie is as credible as White Chicks. How stupid is it when the doctor can not say that he is a 40-year-old man and not a child? Has a complete set of teeth! How is it possible that no one notices that she is not a child? The little man is so bad that there is a chord Rob Schneider. And please, if you're stupid enough to lose $ 8 on this movie, just do me a favor and DO NOT bring your kids. This movie is too sexual for young children (many jokes and suggestions about sex, falling down, eating, etc.) and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their children to the screening I was forced to to support him. If you insist on seeing an idiotic movie, at least redeem the pain and suffering to the children.
