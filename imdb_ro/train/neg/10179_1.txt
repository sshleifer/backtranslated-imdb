This film is a shame for the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I really can not believe they have escaped Cleveland. (Yes, I realize that at that time the real Indians were pretty good, and the twins took their place at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway, I liked the First Major League, liked the second, and always looks forward to the third, when the Indians will finally go to the series. You can not tell me it was not the plan after the end of the second film. What happened? However, if your true true Legends fans do your favor and do not look at this junk.
