In a dormitory a guy is killed by someone with a pin. Beth's girlfriend (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later, he came out with a new friend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend his spring break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a beautiful, beautiful Florida apartment. Of course, the killer appears (for no reason) and starts killing again. Slasher Lousy's Thriller - An example of a manuscript on how not to make a low-budget horror movie. For starters, the big part of this movie is ENDLESS filling these six idiots who are filming alone, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), elders, silly actions etc. There is also no nudity here. I'm not saying that a horror film requires nudity, but NEVER, to live this would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), they are just a little bloody and there is no gore. There is a terrible person REAL - but that's not the end. With a few exceptions, the act is shit. Dorie Barton is terrifying that the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is stupid as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and it's TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good - beautiful and charming and giving him all the shit. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role to do a pretty good job. The logic loses in abundance - once they realize that a friend has been killed, two of the girls occasionally talk about sex; Baston's reaction to not seeing a friend who was killed is kind of funny and what's going on with Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Dull, stupid, without gore, no nudity - skip this.
