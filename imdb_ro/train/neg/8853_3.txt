In the first Howling, we are presented in a world where there are werewolves and are somewhat organized. The movie in that movie made sense; a TV reporter is investigating this and trying to discover the truth. It ends by killing many of them, including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then she shows the world that they exist by transforming them into live television. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first film and do not improve in this movie. Whether it's transformation or a bad puppet, or computer graphics showing superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not that bad; they must kill the werewolves leader for some reason. This will not destroy all the werewolves and really does not end the threat of the werewolves because ... they just want to kill her. I think there was some turmoil for that, but it's really lost in the movie. After the movie ends, we have a 10-minute montage of the movie we just watched, and every other scene is where the female werewolf leader descends from the top, exposing her big tits, while The band at Devo-esquire plays with a lot of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this film to be watched is Christopher Lee.
