I have read some comments about this movie and I can only assume that some people are easy to enjoy. This movie is nothing. It is so severely written, guided and acted that it barely makes an impression. The characters talk in a cliche dialogue and the situations are completely implausible. While this could make this campy and fun, not because everything is so lifeless The movie becomes boring. It's like Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman who is struggling with her sexuality, but then it was not allowed either by studio executives to tell the story of a real taste or had cojoons. This movie could go to encyclopedia as the standard movie for Lifetime.
