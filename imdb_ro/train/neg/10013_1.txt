A used plot of a rapper for a woman in a murder case + the equally used land of an outsider from the inside who is finally closed. , it is believed that the film will rise above its strange origins. But the stage scene decreases without changing the intensity, character arc, and inexplicable behavior. The theme of homosexuality was completely useless - or, on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seems to be included only to prevent viewers. When will Hollywood find that homosexual characters do not automatically make a more convincing picture? A terrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I was expecting her and Kristin Scott Thomas better. This is definitely a desirable one.
