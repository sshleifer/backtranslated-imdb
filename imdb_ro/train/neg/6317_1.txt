I have no idea what they did from San Francisco in this stupid plot, but it seems that they have to get down what drugs they take and put their analyst on distress money - now. this is a plausible story if you consider the alien abduction sequence in "Brian's Life" to be plausible. This film is little more than a stream of left-handed stream. If the US and the USSR would give up nuclear weapons, the result would be to remove the only real obstacle that prevented the two from engaging in a war. Evil as Korea, Vietnam, and other wars of the time were "proxy wars" that fought to keep superpowers from direct involvement. This film makes me think how realistic it was when a group of high school children would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone would say "Mr. President, some children from Drastic High do not eat!" and Ronald Reagan would say, "God, I better review my defense policy!" Correct. Like this movie? It would not be better if the Soviet Union had collapsed because it could not support the construction of massive weapons ... wait, that's what happened!
