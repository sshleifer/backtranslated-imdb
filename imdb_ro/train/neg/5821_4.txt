As others have said, this movie should have been a great Hammer-style movie and it seems to me that so most of the actors have been trained to play it ... but the script is so lead, a lot of boring soliloquies the poor Timothy Dalton is buried with most of them) that he is too exaggerated and self-important. This is a poor interpretation of Dalton, although he silently cloaks the climatic scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only good-looking actor is Patrick Stewart, which is a very welcome sight. Freddie Francis could have been a great cinematographer, but he was a bad director.
