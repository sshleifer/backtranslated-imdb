A clumsy, thriller thriller has a young couple researching the most infamous American crime scene, becoming a partner with a young woman and a black friend - who is a real psycho. Arty and alienation, the tone of the film alternates between pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance. Probably made by hand, but ridiculous. Brad Pitt's performance, as a low-rent killer, is vain. * from ****
