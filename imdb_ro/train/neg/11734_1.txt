Tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It was not supposed to be funny. Matt Farnsworth does not know what he's doing. His story is written, apparently, without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the Meth problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his movie even more boring for me. Why do they have two main accents? Makes no sense. The act was mediocre at best and sometimes hard to follow. Graceful violence and sex filled the movie. I think violence and sex were supposed to make the movie nervous, but it turned out to be unbelievable and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliant that all I could do was laugh and look at the credits spread out with mistrust. When I left the theater, everyone else was laughing with me. The end of the movie was meant to evoke tears, but it did the opposite. Do not waste your time with this terrible movie if you do not want to see ignorant, satirical, outdated, climbing stragglers.
