A ruthless attempt and a painful attempt not to transpose Sheriff Bart's character from Mel Brooks's clogged villages into his own weekly sitcom is just as bad as some say he is! just serves to remind unamuz viewer what all in this supposed comedy is destined to be a joke and how desperate to laugh it really is it! However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying best to get involved on Cleavon Little. Jena's shows in every scene. He was much more fun in HBO El Diablo than he was here in this cheese plaque! Really the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is his horse's name!
