In spite of a pleasure plot and expensive production, he wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese closet and the cultural consultants? Not on apparent salary. A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she was looking at before her eyes. In a later conversation, she said, "Imagine that a Finnish director made a movie in Fnnish about American civil war using Swedish blond actors like the union and French army as confederates." She loosed herself and played a hairdresser in her years 1950. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the pocket skirt "was missing the circle" or admired Jane Mansfield's bizarre hair, but in Atlanta she would not have thought of her eyes or ears ... and to laugh in the corridors ... a great story and a photo to be cursed so ... watching the memoirs of a Geisha have been painful for anyone who knows the Japanese cultural nuances, geisha or the Japanese dress, and which was the subject of the movie Hollywood is amazing in his myopic vision of the film, which most often gets big money, while leaving the details that really polish a refining of the movies in an embarrassingly wrong way. How bad could be another good film about Japan. The memoirs of a geisha are better and worse at the same time.
