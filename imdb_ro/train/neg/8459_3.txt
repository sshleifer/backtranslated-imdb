Some very interesting room works and a story with great potential. But he never meets anything more than the graduation thesis of a student in the film school. There are two main reasons for this. Punch, there is no single good character, not even a villain we can admire for chutzpah. Second, all the acting is terrible - even from veteran Willem Dafoe. The ham is so rich here, you feel like being at a picnic, but one of the picnic of those miserable employees of the company who drinks too much cheap beer and you get a hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat a hot and throw up. Okay, I'm a bit tough on a young director who could still go - as I said, the room work is pretty good. But I feel cheated - the blur for this film suggests that we are going to watch a "Modern Western" film, and DVD packaging has images that suggest this - but in fact no one has anything to do with the movie seems to know it's the kind of the film he should be doing. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is confused with hope and, as a last resort, we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about midway. but the rental shop will not give my money back. Now, that really hurts.
