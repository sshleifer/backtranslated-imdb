VILA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a great disappointment! And even if Sam Peckinpah had a scenario maneuver, along with Robert Towne, it all comes as a full-length movie directed by Buzz Kulik, undefined. First, top Yul Brynner, like Pancho Villa, is wrong for that part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His only performance note is lacking fire and the taste of Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought the role. Brynner simply looked like a Russian aristocrat dressed as a Mexican bandit who is in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, the second taxed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! Its part as a biplan flying the ace lobbing home bombs made of air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written writing role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the whole movie, and brings to mind his image of another Mexican revolution, superior to "Bandido" (1956), which, unfortunately, no one seems to have any interest in DVD release. Besides the lack of style, "Villa Rides" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the happy eye, but her pouring is just superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have added a pair of notches that should have risen to the story line. There are some good action scenes in the film, but some good action scenes are not a movie, and Panavision's picture quality less than perfect, plus the non-repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune does not help. Like Paramount, there is no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing film and a DVD presentation that could have been and should have been much better.
