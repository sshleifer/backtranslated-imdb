This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in her days. An upper-class Anglo-American woman sketches, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to engage in secret activities of an antisense type. There is an intelligent change in the role of sex because its activities prove it more daring and daring than most of the male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and beautiful stranger to keep up with love, and this wicked lady does not come back to meet before he meets the right man. The weakness and gullibility of each other makes the plot not convincing in the extreme, but those who are thirsty for romance will overlook it.
