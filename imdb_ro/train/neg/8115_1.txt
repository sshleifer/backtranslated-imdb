This movie was the most horrible movie to watch the experience I've ever had to support, and the worst thing is that I had to watch and did not have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Of course, the story was decent ... but I found the terrible act! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was great. She was the only highlight, without her, I doubt that I could stand watching the movie. Every time I hear someone saying "daarling" I cringe! I attacked almost a client of another day, because they said "she". It makes me remember one of the worst hours and half of my life! (I apologize if this offended anybody, I only express my opinion)
