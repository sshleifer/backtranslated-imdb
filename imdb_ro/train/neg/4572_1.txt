This film extrapolates quantum mechanics frequently to justify absurd ideas, covered by such statements as "we all create our own reality." Sorry, people, reality is what is true to all of us, not just credulous. The idea that "anything is possible" does not maintain the water for a closer examination: if possible, the opposite is so possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to a postmodern nonsense, which is nothing more than an attempt to denigrate the established truths, so that all well-founded and stupid ideas are equal. To quote SF writer Philip K. Dick, who said so well: "Reality is what, when you no longer believe in it, does not disappear."
