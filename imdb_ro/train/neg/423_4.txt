I do not know why, but after all the hype on NPR I thought it was a new movie ..... all the best pictures were used for the BBC projects and NatGeo projects that you saw if you are interested the natural programs ... was repackaged with a sappy narrative and too dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day - there are wonderful moments and it's always nice to listen to Darth Vader ....... oops, James Earl Jones was talking, but I was hoping to make a stone film, considering the new camera technology used to make this movie ...... was disinfected for an audience baby, so you can better see better movies on youtube .... feel that we are due for something like a breaking earth like Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not
