I do not know who Sue Kramer is, the director of this film, but I have a strong suspicion that A) is a lesbian and that to some extent has deceived all those involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic. <br /> <br /> I think everyone thinks, 'Lord, this is horrible, not funny, pedestrian, but keeping mouths closed for fear of being labeled as anti-homosexual or not taking the style (This is probably why Kramer did NOT throw homosexuals to play and homosexuals.) However, it is not worth reviewing .Actors are advised to play each scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or credibility in what they do. and there is nothing about this movie that is a bit funny - much less funny. "She hated me and I'm not afraid to say that." It's a pity that lifeless people who gave Kramer money to do this bombs were not as impartial in court.
