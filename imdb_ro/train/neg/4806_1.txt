I do not know what these Brady kids are. First, Barry Williams doubts she's sexy with her television sister, Maureen McCormick, then about meeting with TV mother Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a bunch of porn movies. Then, Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble for driving under the influence of alcohol. Eventually, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a small blow of the same sex on one side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful and young model in the early 1920s during his "The Surreal Life" party, which was fun to watch at first and is now married and in a very volatile relationship and hostile. The last episode, where she put up a bunch of nude shots with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part. And she took care of her in a very mature way, just by taking her and letting her clean her head. I think he always bends to every need and now he finally gets up. And I do not like to say that, but I think he's abusing it verbally. The way he tortured him for an engagement ring and the way he remembers him for every little thing. She also speaks openly about being flown with other women, and it is obvious that she still sleeps around him with women and men, which should not make any human being respect his loneliness when is already married to someone. If it were a man who talked so much with his wife, and go out every night while having sex with other people, everyone was behind his wife to leave her. Why it should be different. What started out like a pretty little love on another reality show flourished in a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who need a therapy because she laments like a kid over so many stupid things. I'm sorry for her, but Chris has to get rid of her because he's a good man who can not afford to be humiliated like this one.
