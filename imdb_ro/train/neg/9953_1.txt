I really have to see a good movie soon, because it looks like any other entry or something like that is something I despise. However, I speak my history, I do not have to say a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about him sucks big shell of green bananas. I never thought I'd see a frightening movie like this. Al Pacino does not act in this movie: it presents him. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a racing car driver, just looking at the camera. It's absolutely terrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two should be in a love affair and there is simply no chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no genius behind Tootsie here. Is that the same man I annoyed in Eyes Wide Shut? I can not believe. Save your horrible movie experience. Run, do not walk away from Bobby Deerfield.
