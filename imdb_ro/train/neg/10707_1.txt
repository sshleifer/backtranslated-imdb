Where to start? Probably this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was hit. Most of the movie he could do here is the effects of the blow, with the muffle in the background. I had to turn my full explosive volume only to what had happened ... and what was I supposed to hear accurately? Probably one of the most serious scripts ever made. I can not believe people put something green for this movie. It makes me think I could take a fool into a box, send it to the producers and get them to fund me a movie for me. Dolph was an ordinary Dolph. Nothing else has to be said. The villains were evil, the protagonists were bad, and the film was dirty. If you really want to know what you MUST NOT do when writing, editing or editing a movie, look at it!
