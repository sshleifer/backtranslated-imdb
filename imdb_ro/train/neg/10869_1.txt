A friend of mine borrowed me this movie and I was pretty excited to look at him but after ten minutes of James Hetfield's vocals slow and Lars tapping his drum in what seemed to be slow I began to think: Do I look at this? This question will be coursing through your minds in 5? 10 minutes after you hit Play. I gave her the box back the same day, as you thought it was not worth buying or watching! Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
