Had I not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never have guessed that this pretty and old-fashioned music was made by a man so closely associated with the new French wave. In fact, the movie is so far from that, that I wonder if in the 1950s and 1960s, New Wave auteurs would have hated this type of movie - it's so ... unreal. And, it seems does not have much to do with so many of its previous movies. This is not necessarily a bad thing - a very surprising thing. What seemed to me a bit surprising was the amount of praise some commentators have given to this film - especially when there are so many French musicians there better. The songs in this movie were not at all interesting and the characters seemed so gentle and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who worried about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer suit, I was going to eat. The bottom line is that, musical, not every French music is gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (CHERBOURG UMBRELLAS or "Huit FEMMES") and, despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I do not see much reason to recommend anything but strange oddity.
