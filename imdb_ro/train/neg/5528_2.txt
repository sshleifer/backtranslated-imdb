With this movie running only 61 minutes and nothing good on TV, I've decided to listen to the Zombie Revolt in DVD for time. Even if I realized the era to come, I was very disappointed. It started with the incredibly optimistic quality of the opening score (what - without music) and then with the slow opening sequences. God, I thought about a movie about zombies - even in the 1930s - would have had plenty of chills (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, he certainly did), but that had nothing. Zero. It was not even dramatic (except for the few moments with the naked eyes superimposed over the film to indicate the mesmerization of a person). Like the equally boring zombie king, this movie might be an interesting curiosity to have, but nothing more.
