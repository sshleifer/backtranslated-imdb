Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was how he communicated with his audience. His small banknotes, foolish songs, and frightening dances came down well because he managed to hire people and draw them into the world on the wall. The lack of a living audience was a distinct disadvantage for him and he was never comfortable in the movies. He has moments in "The Ghost Train," and his character, Tommy Gander, has been adapted to harness his talents, but Askey, the performer, has to be considered appreciated. the film is not strong, includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a honeymoon couple; Linden Travers crosses the top as a "crazy woman." Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who married out of the screen, Phyllis Calvert, as a leading man, giving a gentle reading to the play and leading Mrs. Carol Lynne, which turns into a performance just as tasteless. Kathleen Harrison's actress is left to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot-lover of a single woman who gets destroyed on Dr. Morland Graham's cognac.
