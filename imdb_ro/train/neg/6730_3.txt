This is a movie about how men think women think of love. No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares her a love story. Of the ten monologues I felt, only three really had a certainty through them. I waited for the movie to get better and it was done a little, but never better. This is an interesting concept and I wanted to be fine, but never succeeded. Perhaps, if it were actually love stories, it would have worked.
