Do not be fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified. Their scenes were probably filmed in a day or so. Whatever their reasons for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you'll use it better. For me this is a sign of bad direction through and through. The plot itself was not that bad. And the action from most actors was above average. But Cuba Gooding Jr. was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this movie was considered a serious film that can not be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but they did not have that particular fist to make them more interesting. Again, a better direction was needed. Also, the rhythm was wrong for a movie like this. It took almost half an hour to get into action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes, which is far too slow. The only factor of redemption is Angie Harmon. She does her best to do everything. Too bad the director left him hanging. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to get him out. And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber, you would expect at least some interesting action scenes. Do not waste time with this. Avoid!
