From the beginning, this film had some flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is the rich young mogul who has inherited the richness and strength of his father and strives both to fill his father's shoes and cut the strings of his mother's apron (and co-executive) too tight. He also has the problem of having a cardiac condition and waiting in the limbo, which is the organ donor registry. There are also minor stories that your first instinct is most often ignored, which becomes important later, such as friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his love with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Lines of untrustworthy stories, but not bad enough to destroy the movie. The only true "oy vey!" the moment was the name of Lena Olin. Arrogant woman named Lilith ... subtle! Surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that people who find scary surgical scenes might not. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was good at the beginning. You will follow in emotional agony as Christensen screams inward through chest incision and rib cage. The moment of irony in the trailer comes when, while he is one of the few bad luck who had to be awake during anesthesia, he is also lucky to help them find out that his surgical team is planning to kill her. /> The big twist, however, is highly predictable and sends the bloody film in the conspiracy and its memories of the small signs that were there, but he, like us, missed the original. <br /> <br /> There are two more incidents involving his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture of Olin, which is not so impressive due to the poor writing. The other is a secret about the family past, which seemed very dizzy and useless. The initially well-made anesthesia theater becomes lost in badly written conspiracy drama. There is an ultimate attempt to bring it back, which collapses, taking the whole film with him.
