We stopped viewing this episode because I thought the deaths of Ana-Lucia and Libby were useless and very depressing. Then I found out that they kept Libby dead in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. I liked this show for the first season, but certainly fell in the second season, I discovered that the minor faces of Jack and Locke are annoying. The death of Rodriguez & Watros's characters was the final straw! <br /> <br /> I gave this episode a 4/10, because it was the end of my viewing of this great series was created by legend Alias ​​J.J. Abrams. I hope its series will improve in the future.
