Sometimes I can not understand what directors think when making a movie ... I've had a trauma after watching Careers (2007) and I thought they would not do it again. But after a lot of stunning promotions, Tashan eventually ended up as a heart attack. Such 3 amazing songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, a predictable plot, a lot of Akshay Kumar waterfalls and nothing interesting except to watch Kareena after her major loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music-another major disaster ... in the music album, they spent time putting on the small pitiful dialogues of these 4 jokers and did not think about giving the background song when Akshay Kumar do the stunts ...! this song is so beautiful, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you are going to watch this movie, I would say, watch it to listen to that background song that goes like this ... "Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ..." Generally, very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji made the attempt to speak English bad! Go away man, I need puff!
