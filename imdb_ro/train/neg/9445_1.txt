Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you're doing! <br /> <br /> I was terrified. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take copies to watch this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they will be bored and disappointed. Of course, we all read the wonderful book of Theo's children, and we certainly have expectations ... but this is pure garbage. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never have given her "big fingers" to such an attempt to take advantage of a classic. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Spend the money in your book. If you have a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie does not deserve a free view of the tickets. <br /> <br /> Stick with the book. The cartoon version for television works well if you want a visual portrait - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on Saint Patty's birthday. <br /> <br /> Shame Shame Shame on What I Do!
