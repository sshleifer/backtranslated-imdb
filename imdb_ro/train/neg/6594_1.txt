I've seen the most, if not all classic Laurel & Hardy movies. I always enjoyed it there, comically bad, even after I looked at it again and again. This new film tries to bring back the classic with two new actors that resemble both Laurel and Hardy, but fails to do anything for various reasons. One of them is the way their fabrics are not found (even the beginning of the 20th century), but both are portrayed in the 90's. Some of the former dialogue has been brought back, but it also fails to approach miserably of the classic series. This movie may well be the worst movie I've ever seen and should be pulled from the shelf and locked forever. True Laurel & Hardy revolves in their graves in such a bad imitation.
