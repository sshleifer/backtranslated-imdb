The 3-D model presented in "The Man Who Was Not There" is DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept play has 3-D damaging effects that make the 3-D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th Part 3" look better by comparison. Not to mention that the movie is asinin to the extreme. It was one of the many 1983 films featuring pop-off-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were caught in this mess, but at least they did not kill their career. Tambor will attend HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard boxing "How Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon." What they in those projects, in their place, in "The Man Who Was Not There". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
