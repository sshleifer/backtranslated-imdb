This is one of the most serious adaptations of a musical ever made. The stage version of Chorus A is wonderful. This film loses its mark in almost any way. Even casting is tangled. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but a section 3 in the art department. Yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she is a great dancer. What do brilliant directors do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous because it looks great. How to lose the boat. Then is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett is back in the grave. Why did not they use choreography? Can not really improve.
