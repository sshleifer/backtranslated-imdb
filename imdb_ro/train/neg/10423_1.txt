so ... it's really sexist and classic and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, like when the stella says she wants to really change and start talking correctly and says not to change. well, he changed his song and it seems the other commentators followed the example. what at first seems to be a love story is really in terms of social placement and women as sacrificed mothers. the end of the movie does not make him a hero, it makes everything sad. and sad that people think he is a hero. maybe this is the movie comment that people should take. positive reception reflects patriarchal currents in social consciousness. yuck.
