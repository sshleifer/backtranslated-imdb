I do not recommend this movie because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be on the Berber territory of Algeria, it was shot in the southern Tunisian desert (the completely different culture, I know that I am from Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element was the character of her accompanying aunt, she speaks in the French-language film very eloquently, while the character she is playing has to be a disturbed character who has never left the mountain type, the Bedouin of this type education and this context is impossible. The most shameful and disrespectful scene, especially for the people of the region, is the "femme repudiee" segment, which is a pure invention of the writer / director, things like this will never happen to an Algerian society ever!
