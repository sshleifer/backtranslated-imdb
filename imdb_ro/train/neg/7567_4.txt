The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She gets into a mental institution after she starts to think she is actually a cyborg. In the institution he meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a connection with her. If you read this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But "I am a Cyborg ..." is a great diversion from familiar territory and (unfortunately) stronger. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that's trying to do something different. God knows, we are all subject to the fools of our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I have to say is that she can not say anything about mental illness or create characters that interest you. This story must be one of the strangest things I have seen you for years ... but strange is not enough There is no heart for the movie ... just surrealism and confusion Confusion seems to be the theme The characters try to understand their own problems, but he himself is Chan-wook Park, which turns out to be the most confused of all.
