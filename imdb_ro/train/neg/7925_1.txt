Do you want a wonderful recipe for failure? Take a plot, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters, and throw away the most serious special effects that a horror film has ever known. Leave a chop for a week (the amount of time spent probably by spending this garbage). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that makes bad movies in dangerous and exotic places. The film blew completely. My words can not tell how painful it was to look. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and have fun with. This is not Plan 9 in outer space. This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest loss of energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people really were giving their life to act on it if you can call it acting. But again, when you have a bad direction, the bad story, everything poor, acting is the last thing you have to criticize. This movie is like a giant, disgusting flock that you want to disappoint quickly, afraid that a friend or a loved one might see it. Even with me, I could eventually destroy every copy of this movie, so it will not pollute the minds of the aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what is really terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just stupid or boring.
