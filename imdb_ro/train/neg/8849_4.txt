This is a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as the reputation suggests. Production values ​​are not too bad and there is an oddly effective scenario. And it has an 80-year-old veneer, which means it's always kind of fun. Look out for Jimmy Nail's brief appearance - his attempt to make the American accent is so amazing that it's fantastic. And the fantastic feelings are Sybil Danning's breasts - they make a short appearance in the film, but the scene is repeated many times in the end, credits in what can only be described as Sybil Danning's "remix of 12". It must be seen that it is believed. Like a horror film, it's not scary, the effects are foolish and Christopher Lee returns to sleepwalk through his performance. I think he bought a new house and needed some money for the deposit. woman - were so negligible that I forgot almost everything about them and I looked at this movie earlier tonight, werewolves are considerably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, weird, sometimes they looked more like madly burned monkeys. The European setting is pretty good and the music offered by the new Babel wave, while it is quite terrible, offers at least some added cheese to the film. Overall, good for a laugh. Are you tired Do you think it will be? And, at least, you always had Sybil's knockouts.
