Mister. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested in seeing what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it is undiscovered, though not because the jokes are not funny - some (I will not say the most) of them are, and in fact, Mr. Mike did a good job, translating his siphons mentally unbalanced into visual galleries. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing you call) is so terrible, the film is intolerable. Some costumes called "PKO Productions" get productive credit, but it does not seem at all productive; it seems that Mike stole one of the rooms in the SNL set and did everything on an afternoon. I realize that Mike's purpose was to torture the public, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear, or understand what should shock. However, the DVD is not a complete waste: it includes a belief for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three stories of SNL's "Mike's Little Loved Bedtime." In addition, the "swimming in the cat" section of the movie is an extraordinary scene that can be caught looking if you want to hope someone out there. 3/10
