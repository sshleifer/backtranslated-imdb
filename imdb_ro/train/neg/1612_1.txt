It is incredible that with all the countless crimes that have been unearthed and placed unmistakably on the brink of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago until the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer River, we still find admirers of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and still do propaganda its favor. It shows only the moral depravity of Hollywood. In this particular film, a psychotic killer is glorified. Needless to say, neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect the audience to sit in this seemingly endless propaganda film demonstrates the vision of the tunnel they have about their worship.
