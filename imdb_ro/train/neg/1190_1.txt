Poor Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring this down. <br /> <br /> Flay being the worst. Definitely a pony with a trick, I think he could get other American chefs to come to eat at this table as iron chefs. The type of dishes that this duo really does ... does not reflect on the creativity of the original series of iron chefs. I do not think Batali even went to school. There are a lot of excellent chefs in America, I wonder why they do not appear in the Food Network. It would also help to get more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts that can handle pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he's a little too flippant / funny for this role.
