If you have not seen this yet, I just tell you to go ahead, take a stroll in the park, do not waste your time. Neither the script nor the act deserves your money. * Spoilers * - Can not decide what's worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's talented talent is very controversial. I hope it can improve over time. The story is just unbelievable. Loose American police cannon fight criminals in Europe on their own? Infamous mafia slave protected by just two pieces ??? A professor of emotional art that leads a ruthless band ??? The Spanish Execution Execution of the Police than a Bag of Hammers ??? Save me. There is only one good thing about this movie, though: At least, production costs must be lower than those of Ocean's 12, which were just as meaningless and above the top as this one.
