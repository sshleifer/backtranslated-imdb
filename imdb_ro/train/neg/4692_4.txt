When I first saw this movie, it was called TERORR ON A TRAIN and it was the back half of a double feature. Glenn Ford, an arms expert, is called to defuse a hidden bomb in a train loaded with large explosives. The tension is slow and constant; and this black and white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; tension and drama have lost most of the impact. This is still a good film in terms of early 50s. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / sabote is played by Victor Maddern.
