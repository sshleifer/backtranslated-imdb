Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but the "Transylvanian Niki" is too late. We already have enough and we want something new. Big directors should not have trouble seeing beyond their time, not behind. Why do people view Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? We are only born, not uninhabited, and no one ever gives any of the old times. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of film consumers do not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian film, not the final song - watch! Maybe young directors should make the move.
