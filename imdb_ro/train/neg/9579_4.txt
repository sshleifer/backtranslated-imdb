Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (I WANT!) With Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF THE DEAT 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert resident who pulls out a bank heist with friend Johnny (Jason Durr ). He arrives in a prison south of the border, headed by Sadic's Head Screw (a Robert Englund who gets stuck in a toe). She and her beloved poodles end up hiding at a gas station monastery until they are transformed by a recently fallen meteorite. The dogs turn into a devious queen, and Candy develops a very long language, speaking of a tame killing she can not control. Thugs looking for stolen booty and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications. First of all, Clarke is fantastic and does what it is to do with this movie. You look at her and you see someone very funny during the hunting scene, very convincing during horror scenes and very sexy in various wigs and disguises, including a latex leather cloth and wonder how this actress does not is a huge star. It is too bad that the rest of this cult attempt does not amount to her promise. He answers Sciamma's director / writer, who thinks the extraordinary premise is enough to support laughs ... but his vulgar gags, annoying support characters and stupid dialogue are not a substitute for a true sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the movie seems to be inexpensive, lots of colors and bright sets are strangled by muddy pictures and dusty desert places. Fortunately for Sciamma that Clarke is in his movie, because she alone keeps you looking.
