Frankly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a series of cartoons with lots of fun (but redeveloped and exaggerated) Bush's jokes. It seems that I should have reduced my expectations even more. The writing was absolutely pathetic. Besides Cheney-Chicken-Eating jokes, and some little tricks, he was very boring and unhappy. The animation was as sophisticated as a 13-year Flash project. It's embarrassing to have used Macromedia for that because it's a lot more capable. I do not like Bush so much, and I'm enjoying a Bush joke as much as the next guy, but it was only a short half an hour to the president with some painful and unpleasant moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with "That's My Bush." Make a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short comedy "That's My Bush." You'll thank me.
