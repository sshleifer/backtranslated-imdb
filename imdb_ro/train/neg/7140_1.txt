You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should include one of the most beautiful cars. Why the machines should be not only the victim of a violation but also the only real actors and interpreters in it. So, on Earth, Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and destroy your reputation for giving millions. You support getting a car advantage and you earn money on your chest. It's painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. I want my money back !!!
