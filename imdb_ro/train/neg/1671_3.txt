I saw this on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheap product - nothing's wrong with that, but you have to compensate it with a bit of sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done for manufacturers to close his image. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the spacecraft that descends is hilarious - you can imagine all the crew's hands trembling! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people who did this well - at least not pretentious.
