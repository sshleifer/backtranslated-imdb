This is obviously a movie about multiple pain. As such, it should move the spectators and make them empathic with the main character's situation. However, its postmodern irritating style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera switches from one scene to the next, from one personal crisis to another, creating a distorted and disjunctive effect. Most characters seem to live lifeless, unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (Also, the credibility of a man who has just received what a death sentence means, he happily indulged in a sexual relationship with a woman he just met). The story (if there is a story) is difficult to follow. In conclusion, the overall effect is quite disappointing. However, the act is generally good and some of the scenes are pretty strong.
