From the nepotism chapter of the world comes another junk in a fancy pack. "CQ," says a handsome, disordered story that's a little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a babe and a straight man, Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi movie. I'm not thinking of any reason why someone would like to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to shoot. (D)
