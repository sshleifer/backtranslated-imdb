Roy Rogers and the company are trying to bring back "Sintown" - it's a ghost town that could go into explosion if silver exploitation is successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") around the paper. Jane Frazee (in the role of Carol) is losing a bit of bitches to Mr Rogers's sharp pointer. Foy Willing and Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or is it singing?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from Laurel and Hardy) adds the "Grand Canyon Trail" "slapstick" appearance. An unlisted floor pad provides the winning comedy performance. Devine's hurt hit his heels. There are also energetic human performances - but the material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
