Following this, I've noticed in particular ad placements. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It's a product placement after another. It is quite clear how he got funding for this film. The act of Jessica Simpson is ridiculous. Any Dick should never get a job because it plays the same lamecheros character. The "story" is just a background for this very long time. I can not believe the film was even considered for the theatrical release. The more you watch this movie the more embarrassed you are to all the people involved. The only minor rescue grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who have almost no screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm ashamed to see everything. I would recommend avoiding this.
