There is a reason why some movies go directly to the video, and of course the obvious reason is that if the audience is too shy for the theater audience it will be released directly on the video. Of course, it really would not be right with movies that are good and yet they are also released directly to the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least potential actors: Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson deserving roles a departure from adolescent melodramas. The film is also wrong: this movie takes place before Cruel Intentions, so this movie is, in fact, a prequel and quite stupid at that. It was a waste and, indeed, a film that is at the same level as soft porn movies and pay-per-view masturbation films. Fortunately for the actors, we hope they will be able to delete this from their CVs. So if you want to see something unpleasant, but you do not have the courage to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
