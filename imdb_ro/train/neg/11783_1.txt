What a terrible movie! Worst of the worst! This movie is just as fun as a dead slug. There are no talents, no actors, no stupid plot. Who wrote this script? Has there ever been a script for this dreadful movie or the director accidentally pressed the recording button on his camera and then decided to make the movie as they walked along? Does that mean to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? My younger friends are in the 6th grade and he and his colleagues have made an amateur movie for their school project that surpassed this geeky film. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life my! There is no excuse for this movie!
