This is undoubtedly the most offensive "chicken blow" I have seen for years, if not ever. Writing and characterization are so stereotypical that the film is parodying. Before going out of the theater for an hour and five minutes in this disaster, I was subject to the following themes: having a child will solve all your problems, "artists" are miserable misery and musicians can not be good mothers than throw their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a loss of a talented cast and wonderful sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that if he did not live a more common life, he would end up - trembling - "alone!" I felt uncomfortable. I can not believe that this film has reached the release of the show. It's the kind of fare that awaits you from the cable channels "women" that they always go through when I sail through the canal. I'm a woman and over 35, so I should be part of the target audience of this movie, but boy, do not lose the target "Evening."
