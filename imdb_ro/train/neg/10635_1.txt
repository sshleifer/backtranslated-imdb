There is a remark that one of the heroes was raped by "Russian soldiers" by "Russian soldiers", which is completely untrue. This movie should not be displayed just because of this. There is also a person's statement that the KGB chose "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis." The KGB sought out the so-called "Zionist" agents, who were (KGB aggressors) imperialist agents. This is altogether different from the goal of Jewry as a whole nation, as the Nazis did. Gypsies have never been prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool and politically used, but from an international point of view. Communists did not distinguish between nationalities. The film is as fake. The main hero does not speak Russian, the signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, the KGB general looks completely fake. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are completely composed, and the list goes on and on. It's not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and fake stuff. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
