I had great hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The movie was guided so badly that it made stomach pains. Pacing was so slow, the dialogue was ridiculous and the movie - far from a beautiful fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was superficial. Why, why Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to fit "consumer approval". Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted for 10 years, and Achilles was killed by Paris, outside the walls of Troy, with an arrow to his ankle! It bothers me that such a classic story is turned into a soap. And you do not even turn me on the "lack of" chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman of the war, and it did not even seem that the two were fond of each other. No spark, no emotion, no hope. I have to say in the defense of the films Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole has acted very well with a bad scenario, but that is not enough to save this dreadful movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the 200 million budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used in the funeral forts - where did all those trees come from? I'm so disappointed it hurts.
