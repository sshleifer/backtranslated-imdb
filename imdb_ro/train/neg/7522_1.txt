Wow ... where to start ... took this at Big Lots just for 2.99 USD. There are three dollars that I will never see again ... ever ... and for what? I will tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring and college agitation that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror film announced on the box. (More marketing droides that designed it to burn in hell for all eternity). Follow him with a little cheap gore (do not even worry about yourself ...) and a plot of plot at the end that comes out of nowhere and it makes no sense. Great, terrible, terrible ... Have there been redeeming qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, six breasts were involved, but it's not worth losing me for three years. Without this, this could be on Sci-Fi at, for example, two or three in the morning ... Bmoviefreak
