Since its release in 1983, "Christmas Story," Jean Shepherd's story about his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story," however, still has Shepherd as a narrator, but she has absolutely no charm, and the characters are no closer to the original movie. "My Summer Story" is basically a mishmash of mediocre stories and simply not very interesting, which include hillbilly neighbors and fight tops. Charles Grodin, who I usually like, is extremely inappropriate in the role of the father (better handled by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character seems to be nothing more than forced. Kiernan Culkin is a weak substitute for Ralphie, and the younger brother is forgotten here. Only mom seems to deserve it here and maybe because she beats a cinema manager with a sauce boat when she pushes her too much luck with the ugly wives on a "free night". are largely inconsistent and stretched on thin paper. He can appeal to the extremely unusual film, but as a sequel to "A Christmas Story," it is a very poor one and is not worth the time of most people. 2 out of 10.
