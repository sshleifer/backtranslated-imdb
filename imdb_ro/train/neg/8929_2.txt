This blend adapted from a novel by Gore Vidal (in fact, one of the great American writers) makes THE CHRISTIAN MAGIC and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like Fellini artworks. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and not really tall) with the lead role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER when he was good enough) playing the role of Rex Reed (critic of the film, not critical) alter-ego Mae West , the young and the "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors, what a pity) and other varieties of azoes to claim that they would be tricking for it, except for the old clips of intermediate films (ie Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne ) ... just to be able to continue to bleed life around the world. A 2 out of 10. The best performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
