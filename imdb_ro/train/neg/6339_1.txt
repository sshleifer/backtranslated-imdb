All David Prior's films are terrible in all respects: bad writing, bad act, bad cinema, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as a male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plan of almost all David Prior's films (as I like to say) is basically the same. The team of American commando men throw up Communist warriors. But unlike the Cold War garbage dumps, such as Red Dawn, Prior's films are actually amusing because of the premise and actors all over the place. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or the other guy?) Is summoned by General Mitchell for a top secret mission in South America. The funniest line of the movie is then delivered, which means "this is my roommate, I trained him well." WHAT THE. Have you prepared your roommate? And, apparently, this will be their solution to avoid evacuation. If you can find these video stones used anywhere, BUY NOW. They are fun and even funny after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends for a real MST3K style experience. So far, my friends and I have managed to get a nightclub and aerobic war known as "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most of all is Final Sanction, with Robert Z'dar, strangely portrayed.
