I do not like even losing the time to write 10 lines about this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that bad shooting is not a capital crime or that he would have been killed twice to write and lead this disaster. I'm amazed that this film had a budget of $ 75 million, but actually pleased that it was such a great flop that Shim hoped he would never make another movie for the rest of his life and, therefore, more movie time. I would have thought the actors would have gathered and lied him so far. With the effects resources they had at their disposal, a great movie could have been made with this budget. As usual, failure should have been seen from scratch and the terrible story from the beginning. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a poor screenplay, but that makes it look like "Citizen Kane."
