Such a long awaited movie. But it disappointed me and my friends who went to see the movie on the first day. The trailers seemed like a action movie but it turned out to be a comedy out & out a comedy bad). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the action of these professional actors, they have done their part very well in the film. It works well, but I do not think it can save the movie .. India was shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) They were saturated with color, good. However, the way in which the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot determined me to find out where exactly those places were and when I could go there ;-) The sequences of action were shot very little, no one could make headaches and the queue of the waterfalls, used Akki very well (akshay kumar), but it could have done much better. Animation is the worst I've seen in recent movies 90 movies had better animation scenes believe (the original scene where the car falls off "flying should be the better word" the road in the lake). And the name of the movies was mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes, just to make sure the audience does not forget the name of the movie.
