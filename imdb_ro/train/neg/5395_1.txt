Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn the obscure comedy, rarely produced by William Shakspeare into a 1930s music, resulting in both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy, the actors rarely adhere to one or the other of the two styles, and in Some cases of bad flounder in both. Nathan Lane is particularly painful, which seems to be under the impression that she is absolutely hysterical like Costard, but she is wrong and Alicia Silverstone dealing with Shakespearean language with the full authority of a teenage girl who reads aloud in her English class English class. The musical numbers are organized with the expertise of a high school production "Dames at Sea", leaving the play to look strange and amateur while singing and dancing, with the only exception being Adrian Lester, who turns out to be a splendid song and dancing man. The only other rescuer of the film is Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's contribution as eye candy, but they did much better than in this movie and you would be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filming witless misery a pass.
