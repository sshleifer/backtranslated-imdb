I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and it was nothing. So I did. What really does to me is that it does not make sense, and that's why it's disturbing. Richard gets tied to chicken wire, and Jarvis starts running away with Richard's face while she's unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend, Troubador, plays a bad song on the guitar. The next morning it shows that Richard's face speaks to Jarvis and Trouby, and then returns to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied. Then he plays happy music and the movie is over. What happened? Did they brake? And what did he say to these two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? Tangled him and the poor to. I can not make movies that are disturbing and do not make sense. This was the worst movie I've ever seen since Lord's 90th fly.
