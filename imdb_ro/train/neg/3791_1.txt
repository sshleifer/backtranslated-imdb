I can not vote for this because I will not track garbage from these people. They took my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and swore it would never happen again. I think it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums on this movie and read where cast members are trying to behave as if they were seeing the movie for the first time. A guy just answers himself ... using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (under any circumstances). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first one. That means movie 3 should be much better. Not so, I saw it. All I want to know is how you distribute this garbage using the same name all the time. Having fun with your friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine ... but do not try to sell that trash!
