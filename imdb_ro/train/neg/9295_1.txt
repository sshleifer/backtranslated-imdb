I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Nice cinemas and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping to resume Hero, but this is much, much worse. This film is why kung fu films had a bad reputation in the first place. No credible characters (even in the world of kung fu cartoon, these characters are ridiculous), basically no plot and ridiculous tale of story. This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a game of believing with a child. Every time you think your bad fight makes sense, they invest another ridicule that does not make sense ("Ah ha, you think you caught me with your super powers and the 10,000-gun, we ate the vitamins filled with plutonium and teflon, so your rams do not work and are invulnerable to your superb powers ... touch do not touch the backward inflow PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this weakness, because they do not they care if someone listens because they have a fun time. However, for VIEWER, especially for adults, this long movie is worse than a bad gas match. SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu film producers, (a) if you have a knife in the back it hurts if you are not on PCP, kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall back, having a knife in it, it will hurt more and will do more harm if it is not (c) when you stab stabbing yourself with a knife, you will die, especially in ancient China, where there is not a Permanent Kaiser around the corner, ) kung fu fights do not last for hours while 3 snow feet collapse and sometimes it is worth explaining their characters and motivations. In any case, go see Hero again, because at least in his own little world it's easy to understand.
