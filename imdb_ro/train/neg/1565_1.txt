The film uses a cutting-edge title for an agonizing story. Kill Kill, it would have been nice. The film includes taboos to make the spectator move into their seats. Scenes are not needed and are tangled. The film is something a novice screen writer could have provoked. Just a waste of movie props and network money. I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it does not deserve 10 lines of my time, but I have to resist people avoiding stupidity. If people rely on you to choose a good movie for the night movie, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not damage it by subjecting yourself to this dirt.
