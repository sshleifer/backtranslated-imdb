I feel like I just watched a tobacco film ... a beautiful thing, lousy, attractive and horrible! A perversion liturgy of two hours in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, burial of life and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption. And we were amused. I could not forget. What does this say about me, about people doing and acting in such things, and about a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real cigarette movies will be the norms. And I'm not Puritan or humorous, I'm not trying to hide from the existence of darkness and I certainly did not lead a protected life, but I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​pulling the submarines the way my own tribe does. It does not have to be comfortable, but does it have to deal with vicarious sadism?
