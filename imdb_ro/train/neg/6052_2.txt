Despite his flaws, I liked "Cigarette Burns," John Carpenter's first episode of the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and the time constraints that were given to it. With Pro-Life, however, budget and time constraints certainly show more than anything else. There are solid directions as usual from Carpenter, but there is a quality of writing and of all production itself that gives the feeling that it has been done in a complete and complete hurry. The script is not always clear, the message is unclear, and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. Perhaps Carpenter has re-written the script, it could have been a useful episode. Instead, it's a mess that only Carpenter hardcore fans will find the least joy. Certainly, the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
