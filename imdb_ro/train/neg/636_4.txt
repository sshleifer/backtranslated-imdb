Several farmers struggle alive in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the main roles, speaking with false accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and earth are the best things people have. They are seen as property and investment. Since it is a great budget film, many extras are working together, large sets are being built and special effects are taking place, filmmakers can not take the risk of engaging less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Oscar for this show, which is certainly the worst in the movie. Her unbearable face creates a barrier between her and the public. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize. On the other hand, Paul Muni offers better performance, showing talent again. Another problem with the movie is the end. It seems Franklin did not know when to end the image. This movie could be dangerous if taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
