Imagine a woman alone in a house for forty-five minutes, in which absolutely nothing happens. Then, it lasts twice. The writing is full and lifeless, jokes unhappy, and bad action prevents you from taking care of any of the characters, even when fighting wolves and being beaten by brotherhood. Anyone who has rated this movie more than two is not entirely normal.
