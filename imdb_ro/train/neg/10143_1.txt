FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the biggest hit on Steven Seagal that I've ever seen ... Until now. It's a terrible hole, with no action scenes of interest, Seagal is not really trying this - it's fat and his voice is doubled once more. Co-stars do not get better, being a pretty bad charge by the third redeemer. by Keusch is very poor and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another Seagal couple (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The Co-written script by Seagal himself is ridiculously ineffective. IMDb $ 12M have been spent on this boring old tosh load - If these figures are correct, I feel a great violin of taxes as no sum has been spent. FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for a remake shot from Michael Dudikoff's BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than that. <br /> <br /> This has no redeeming qualities, Give it a MISS! 1/2 * of *****
