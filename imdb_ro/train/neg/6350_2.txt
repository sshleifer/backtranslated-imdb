I saw part of Woody Allen's movies and, although not always great, you can be sure you will be entertained. Perhaps the last very good lasts were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then the ones I've seen have been irregular but can be tracked. And when I was invited to see the new film Woody Allen Melinda and Melinda, about which I did not even know he was released yet, I went happily. I did not hear too much about it, so I was hoping to be surprised. What I received was definitely the worst movie of Woody Allen I've seen. The premise is over-explained, the distribution is terrible, the scenario is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes have said nothing, and yet they have been stretched, I suppose I will fill in what otherwise would have become a 15 minute short story. I do not mind the concept behind this movie - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy and obviously the movie continues to show us that by playing both scenarios. The problem is that none of these "two movies" is good at all. Comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. Apparently Allen came up with a good idea, but then he ran out of steam or time to actually complete the movie. The overall level of action is also bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table and is basically an impression of Woody Allen. Good actors, such as Chloe Sevigny, have unleashed, and the worst of them is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is almost in any scene!). right to the actors, the scenario with which they work is lacking if not nonexistent. Clearly, a long way from Allen that we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
