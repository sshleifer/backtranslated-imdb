I have to admit that I blocked the latter believing that something must happen next to the body in the first scenes ... and its arrangement of it. I was wrong. It was a cinematic verity of Betty that hits the beach encapsulated for the first part by Mordant Morven. I really do not care what young young women in Scotland do today, who you sang, what drugs I take. From a visual point of view, the walk through Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was enjoyable and certainly the highest for me. The Nadir was the chopping shop for her dead boyfriend. When the movie ended, I had two thoughts ... 1. Is that all? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend has committed suicide. Rename it. "Bored boredom, or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm so stupid because I broke them.
