1940. - A visit to the Nazi-occupied Lodz ghetto in Poland, recorded by a German cameraman with a naive co-operation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive images, international news clips and extracts from cultural films portraying Jewish world as scammers and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A sincere, cinematic expression of racial hatred. I personally find this scary and very offensive movie. We can only hope that such images like this will never reach the screen.
