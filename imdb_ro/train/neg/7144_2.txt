It's almost worthwhile to stay with this "brilliant" movie to know that I can never live as bad as this. Actor - 0, scenario - 0, battle scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (cheddar bob from 8 miles as suave war hero who takes her face), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is gorgeous and not a horrific actress ). These are the criteria I used to mediate at two. I've lost counting, but I think the movie clique is in this movie. When the driver who murdered her father miraculously, he would show up all the way to race against her, where he had not cemented the previous statement. Plus, it does not appear for no reason. It has never been mentioned. I do not know what to say here. Look at it only when it's on the TV in a few years. At least in this way, some of them will be edited for commercials.
