I recently bought the DVD, forgetting how much I hated the version of "A Chorus Line". Every change made by director Attenborough to the story has failed. With the Cassie Director's relationship being so prominent, the whole premise of the music ensemble sails through the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers are rushed and rushed. The song hit by the show becomes the whole meaning of being shattered when given the character of Cassie. General maintenance is very self-conscious. The only reason I give her a 2 is due to the fact that some of the big numbers are still able to enjoy despite the film's attempt to squeeze out of joy any joy and spontaneity.
