There is an UK edition to this show, which is less extravagant than the American version. The person in question will receive a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and a bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have. The American version of this show is all that TV reality should not be. Instead of making some improvements to a home that the occupants could not afford or do, the whole house is being rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show how there is a social welfare system in the United States or if you're pretty tough to get. The placement of quite vulgar products that takes place, especially by Sears, is also unforeseen. Rather than turning a family into a disadvantaged area into potential millionaires, it would be better to help the community as a whole, instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a house, building something for the whole community ..... maybe a place where diy and electric tools can be borrowed and returned with construction materials so that everyone can benefit if they want to. Putting one person alone can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same living quarters.
