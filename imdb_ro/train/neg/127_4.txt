I hired I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversies surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was first seized by American customs if it ever tried to enter this country, a movie fan considered "controversial," I really had this for me. The plot is centered around a young student of Swedish drama Lena, who wants to learn everything about life. In particular, she wants to focus on a documentary on what the medieval thought about some political issues like the Vietnam War and race problems in the United States. Between politicians and ordinary people's questions in Stockholm about their views on politics, she has sex with the theater professor, classmates and married men. What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Indeed, sex scenes and nudity are few and far removed, even then they are not shot as cheap porn. While my fellow countryman thinks it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major topic in the Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, certainly their response to the old old John Ford, had sexual scenes in his films. I congratulate the filmmakers on the fact that any sex presented in the film is presented for artistic purposes rather than shock people and make money to be broadcast in porn theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone wishing to study meat and potatoes (without any intention to play) of Swedish cinema. But indeed, this film does not have much of a plot.
