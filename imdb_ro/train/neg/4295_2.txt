This is still a depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very unfortunate and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I waited for her to take her, but, unfortunately, she never did. The act is right, but the script needs a lot of things. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste your time with these so hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and lack of subtitles, I lost 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen more than five homosexual films or have recently faced the fact that you are gay, you can find this exciting movie, otherwise your low-budget movie is run-of-the-mill. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
