It was really terrible! He had a terrible story, he was badly acting and was like an amateur remake of dead evil, but not as good. It took me all the tenacity to get through it, it's a good job I did not have to visit the toilet something else I doubt I'd be back! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like a great epic in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The only value for this movie was the never-ending offer of beautiful women. He is not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to leave with your friends after a night on beer, then this is for you ... otherwise avoid the plague!
