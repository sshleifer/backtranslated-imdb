After I did not read the novel, I can not tell how faithful this film is. The story is a typical mysterious material: the killer targets young people; a female investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Yeah, it sounds like a soap opera and that's how it works. The first two thirds are boring, except killing, and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback because it speeds up the speed to the controversial conclusion. Action is strictly sub-par, although it is hard to come to actors alone: ​​the scenario is atrocious. During the last third you will no longer notice, because the movie becomes interesting, but this is only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there are just so many things he can do with a TV budget, and the censorship of the network on his back. He's pretty limited to quick cuts and distorted lenses, though he managed to get hold of a couple under the floor during the crimes in the club's toilet. Unfortunately, because this is done for the TV, the cool compositional details it uses so well with a wider picture are not found somewhere. Manufacturer Note: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when hiring him. Summing up: this movie is bad by cinematographic standards and mediocre by TV standards (see CSI in exchange). If you have a mood for such a movie, I have some great suggestions: pick up a copy of Dario Argento "Deep Red", "Opera" or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in each category.
