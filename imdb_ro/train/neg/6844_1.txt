I have a copy of this on VHS, I think (Television Networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. Let's not forget what it was and remind us not to make the same mistakes again. Like putting some people in the director's chair, where they do not belong. This "Rappin" is like a Vaudevillian musical for those who can not sing or act. This movie is as fun as trying to teach "blind" to drive an urban bus. John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of jail and headed for the old neighborhood. While serving for a crime of necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by hunting dogs and his colleagues while dancing and singing all the way. I would recommend this if I were sentimental or if someone really smoked medicated pots prescribed by a glaucoma doctor. Anyway, this is a badly written, scripted, acted, and even produced (I did not think I'd put it) satire of the life of the Hood ghetto. Although, I think the redemptive part of the story, through combat sequences and dance numbers, friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn and cleaned. <br /> <br /> Forget the Sonny spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for this compared to this Rap. Well, if you feel you're laughing at nonsense and three embarrassed quarters, make sure you drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, follow with responsibility. (No star, more luck next time!)
