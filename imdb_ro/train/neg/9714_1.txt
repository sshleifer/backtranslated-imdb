I hate this program: it's not just a very absurd concept, but it's trying so hard to be feasible (something that has been left out of the same "confess" end of programs as Muder: she wrote)> Suspine. Why do writers never be smart enough in this program to come up with evidence to stand and win a court decision? Come on: after the X of the years that are unresolved, why should it be SUSPECTED, EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn!) Of a crime that would otherwise be unresolved? I bet all the police officers want the criminals to be these good athletes: "Aw, tricks, officer, you're a bright person - I think if you found out enough to convince you that I did, I could admit and I can help you more easily in court ... a fair policeman. "<br /> <br /> Absolute dog s ** t and an insult to those of us with enough brain to even hear of IQ
