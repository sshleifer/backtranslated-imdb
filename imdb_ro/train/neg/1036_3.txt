Ho-Hum. A deadly biological weapon of the inventor (Horst Buchholz) is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Undoubtedly, his son (Luke Perry) works along the antecedent. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and start tracking cars and mice and gun shots. Also in the distribution are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and Roger Moore. Moore seems to be moving strangely through this mess, certainly not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will accept. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but it's good to look.
