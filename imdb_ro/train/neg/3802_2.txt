I know actors and actresses want to try different types of movies - hey, nobody wants to dress in print - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd ought to know better than this. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie in which everything is lost until someone or something magic comes and saves the day. Do I really have to tell you how it's over? The film is just a bad escapism (examples of great escapism are the various SF films of the 1950s). If these films had a subtle policy - or at least they gave us a new look on life - then it would be good; this is just useless. Closer to a diabolic than an angel. They also try Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey and claim they do not want to emphasize this in their CVs.
