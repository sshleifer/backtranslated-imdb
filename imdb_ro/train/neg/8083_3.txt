Disappointed by Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster drove the Japanese theaters before coming to the United States and going straight to the video, where it was not seen again until the Turner networks needed anything but the infomercial to spot, and fill the slots of 3 am-6 am band at the bottom of the basket. Smithee's name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so much that the director does not want to attract his name. But I'm afraid Sarafian can not blame this studio entirely on the studio. Actors, most recent graduates from Overacting 101, offer a line of cornbobs to another. The land is surrounded. The special effects are not impressive. Parties that are not ridiculous are just boring. The script or book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this dud? But something went wrong on the side of the page on the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not even bad enough to be so bad - it's good.
