I was known as sleeping during filming, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, very tired, warm and comfortable on setting and eating a lot. However, on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was garbage. The development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and boring. Things seemed to happen, but without explanation of what caused them or why. I admit, I lost some of the movie, but I looked at most of it and everything seemed to happen on its own without any real concern for anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
