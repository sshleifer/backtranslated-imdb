I have to agree with most of the opinion that this show was produced poorly and in writing. The actor was not far above the lower production values, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the material that is offered to him and do the best. Consistent with this, I think it is important to emphasize that an actor has grown and persevered far beyond this plague, so that tasteless production becomes a respectable and talented performer. I'm referring to Laura Harris, a Canadian born actor, who engraved through many bad shows and movies to find a place in the HBO hit "Dead Like Me," where she plays Daisy Adair, and for her she handles this role in an efficient manner. I remember we had a typical battle on the young actress during this series in which she played Ashley a grammatically soft, but intelligent 7. I felt like if someone could "make" of this series, it would certainly be Laura Harris and true to her nature has done excellent acting in the field to earn the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as the unique blonde northern attraction. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, we recommend that you have something epic to follow such sections as "the godfather" or "the beaches" to remind you that there is, in fact, true production integrity and worth it and that this series is just a reminder of the budget that Laura Harris can tell about the time spent in the show and I bet she will quote many of the young actors' defense words, saying, "It's a start!"
