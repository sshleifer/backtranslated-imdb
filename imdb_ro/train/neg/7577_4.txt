This is just somewhat attractive for fans of "bad movie" entertainment. It is more important for the pop culture students of the 1970s: the fashion, the furniture, the attitudes and the great moment of the "lib women" from the early 70s, when it was still fresh and romantic for an independent independent woman. "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a career full of money, instead, if it remained stressful (after all, what is a flight attendant, but a waitress at 30,000 feet - and for those male) slept with more men, could protect themselves and others (with karate) and was not tied to anything. This is the kind of emancipated woman who frightened the antifeminism juices, those retrograde idiots who think that no woman is complete without a husband. <br /> <br /> "The Sexy Stewardess" was a powerful archetype of the late 1960s to the 1970s, (even in the "Partridge Family", I remember dressing in the Ruben Kincaid bachelor constantly with stewardesses) and, from this point of view, this stupid film is an important capsule of pre-AIDS pop culture, free love, lib, for women, seventy. However, the plot is quite terrible. And for those caves in the public, there are few naked breasts to look at.
