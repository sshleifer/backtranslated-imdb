Admirably strange, though frightening comedy drama about a weird young man who hopes to fly like a bird through Houston Astrodome. Quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman, with eccentric characters, is so overloaded with strange ones that he starts to get rid of weight. Some of the cinemas are evocative, Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tourist guide, and Sally Kellerman shows every inch glamorpuss that Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining his role They !). At the forefront, Bud Cort is - again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; not to put it like, for example, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, wacky and harmless, a tough act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's errors. He can put together a piece and piece of play like no one else, but to fire him with the wrong inspiration and spiral down. ** from ****
