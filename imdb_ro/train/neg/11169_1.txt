Are you kidding me?! A show that highlights someone who opens boxes and envelopes for a meal? How talented are you to be to do this? She may be able to cook but is not portrayed in this stomach for half an hour, generating painful production. I know he has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire. So is Warren Buffett, but I do not see him with falsifying collisions opening boxes of corn cream and Alpo. She has a grandchild called ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about someone so bad. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table-scapes" than real cooking. Who has that time ?! Silicone should be on the spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
