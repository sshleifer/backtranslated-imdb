WOW! I received this movie from a friend of mine who bought him for 1.98 at Walmart, and he felt it was taken! Beyond the boring, most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen, the actress is somewhat improvised, almost as if she did not have a script. Martians are CGIs, which seem to be made by a novice or a Fan movie. I can not emphasize how bad this DVD really is! Example: In one of the scenes, martians torture a captive local female. It goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a CGI copy of that woman. The change is completely visible, and when killed, you can see it is a computer figure, pointing to something in a 1990 game! If possible, avoid this movie like plague! You can download two trailers on their site and you can see how terrible it really is!
