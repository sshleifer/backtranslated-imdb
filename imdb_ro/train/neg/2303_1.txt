Except people apparently buy in this trash! For example, "The Orel Morale", even if you tried to make the most scandalous parody of evangelism from the beginning, you might think about it, it would not come close to the hilariousness of the show. It's hard to say what happens even when you follow it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start by referring to different international news, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this strange, troll-like guy, with a bigger forehead than his whole face, mumping and laughing, and generally creepy. > <br /> Pat Robertson does not even seem to be a bad guy at first glance. It just seems like a vague senile but innocently old blocked in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who demanded an assassination, who had become friends and helped only one, but TWO killer dictators who illegally used donation money to run diamond mines that supported forced abortions in China and involving on a regular basis that those Caucasians (especially American Caucasians) are superior to all other races. Still, all this would be fun, except that it apparently has a large enough base to keep its little show on the air 40 years later (whether that or enough money to bribe some television directors who do not give the damn what it looks). The idiom of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people somewhere have to look at it and stand on every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people are listening to him. I do not know if it's funny or frightening. I think a healthy mixture of both.
