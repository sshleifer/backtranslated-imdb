I do not know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against him. Perhaps the characters were so steadfast and not convincing enough to care. Perhaps it was the disorganized story. Perhaps it was that Rob Lowe wore a long earring and long glasses. Perhaps it was because, at some point in the movie, everyone is bursting into the song. Maybe because the 1980s were never in the '80s. Maybe it was because it was a hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character pumped his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out. I do not know why I hated myself like that, but if it means trying to look again, I'm not willing to know.
