Ok this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious about the movie they just wore through an apocalyptic war, but they have the money to buy huge robots and destroy each other. Each country decides, instead of investing in rebuilding the country, to fight rather with robots that no one can afford. Here's a better idea, allow yourself to rely on our most useless, jocks resources to fight our struggles. <br /> <br /> Everybody says about the director, how about him. Make a good movie, make a bad movie. Is there no reason to give this film credit just because of the director, maybe he's asleep? I enjoyed this movie very much, because it was so dark and ridiculous, I had to laugh. Actually, I looked good, except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin (believe me no one will see this guy as an assassin, so it's a surprise, no matter how cowardly) What kind of exercise training is a jungle jim anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k did not do that. I give a two-star note, however, because nothing could be as bad as "the hand of the hands of fate". Budget never matters, I saw a lot of reasonable films that had nothing for budgets like the cube. The story was not even plausible and I saw better action in the school pieces. Surly, they could have provided an eleven-year-old child from any middle school game. Anyway, pick it up, it's a fun movie to watch.
