A truly horrible movie. I did not know at first that it was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I began to realize that all the characters were talking with kiwi accents disgusted by the American counterfeit. Why had to be established in America anyway? - it could have been established in the NZ and then the actors could have used their usual voices. Certainly someone in the production team heard the terrible attempts to talk with American accents? Bad bad movie. I'm surprised it took so long - how did she make it from the cup? It seemed a very weak test to a Segal / Willis type of action. A TOTAL MONEY WASTE! If there was some money in this garbage, I would lead a revolution to put all the money back in the Treasury. I'm still wandering (take it, huiduÄƒ, twisted!) In the absolute garbage I just saw. Why have we followed? Well, I'm a fanatic film and I can not help, myself!
