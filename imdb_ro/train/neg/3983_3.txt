Irene Dunne has finished her illustrious career with this film so similar. She should have gone with a bang, being the classic actress she was doing, not in this unparalleled, almost unknown film. <br /> <br /> This easy comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is much better because it gets pretty bad in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and give up. Even her uplifting voice has become a little annoying here. Rumors say she was not happy with this movie. You can see why. The story reminded me of a television sitcom in the 1950s. Speaking about this, I thought David Nelson from TV show Ozzie & Harriet was in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. Generally, so best and a sub-par for a great actress.
