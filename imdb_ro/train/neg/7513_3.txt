What can I say? I think I have to write "Alert Spoiler" and then "reveal" that they used the word FULL in this movie - as in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too many suggestions about sexual perversions, detours and cheats. And the oath was entirely out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy moves on the dance floor.
