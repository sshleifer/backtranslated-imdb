I have a question for those who were thinking about this idea. Why? What made them think about making a second movie about it. If the memory serves, Cinderella did not end up with "Everyone lived happily ever after"? I'm sure she did it or it was implicit. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily afterwards, how could it be a sequel? If they did not try to make the most boring story in history, it could not be a sequel. I mean, they might have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends with "Happy Ever After" can not have a sequel; if not, then I never live happily afterwards! Something has to go wrong, which causes problems with the first end! Why? It's not good, it's bad. This is my last word on this subject.
