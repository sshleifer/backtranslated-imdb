I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said the reason why it was so cheap was that the disc was scratched but did not recall that the reason it was so cheap was that the movie was a weak effort that sucks harder than Paris Hilton in a home video from the hotel room. Speaking of home movies, since it was an honest game to release them as movies - I mean, the movies used to hire actors, technicians and scriptwriters and so on - no more - just gather your friends and lame ideas for a weekend, produce a £ 8.00 production and let someone down the stairs with a Casio keyboard - then snap it on the shelves for some soap poor (I) despair. But here's the clark - I quickly returned to the majority, and I threw him to one side, ready for the hammers ... until the next night, while pursuing a Darren Day "Hellbreed" horror (£ 1 , 99 to take home and keep from another blockbuster). Now, this movie has made "Grim Weekend" look like The Exorcist, so we've slapped the new Grim Weekend to catch some of the moments on the big IMDb boards that viewers said they were hilarious. Sure enough, once we overcome the misery, the pain and the horror, realizing the Grim Weekend was a total rhythm of toasted bread, I could enjoy it, enjoy it, and get down to the fun stuff. And there are many. Check the panels. Then check the movement. Hell, it might even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
