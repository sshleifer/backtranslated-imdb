Eddie Murphy "Delirious" is complete and totally rude, brutal, crash and playful. This is, indeed, the only way to describe this terrible piece, stand-up trashy. Eddie Murphy goes about the value of shock rather than laughing to try to win his position. He manages to be funny occasionally, but especially loses the plot with an obscene language and disgusting sexual jokes. Look! Unless you enjoy the wrong style of Eddie. I do not think I'm going to bother with Eddie Murphy Raw. I prefer much Eddie within the limits of a movie script. Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
