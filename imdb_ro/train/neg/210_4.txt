Perhaps you should not compare, but the style and the war of wild style are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original artists in early Hip Hop, but it was obvious that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and is nice. But if you see this as an original Hip Hop culture, you are wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Look for the first two movies I've mentioned. They transmitted the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably due to the fact that although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction are all terrible, the music and the dance are what people love. I like dancing but at that moment I realized electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so glad when around the year 86 a new generation of classical Hip Hop artists appeared, such as Krs One, Enemy Public, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, the wild style does not have much story, but the music is great and authentic. Of course, tastes are different and that's fine. But, as far as I'm concerned, this film is garbage, except for the pause dance and some of the music, so I can not evaluate more than 4 out of ten.
