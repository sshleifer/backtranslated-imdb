This movie seems completely useless. There is no reason why everything in it happens as if it were written by a small child who was bored halfway and thought "how can I wrap this up?" And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did they do it for a bet? I could not tell you the story, I'm not sure there is one to be honest, but if it does not exist, it has not been recorded. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after falling down the stairs while mad, as you do. They walk into a house with a little annoying little girl, meet Christopher Walken who dug an ancient woman kept in the peat. He brings it back to life for another reason than the story goes on and she is recognizing her by immediately embarking on her. Since then, everything has become a little stupid. A few hours of life I would like back!
