While not as bad as it was done (seen much worse), it is still a very lame film. In fact, a rebalancing of "Coogan's Bluff" by Siegel, the main difference being that hat Clint Eastwood has more charisma than anything Joe Don Baker, a tireless actor if he had one. However, Venantino Venantini is great (and very fun) as the bad guy, the kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to stay in this steampilÄƒ, while the rest camp offers most terrible act, especially girls. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe it was once a romantic lead (watch "Mondo Cane" to see it running women). Looking here like a Ben Gazzara, he has nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And all of these have written on the generic 80 "action movie" that could not be more boring. Greydon Clark can best B-movies ( "without warning"), but here he travels, fall, break his nose and loses three teeth. At least the locations in Malta were beautiful and Venantini tried to save the day. 3/10.
