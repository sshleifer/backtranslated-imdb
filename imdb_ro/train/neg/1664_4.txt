This movie is quite fun because of Virginia Madsen's excellent performance and the fact that Lindsey Haun is great. However, the reason why the movie is so predictable is that I've seen it before. I did not read the mother's gift but I hope Britney and Lynne Spears are completely different from this movie. If you do not think of concluding a movie with an original idea, essentially a video, the whole movie brings to mind the plagiarism.
