Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge judges smaller than 1. What a shame. This terrible movie is so bad that we actually turned the damn thing to the end. The script had some bright moments, but the direction, editing, action, audio quality, and in particular on-line synchronization was so indignant that judges became extremely unbearable. Judges were published as a modern Western comic book day, but in reality there was nothing like that. Which is rather the dog dog on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it will stay moving. Why do video stores think it's okay to wear such nonsense with constant audio discrepancies, and worse than the high-school theater class works beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than what's on TV. But judges are worse than the most pathetic original SciFi Channel. I intend to call my money back from the Hollywood Video.
