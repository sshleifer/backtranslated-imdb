I saw this movie a few days ago and I jumped in a game during the frightening parts. I have to admit that I felt pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters were saying. Logical Issues: 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be a pretty good guy, does not make any sound while he's killed. Do not you think he would have tried at least to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When it is remarked that the teacher at the gym is "SOOOO loved by Lisa", I almost screamed on the screen. When the best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was in love with him, do not make any comments if you have half a heart. As soon as Nash asks Uncle how many exits he has in the house and the uncle finds there is danger ahead of him, he would not make smart things to make Donna, his friend, aunt and uncle in a car, and drive away , away, then bait the house with HRT and the police force, so the killer has no way to get out? And on. And on. Actually, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough for you to really feel any empathy when they were sacrificed and there were too many mistakes. However. <br /> <br /> This movie could be good for teenagers or young couples looking for just a fun night. If you do not consider all the goats, it's a mediocre movie.
