I was completely amped up to see this movie. I waited a year for it to be removed here in New Zealand. I should not have built so much because it was so disappointing and it is undoubtedly the worst movie of Clark. First of all, some of the acting is wonderful, especially Nick Stahl as "The Bully," and the brown hair girl (I do not remember the name), but most of it was so unbelievable and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in Kids, but in Bully he invests his lines with solemnity to turn his scenes into a practical parody. The script felt it was written by a first-year student. I'm not sorry, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Did he try to emphasize the lack of meaning of the existence of these children? Of course he would not have prevented him from going into a good perversion. I'm not cautious, but I do not need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still claim that Clark's best film is "Another Day in Paradise." It's fantastic and I do not think she'll ever do it.
