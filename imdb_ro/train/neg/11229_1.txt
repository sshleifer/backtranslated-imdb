They made me look at this in school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. Episodes become confused, because the deed is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. Teachers talked about it as a treatment, but it really was a painful, boring experience. I read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them do what they do in the real-life movie. This explains that cheeses work very often. Also, very often, the story becomes slightly mischievous and extravagant. I do not like how a few lines have been written and want to have more meaning for them. Although it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful and hip, it became boring, dry, distant and old. I hope nobody needs time to watch this movie because it would not be good not to see it.
