STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Mark *** This little bit in between ** Stopped behind * The Pits <br /> <br /> Some plutonium disappeared and some very ugly people now have the means to develop a bullet-capable bomb - Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his young protector Deke (Judson Mills, an actor different from the previous movie), with the help of Josh Que's adopted daughter Jennifer Tung) decided to stop them. It was another film that dealt with terrorism one year after the September 11 events. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself commented later, as soon as the plot of the film resembles what happened in downtown New York that day, so it would have been those who were in the mood for a movie in which Norris kicks a terrorist's ass if nothing else. Besides, it's as interchangeable as anything ever was in Norris. It makes you wonder what the original did to justify a sequel first, and if it could turn this man into a man of the president, he might soon be out. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've really seen it all and there's nothing new or unexpected that's going on with it, but at least you know what you get and like I said, it was supposed to be what they had to leave some steam. **
