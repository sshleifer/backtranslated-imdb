This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I'm watching all the original movies playing on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island seems quite familiar. What it was, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But this has the Sabertooth tigers in return. The film begins with a few college children stereotypes on an island that make a sort of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying in a rather terrible death, with some of the most serious special effects I've seen. The blood seemed very similar to ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many sword tooth tigers as people can enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and go around to eat tourists, or people invited to the island to see the first hand tigers. Again, it sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the best thing to do was the 1,000-pound sword tooth that dragged on the front legs, killing the crazy scientist with a tooth-piece that somehow gets together and passes through the neck of the men. The most funny death I've ever seen on TV. The act is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible. CG tigers could pass close to clay patterns and even some of the sounds were turned off. For example, when one of your colleagues tries to escape, he uses an ax to break a door, the ax comes into the door and after 2 seconds you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The death of the cheese was quite funny.
