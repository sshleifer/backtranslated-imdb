I shouted my head because I saw that this film was my first film experience that took place in about 13 months. I remember he was incredibly bloody and I was upset. I saw her again on TV a few years ago. Great mistake - the action is wooden, the intrigue does not exist and the film has no merit unless T & A is 23 years old ... 0 / ****
