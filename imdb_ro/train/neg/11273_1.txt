How can you glean this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with a bunch of film fertilizers? Horrible scenario, hectic annoying camera, great edited, horrified. Only Rhys Ifans is trying to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "different" is sometimes equal to "dreck". Why money can not read the scriptures in advance? Do yourself a favor: reward yourself and do something else - as if you hit a hammer on your knees. It's less painful and fun than this movie!
