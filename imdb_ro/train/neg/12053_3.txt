as always this is an inaccurate picture of homeless people. The TV said a lot of lies about the manuscripts of the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed that we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day were much closer of reality. when someone drove where I held a sign of offer to work, and gave me work, I actually went and got the job if I was physically able.and if he had offered it $ 100,000 id damned surely invested in in apt prepaid for less than 2 years and kept the most in the bank and yet I left $ 10-20000 for gambling $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 at casinos. I usually always win and could earn decent if I only had a bankroll. In return, earning about $ 1000 a month is all about minimal buying because you do not want to lose everything. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk spending my money and breaking it, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in my socks while I was sleeping outside. anyone wishing to speak sevencard2003 contact on yahoo messenger.i I admit that I was different from most homeless, though, because I never smoked or took drugs. I'm no longer home, I'm now in government housing with $ 177 a month, and I've got SSI and spent most of my time earning online poker. my mother and the diversified sunflower have worked hard to get my SSI. I'm glad my days to hide under the scene in the casino's convention center sleeping at night, worrying that I'm trapped in security are finally over. if this crew selected me to have been much earlier. is ashamed how I do not choose better who I choose.
