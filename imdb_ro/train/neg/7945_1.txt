The film confuses ethics and religious ideals so much that it fails to create a coherent argument against the death penalty at any level. Presenting the legal execution of a crime condemned as a catalyst for the end of apocalyptic mankind, the film raises a mother killer to Christ's martyrdom. In a way, according to the plot, the god is angry that society has chosen to get rid of a fanatic who has killed his own parents by burning them while sleeping unprotected in their beds. However, the same god has no indignation for the killer's deeds. The character of lead, a non-religious pregnant female suicide, ultimately gives its own life in a defiant but unnecessary attempt to unsuccessfully save this condemned killer. In other waves of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as a feeble and frustrated tramp to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes him, but also plays the messianic ideal of all religions. He is unable to affect mankind for good and non-emotional skates, the edges of life that expect mankind to destroy its self. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself in her new-born infant, who saves humanity from the Almighty wrath. We also interpreted it as a statement in support of abortion at some levels. This film, which tries to create many religious themes in a thriller, fails to make any religious point that I can interpret clearly, rather than mocking people's beliefs. There are many questions he does not even try to answer. It ignores the religious values ​​of its audience, trying to present an asian version of their fulfillment. dumbass
