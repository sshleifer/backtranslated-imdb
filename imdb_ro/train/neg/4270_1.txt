This is another incredible and non-sensual piece of Hollywood dreck. Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a business suit, likes me to be a better second baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard self and makes little to be a convincing victim. Every scene of this persuasion is absolutely predictable to the end when Kurt defends Ray with a vase or something, knocking down and out. Kurt and Madeline absolutely embrace the end of the film, and ALL - except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta will come back and threaten the couple again. , of course, and Russell forced him 10 times by 9mm, which was NECESSARY. This movie could end as well with the bludgeoning scene --- EXCEPT Hollywood dotes on useless violence, and the longer I can add, or "spore", the more slobbery they get.
