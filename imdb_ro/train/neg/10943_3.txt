This is a very bad movie with a bad attitude and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really nice. All the characters are just annoying (except the Lamas), and there is absolutely no one to rotate or take care of, plus the action is very dull. The film gives us three villains who should have found menacing and disturbing when they were actually boring, ridiculous and just a bunch of monsters I wanted to shut up! And it looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but can not save this piece of nonsense and thinks or not that the opening was really cool, just like the end, yet the middle is incredibly boring and gave me the desire to press the button fast forward!, plus Dialogue is especially ridiculous! There is a cold bar scene that I liked, but once Lamas heads to the dock, everything is breaking up, plus the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family and kill them should have considered it disturbing when, in fact , it's ridiculous! This is a very bad movie with a bad action and a very boring pace, but Lorenzo Lamas is very cool, yet it is not enough, it is not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very poor job here with a mediocre work of the room, a gentle location and keeping the movie boring. The actor is pretty bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great here, and although he has no obligation to act, it is fun enough to look, he has a very cool character and he has a lot of charisms, but he can not even save him and he a chemistry with distribution either! (The Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell's terrible here, and while he looks decent, he's not very convincing and has no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but she has nothing to do but scream and scare, she has done well. Robert Scott is INCREDIBLE annoying as the main villain, and was not at all threatening, he was ridiculous like the others. 2. The rest of the cast is bad. Generally avoid! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me). * of 5
