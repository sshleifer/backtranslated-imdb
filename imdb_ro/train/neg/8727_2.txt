Let me start by saying that I can enjoy almost any terrible Italian film or jungle explosion in the 1970s. Seriously. This was terrible. There are too many items that Martino is trying to inject, and none of them works well (except for crisp things). There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, who have created a jungle resort somewhere. I do not even remember where it happens ... how sad it is ... Practically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ceremonies, but eventually they upset the "Alligator God" of evil, who then continues to revenge, killing travelers and a few tribes. Sounds good, right? Well, do not make your hopes. There is minimal violence to the end, the special effects are as bad as a kindergarten class has done, and the story of love thrown is ridiculous. There are some serious scenes where they seem to have set an underwater camera in a pool and tossed a toy alligator like a dart in the water and should have attacked the gun. I'm not kidding. In another great, specially designed effect, a Matchbox wagon is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, which is suddenly five times larger than a wagon. (A few minutes ago, it was big enough for a man to eat, but now he's bored with a big deal ...) He's really pathetic. The only other move I can imagine where the effects that we have made of the story so bad was the masterpiece of Bruno Mattei, "Rats", what happens to plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all those who might NOT be horrified. /> <br /> Normally, I would say that whatever Sergio Martino was a solid must see, but this is a must-pass. Loss of time and undoubtedly worth buying for the price of $ 15 + sticker from no shame. This is a SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
