Some could say something like "Baby Geniuses" with his giant robot children or "Dumbo" with the drug-dependent psychedelic nightmare sequence would win the prize for the most disturbing film ever made for children. You could say that too, but you were wrong. Behold, here's what I'm bringing: Santa Claus, the most unfortunate family movie ever since ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> From opening scenes showing kids from different parts of the world singing their themed songs (seriously, this segment has almost 20 freakin 'long minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) to thrill a conclusion where Merlin appears from nowhere and saves the day (does not mind it, it is from Barcelona), this is childhood trauma at its best. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... get ... those ... laughter ... laughter ... from ... .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this piece of trash as if you were avoiding a sex hungry whale during the mating season. However, if gay demons flaming with a serious case of over-influenced flu are something for you, I think you should try. But really, this film is not worth the time and mental health.
