Before viewing this film, please check the internet commentary on the falsification of the film, especially about its rumors about the fact that 7-8 thousand Muslims were taken out of Srebrenica and shot by Serb paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian organizations. See this critical movie and read reviews beforehand. Most reviews claim that the documentary takes too many arguments, even if it raises questions about conventional wisdom about war. A review of NYTimes by Stephen Holden says it would be "inaccurate labeling of this pro-Serbian documentary," but questions should be posed as to the presentation of the facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, as well as the omission of these facts denounces the Serb forces. I do not advise not to see this documentary, but I warn you to examine it with a very critical eye (as you should anyway).
