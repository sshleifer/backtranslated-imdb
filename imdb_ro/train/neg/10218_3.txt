** Spoilers Contained ** <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that this movie was controversial and that the end was particularly horrible. What I did not expect was the complete change of the game with about twenty minutes to go. What begins as a typical Western cowboy falls suddenly in a very boring romantic comedy about Honus (the blue soldier of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), who escapes Cheyenne's cavalry attack. Most of the film then focuses on these two people who do not fit, and hence the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance returns and kidnaps them for no apparently real reason. They then escape and rise (separately) to the base of the cavalry on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base. As Cresta had been married to one of Cheyenne's bosses, she escaped from the base of the cavalry and joined them. Until now so ordinary. Then comes the end. After more than an hour of bad action involving a ratchet, they will not be along with the story, the movie then turns into top exploitation that involves, among other things, a behead and a child being shot behind his head. Similarities can be attracted to Wild Bunch at this time of the movie, but Wild Bunch kept the same tone and did not resort to extremely gratuitous violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which has also completely changed the point of view for an end of shock. I did not hate the blue soldier, nor did I find the ending disturbing ending, but I found it boring, with an endless use of violence. If you want to see a movie with a really bothering butchery of innocents, I would recommend Elem Klimov Come and see.
