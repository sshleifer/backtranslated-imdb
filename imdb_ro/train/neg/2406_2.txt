Some characters with the same name. just where the treasure is simply a chance. On the way, they encounter a strange assortment of extremely bladder monsters, take a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the queen of Phenicia, so ridiculous, it's a hohot. is the only reason I did not give it 1.
