This film masks as a social commentary, when it's just as ridiculous as the racism it condemns. The premise of this film: Afro-american = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport draws a weapon on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish type, stereotypically, collapses in fear and begins to plead for his life ... but the great, powerful, defiant Omar Epps is powerful, fearless. We also have the condemnation of each member of the fraternity as an arrogant or violating preponderance. The white raped girl, of course, starts to consider lesbianism, since she is just a poor white girl. When the miserable white guy is rejected by the fraternity, he must, of course, fall with the skin, which is incredible; especially the big muscle that is quickly beaten by powerful black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES WELL FOR A GUY TWO DIMENSION OF ??? Naturally, black men NEVER reject their own people, and Omar Epps moves easily with them. Situations in which Ice Cube threatens white-room colleagues and keep them in line are just fools - of course he is the dominant one, while his colleagues of weak white rooms are afraid of him and eventually move. This movie was terrible, and the ending made me laugh out loud. The long-lasting long-term movement between Epps and Banks becomes hilarious with the faces I make - it's like watching my nephew and cousin face each other (and everyone under 5). Do a favor and jump over this crapfest.
