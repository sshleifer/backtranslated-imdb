Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his supreme mastery on the sub-genre Mockumentary is not in difficulty to be supported in the slightest especially not by this extremely dysfunctional game of RPG gamers. The jokes are beyond the blades. The substance is not enough to last the typical SNL skit (especially the rancid), much less with the atrocious 87 minutes I've been watching. The great William Katt (The Biggest American Hero, The House) deserves much better. One thing and one thing makes the fact that I have seen this is worth it in my mind and that posting about it here, so hopefully, I hope I will save some such bad experience.
