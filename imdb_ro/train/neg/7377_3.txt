Even though the story was very detailed, and the story line was easy to understand that Steven Seagals's voice was doubled with someone else's, most of the movie was painful because you did not know who was talking. There were many places where he began to speak in his deep voice, and then the next voice of somebody else was talking to him. I do not know the reason, though, if he had difficulty expressing his voice during the production of the film, I think he could have resumed events that did not have his own voice when he recovered. We rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the movie. When someone pays for a movie whether they are at theater or DVD, this movie does not deserve the admission price that has been charged. I've been a long time watching Steven Seagal and all the movies he has done in recent years. So far I think this is one of the worst I've ever seen
