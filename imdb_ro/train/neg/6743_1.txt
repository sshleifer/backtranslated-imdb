How many times do we have to watch bad horror movies with a murderer in a Scream-ripoff mask? Bleed's land is quite original, but the film itself is a complete failure. For one thing, the dialogue is underdeveloped, it is boring and too much time is spent on banal details, the action is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rental laughs worse than a skunk.
