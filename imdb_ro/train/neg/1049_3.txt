This movie has a great Broadway feel - the background, the act, the "noise" - and yet that's all it has. Some "sense" of a Broadway without a bang. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, the image is split, the song "appears" to you, so you suddenly remember it as a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolebila: Sinatra's fianc√©e - surely the pitch and the emphasis of her voice were not necessary. Tolerable: Lord "I remember the numbers on my dice" Delight: Brando's undervalued song (very biased!) Surprise: how much does Jean Simmons look like Vivien Leigh in her scenes in Havana. It is the bone structure! How would I have killed seeing Miss Leigh in a role that once again challenged Brando.
