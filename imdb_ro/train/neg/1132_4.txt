The point of the far longer preparatory phase of this star is Born Story seems to be to make the ultimate success the more sublime. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a dark, dark woman inside her, but never convincing as a stage actress of rising fame that exceeds the profits of this detachment. Even in the long scenes of Esther's lessons of action, we never see her fulfill the instructions of the teacher. Having suffered through Esther's pain (largely self-provoked), in exorcising details, we are not given any persuasive sense of her triumph. The obsessive presence of heroin pain seems to be understood as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never meet in a coherent whole. A 163-minute, simple-story movie should be able to knit its free ends. Esther Kahn is not yet ready to go to an audience.
