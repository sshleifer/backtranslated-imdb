Once upon a time, some bad guys made a movie about a guy who was shot in space, supposed to go to Saturn, but really only on some of the solar rocket weapons films, and then get a nosebleed, and before you know, it sits in a bandaged head bandaged in the leg and then an assistant suffering from an excessive weight with an inadequate uniform comes in and eats the guy who should melt everywhere but does not seem to lose any meal, and then NASA, or at least one NASA guy, gets upset and calls on another guy to hunt him, but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy he has to go home and have soup first, and his strange wife forgot the biscuits, so he can not have biscuits, and then he has to go outside and look for the guy who melts with a geiger counter and it does not really work , so c it just follows the trail of half-eaten bodies, and then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly elders in a lemon forest, and a woman with a meat cleaver, some industrial plant with happy guards, and not I can tell you how the movies end, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with a guy named stupid by Burr DeBenning, and if there is any right in the world, everyone in this movie has died a hideous, violent death failed to make more movies and the world lived HAPPILY EVERY AFTER THE END!
