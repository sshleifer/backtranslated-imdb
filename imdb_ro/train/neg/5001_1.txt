I do not know why I comment on this reality-foolish reality as I watched a few episodes of (a cable marathon broadcast when they broadcast 5 episodes in a row or something, I did not look at the whole thing like three episodes) pregnant in nine months and is about to go into work every day. Maybe I feel bored today :-) I'm sorry for Britney, I really do. money and fame, seems to have a very little sense of dignity. She is selfish to the extreme. He married Federwin (whoever can make a mistake) and before that he "played" this horrible show about his daily life with him, where he pushes a video camera wherever he feels, whether in front of someone or in the shower , as Federline stands there. She gropes about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination, I do not care about my side, but I can not think how she feels now when she's divorced. And yes, for her sake, I feel embarrassed. But I should not be. It seems that he lives a rather empty, rather shallow life. I do not want to change lives with her, even if I can. Road-kill TV if you like.
