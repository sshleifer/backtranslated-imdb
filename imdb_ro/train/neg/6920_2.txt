Body Slam (1987) is a terrific flat film. The low budget returns, the direction is pedestrian (at best), and writing and driving are blades. But if you are in an old school struggle (about 1970 to the mid-1980s), then you will be more entertaining than the one who saw you. I have to warn you, this movie smells on the ice. I gave her two, because I felt generous. This turkey was "directed" by the master of the Hal Needham waterfall. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of ash fighters and actors in the clergy list (Dirk Benedict). The synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "rock hair" and fights. But they are others who do not want him to succeed. There are more, but I do not want you to tell her that. If you can stomach evil acting and unprecedented story, there are some surprises near the end for moral-wrestling fans hard. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my enemy worse (and I mean).
