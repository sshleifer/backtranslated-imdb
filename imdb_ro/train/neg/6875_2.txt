A kind of erotic scene just to realize that this was one of the most amazing and incredible bits of film I've ever seen. Kind of a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what happened to all those characters in that bizarre city supposed Midwest? Hard enough to get involved in this. No lesson to learn from it, no brilliant idea, just raised and ridiculous (but a lot of skin if you intrigue) registered nonsense ... What was with the bisexual relationship, nowhere after all the meetings heterosexual. And what was with this absurd dance, with each playing their stereotypical roles? Give it a pass, it's like a million miles of bad movie, lost, money that could have been spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa .....
