Write to all foolish scientists everywhere: If you are going to turn your son into a genetic mutter, you have to give him a more frightening name than Paul. I do not care if it's a frightening hammer shark, a dagger's sharp mouth, and the ability to ambush people both in water and on land. Give the child a worthy name such as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if she eats me, I'll probably just sit there laughing, "Ha! Take a bunch of that!" Paul Monster breaks me apart !!!!! "This is the worst part of the movie, this is referred to as" Paul "throughout the movie. It makes what could have been a terrible, awesome movie, it looks great. and contrived of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy." Scientists spend the whole movie wandering along this island and suddenly one of the girls starts to foolishly out of walking in the lush forest and just has to pouring water on his feet to resurrect the itch, which of course allows Paul to get out of the water and kill it. The only thing SciFI Channel did in this film was to leave hottie live. small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing film.
