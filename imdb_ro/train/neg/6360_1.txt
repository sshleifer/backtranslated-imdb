Can I ask you to return $ 13.00 back? Rather I would have watched "Hydro-electric energy comes to North America". Again. This is a movie with a voice. The same voice that comes out of every mouth, regardless of age or sex. To listen to that voice again, it should charge at least $ 150 per hour. And I do not get insurance. It was great that Will Ferrell turns into Woody. But I do not think imaginative distribution is enough. You have to wait until they have a story before they bother to make a movie. Only if it's just for the money. And if that's the case, why not just re-publish an All-Rap version of "What's Tiger Lily?"
