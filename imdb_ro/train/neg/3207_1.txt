My GOD was so bad! The story was poor - at best - and the animation was flat and lively - even childish. This movie takes too seriously ... unless, of course, they wanted to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival, and the whole audience laughed at each scene. I think my favorite was "you should not study medicine at Oopsalof"! I also think they were trying to see how many times they could have returned to Nicalo's character, "we'll be together ... it's our destiny." I'm sorry, but after the first time the words lost all meaning. And what was the apple? I recommend this as a lesson for Americans: You can not animate, so please do not try. You're kidding yourself.
