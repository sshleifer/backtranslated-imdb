This movie has the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was made decent and I felt sorry for him and it was a decent amount of backstory. However, anything else sucks. The director, Emmanuel, is quite incompetent to the film. He uses some of the most idiotic photographs over time. - Some random sequences of randomly scattered images throughout the movie. I do not know if he tried to be profound and intelligent and poetic, but it was not. It was bad. Random photos of the trailer where the main character lived, random buildings, random buildings pictures, random cats moving away. WTF? And clouds. A lot of dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - I really enjoyed this technique of having a cut scene in different shots instead of being just one continuous shot. EX: Guy tries to light the grass and the circular chamber around him. Instead of just one shot, he edits it in 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. The acting is horrible, but it's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast because he is spinning and rotating and twisting all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main battle to have a long death, but not too much. A simple corn in the ear. The interest of love was hot. Voluptuous. That's why this movie gets 2.
