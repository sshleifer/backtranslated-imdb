I tried to like this slash, as if I'm trying to enjoy all of Slasher's movies. I mean the murderless murder mixed with a little nudity and suspense, how can you be wrong. But, Unhinged thinks it's an example of that wicked formulation. The main problem is the horrific action of the main three girls who joined the house. It was as if she had been sedated and prevented me from ever wondering about their situation. The film follows suspense and humiliation, but the direction of numbers gives it away, and leaves the film pretty boring. It is a shame, because if the film were better executed, it would have been needles. The story and the characters are pretty scary and there are moments of interaction between the mother, the girl and the daughter of the old house. There is good nudity and occasional blood, which is not enough to give the movie a shot it needs. The end is quite twisted and frightening, and gives the movie a big lift, but unfortunately too little too late. So, in my opinion, you should be avoided if you do not really love tedious slasher movies. There is a fairly large amount of potential, but the film offers too little to deserve.
