I saw the movie tonight on a free preview preview, and despite the fact that I did not pay a penny to see this movie, I felt still broken. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you see this movie, leave a Benjamin on your chair. The actor is the best; Kiefer Sutherland phones in Jack Bauer's worst puns, and Michael Douglas seems to realize he made a bad choice from Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time he took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity entity; he seems to read his lines on a teleprompter. And if you can not see "mole" in the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet in a world without TV and recycled story lines. If you really want to see a good thriller, rent the fire. If you see and buy in this, you will start to fear the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like great versions like 90210. Regardless of your feelings about W, let's hope that this "art" does not imitate life.
