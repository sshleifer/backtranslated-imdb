Hell, I thought I saw bad West Indians. However, I can not put it in the forefront. Hell, I think I prefer to open my eyes closed for a triple Trinity feature to cry out loud. I do not think I can watch Ben Hur again without laughing. Very bad. But if you like starved Westerners with stars recognized in work, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but more fun. 1/10
