I rented this movie a month ago, when I had nothing else to do on Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is "TRASH" The actor is so badly done I've seen high school kids do a better job The whole castle seems to read only their lines, no sentiment, no emotion, and no room to capture the viewer. In another note, the special effects were crazy and everything seemed to have been shot with a room that anyone can buy a radio boat. The clown itself does not show anything like the one on the video cover. Heck, he does not even appear in the movie all the way to the noisy songs and goes around some characters. There is no actual crime presented so it is not a true movie Slasher or Since I've seen it I asked a few things 1. If it's "Serial Insane Clown Killer," would not it be a serial killer who kills clowns? 2. If your boyfriend loses why you go out into the woods to have sex rather than looking for her? Very sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is the only action REAL blown in vain at the end of the day? Finally, did the distribution decide to show their effort in their work? This movie is as sad as they are. My advice is to avoid renting it in order not to lose an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
