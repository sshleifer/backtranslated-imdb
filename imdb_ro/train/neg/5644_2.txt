What happened to the British drama? From John Major to Tony Blair, the focus of gender seems to have shifted from social realism to normative stories about women focusing on the inner problems of middle-class professionals. (Or maybe TVNZ no Do not buy good things? Please let it be what it is ...) The long career of the writer in the soap probably explains why the dialogue is formed largely from the old cliches. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong for a meaningful look, each director-in-chief for at least half a dozen bats more than deserves. Balkan views are, however, a weak substitute for the depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for the actors to work with. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is theoretically a thriller, about a murder investigation; but this is not as important as the marriage facing the central character and its associated problems. Is the character of Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will her son be completely traumatized by the separation of her marriage? Doing these central issues is not a sign of understanding - it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification of the writer and director, with a character who should get involved in her job. Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so that she feels like it is important and involves spectators, other than internal nevrosions; Clearly, Paula Milne is not pregnant.
