Beyond the fact that crazy people exist and there are religious nuts there. <br /> <br /> Characters have virtually no meaning for most of the time. The movie does not have a real, middle or too much explanation. The film opens with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, who seems to be returning from a stint in the army. <br /> <br /> He goes to a two-story house that is in a state of extreme despair, and the windows get on board. He enters the house, walks on and finally writes a note that he's leaving. This scene does nothing, and we do not see anything about the house or its history. It never explains exactly what that house is or where people have left, but we are given the impression that Hazel probably lived there at some point. Hazel decides to go to a city. Why - we do not know. Once she arrives in this city she writes a name and address she sees on a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat prostitute. He sees it for a while, and then apparently does not see her again. Like anything else in this movie, it does nothing and it has no purpose. A young man named Enoch tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is not interested, though he keeps crossing the paths. <br /> <br /> <br /> Enoch is about as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk insultingly. We never know why Enoch behaves the way he does or why Hazel behaves like him, beyond the fact that Hazel had an old, scary, fundamentalistic religion over his grandfather. Enoch later becomes excited by a man dressed in a gorilla suit and manages to get a gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it. Hazel, who is hurt enough tight and seems to be in a constant fury of the border makes a little street preaching. I have the impression that she is trying to get rid of the untruth of the religion that has been forced into him. He has several meetings with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never do, and there is no parcel line. Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins to self-wound. It's a very strange movie. Interesting about his weirdness, but besides the fact that he has absolutely nothing to go for him. Distribution has a remarkable job, but this film also fails to give any point of view or story. <Br> The movie also has the characters that are cast around the word N from time to time without any link to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
