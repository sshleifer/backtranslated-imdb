a documented action / manipulation of one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe place ... but sadly, a bunch of sex workers got to play in a soccer team assembled in what it looks like no more than a week! the main focus of the documentary is to prove that society rejects such "workers", even though no solution to these poor women has ever been achieved, except that the people who have documented this have made it a sort of "star" says that) in exchange for being exploited to make this reality a documentary. yet has its own documented reality ... but unfortunately has nothing to do with the main story. I would not accept to see it again; but I would recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
