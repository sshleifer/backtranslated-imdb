From my knowledge, the Largo was a Belgian Belgian comic (I never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a kind of James Bond without spy life! So when I had to choose a movie for a 5 year old baby, I took it because the baby was already a big fan of James Bond! But right after the opening of the credits, I have serious doubts: when the American films offer an amazing start, here, no action and a sexious scene of the horror? Then the story becomes very complicated with financial moves? I thought I lost my baby. But, strangely, it was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was Tomer Sisley's excellent interpretation? Largo's difficult relationship with his father? The story of several booths where friends are bad boys, bad guys are friends? Exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yugoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he really cares about Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
