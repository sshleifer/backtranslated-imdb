A scary, terrifying horrible (and not fun) C grade. Everything shouts "amateur," from the screaming scenario (bizarre spaces, limited coherence and predictable endings, turbid lighting, angles of the sound and hand camera, sexual incoherence and references, uncontrollable and uninterested dialogue at Z we saw it on DVD and I hope Edward Wood will come out, everything is forgiven - the worst films are art works and more coherent than those from this point of view. "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - are you sure the Titanic crew did not was he involved in this part of it?
