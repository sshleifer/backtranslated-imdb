I first read "Lorna Doone" 20 years ago and I absolutely enjoyed it! It is a classic historical story, established in the 1600s, when the West was a few days' walk from London, and the law and order were much harder to apply. Unfortunately, this version of the book has more freedoms with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. Act and production values ​​are fine, but the way the story was about was terrible. Why do TV adaptations do this? Why would he think the thousands of fans of the book would like to change the story? One of the greatest mysteries of life! The BBC made an excellent version that was broadcast at Christmas in the early 1990s, which I'm still trying to find in my copy! Take my advice, read the book and do not bother with this lying version!
