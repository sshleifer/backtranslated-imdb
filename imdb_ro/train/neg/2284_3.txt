Now, I will not deny that when I bought this eBay, I had big expectations. This was an incredible work outside the printing press from the comedy master I liked. However, I was soon disappointed. I apologize for those who liked it, but I just found Complete Al very hard to follow. I received some smiles, of course, but most of the fun came from the musical videos (which I received on DVD), and the rest was mainly filled. You might say that this was not Al's greatest achievement (this honor goes to the UHF). Honestly, I doubt if this will ever make the jump on DVD, so if you're Al's ultra-hard fan and you just have to own it all, buy the band on eBay. Do not pay too much for that.
