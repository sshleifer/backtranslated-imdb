An absolutely miserable loss of film! Nothing ever happens. There are no ghosts, no train, no mystery, no interest. Constant and Brutal attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stuck in the middle because their train was held for more than 3 minutes. What the? And the railways do not let them stay in a strong storm? I do not think. Oh, they can move four miles across the black fields. um, yes. Sure. Or they can force themselves on the railroad hospitality and can stay at the haunted station. A station that did not turn out to be anything other than the DEFECTIVE TABLE, completely without ghost, interest or plot. So terribly boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list !! aargh !!
