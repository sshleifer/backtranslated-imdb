Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for the crapfest "The House of 1000 Corpses," now I can rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulistic performances or the tribute scenario will lift the dead to the "House of the Seven Bodies", but anyway, a ghoul's groove comes from his plot (ha!), To kill blood lovers by doing a horror film former home! In Hell's House (I'm sorry, I do not remember the real name of the residence), a lot of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; Some, such as John Carradine, in the role of Arthur Lurch (whose small role ensures the valuable moments of the film), attributes it to the supernatural; film director John Ireland rejects him as superstitious hokum. The result is that "Satan's School for Girls" (captivating title, television productions, intriguing plot) crossed with "Children should not play with dead things" awakens the dead; the trouble is, it's not as fun or entertaining. "The House of the Seven Corpses" is dead in the first row and spends the rest of the 89 minutes passing through deadly rigor, pulling us along two pains ...
