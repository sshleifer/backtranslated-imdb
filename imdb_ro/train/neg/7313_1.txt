I lost 5.75 to see this terrible movie, so I just want to know a few things: What was the point where the dog was half divided at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do being divided into half. What was the point of pulling Karen into the warehouse, he had already completely infected his camera, could have blocked it where it was safer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why would sirens run around the forest, asking aliens to help him when he could have asked his relatives, the piggirl, to Does it lead to the hospital? do any of the characters bother to go to town to get help when things get hurt, are they really so lazy? Even if Paul was threatened by the gunman to look at his wife, Paul could have sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the little girl he loves is deteriorating. What was the point of the box? Why did Jeff go to the cabin after he left when everyone else stood up, if he was so big a bastard to go first he would not be back home? If the police went to all the troubles of gathering the children and burning them in the pit, why they threw Paul half way into the river, it was not even necessary for the parcel because the water was already contaminated. Whoever makes lemonade from the river water, that carp has dirt and bugs in it. Why the two kids could not just use tap water, it was contaminated, so the stupid end would work.
