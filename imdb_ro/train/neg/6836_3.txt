Please, even if you're in the worst case, do not look at this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> I do not think there was anything right with this movie. After the recommendation of a friend, I followed this and literally washed 1h and 48 minutes of my life in the closet. Bad direction, bad direction, weak sequences and pathetic action sequences - and when you mix it, you get "double impact". Even the least expectations have not been met. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing - Never look at Van Damme's action shootings. It's a waste of time!
