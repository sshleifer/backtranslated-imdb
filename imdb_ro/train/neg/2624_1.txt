Let's say this smelling film would be insulted for skunks. As the other commentator says, this film is insulting to anyone aged 7 (it is, especially, incredibly insulting to gays). It's terrible - and not in a kind of "so bad it's funny" either - it's just terrible. No, I have to say this: STINKS! (sounds bad). From opening credits to final titles, there are only 10 seconds of this movie that deserves to open your eyes. "Crying" is incoherent, non-existent characterization, the action is above top toppling "look at me I am funny!" school and so on. The recordings are broken (if not at all) and are badly executed, it's terrible on all fronts - besides music, maybe I do not remember thinking the muttered music (apart from the songs). <br /> <br /> In order to be correct with the decision-makers, they place their books on the table quite quickly: opening credits also include the title "It also plays Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty Meteor" (since the meteorologist in question proves never to say anything but to make an occasional noise, she could simply have picked up Mrs. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the film has something like: ".. and the scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus. "Uranus -" Your anus "is geddit? geddit? is not it? is not it? Your anus? humor is really cheap. strange about the "comedies" of that period, in the sense that it was perfectly acceptable for the hero to deliberately shoot dead people on the street but not to say "sh *" We paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel ruined.
