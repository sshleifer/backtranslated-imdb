* The review may contain predictable spoilers, campy, bad effects. has a sense of TV movie. the idea of ​​the UN being taken over by Satan is an interesting turn for the end of the world, according to the Bible. the premise is exciting, but its excuses decrease shortly. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, at least make it a quality! I control my watch seriously while watching this. I can not say anything else about this movie ever since I saw it a year ago, and there's not much to say about this movie than ..... to jump on it!
