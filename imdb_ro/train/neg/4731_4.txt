A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley to this day, despite a sexy shower scene and a subplot of the pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old boy with clips of clips. A woman chooses E.P. on the beach and then continues to take over his life - and does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is defeated in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try hard as the two Elvis chiefs (seen from the moon). Some songs are pretty good, especially "almost in love," but if you want to see a more slim, wipe-up, updated Elvis sex comedy - show up elsewhere. When Elvis and his fatal attraction get to bed, there is a wooden plate between them! Be real. ** from ****
