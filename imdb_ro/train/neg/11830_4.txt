OK, maybe a 13-year-old like me was a little older for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat who lives in a palace. Then, a sewer rat hits it on a toilet! He gets into this rat town and meets the rat that has a jewel that a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this jewel he sends a whole army after these two rats. He intends to take the jewelery and swallow the city of the rats! Cool part of this movie. They make all the sound effects. They sing, make noisy, wonderful, also quite funny. The bottom line of the line is intended for 7 year olds. Another, wise, a great movie to take a smaller member of the family to see. I did not think animation was a real dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey left that a little. The film was just decent, it's not worth spending $ 9.50 because, though, I'm sorry.
