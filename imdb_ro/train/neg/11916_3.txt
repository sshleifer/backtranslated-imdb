Yuck. I thought weird that their ancient book about curses was made using a common script font instead of writing. The actress is so apathetic and sometimes so dramatic in other times. Why would a "demon" kill the two suspected quiet doctors who helped him immortal? Just for hell? And it's really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever he's out somewhere. I took! You spent some money renting a rocket with your third leg. It does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith" strip looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school, with a few last-minute changes. There is a scene in which some people are present at a talk show about 30 seconds before being killed for no apparent and irrelevant reason. Everybody is a throwing character. Forgotten characters and an even more forgotten plot make this film one of the worstly conceived films I've seen on the SciFi channel. Stay away if you're not in bad movies.
