Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) judged for her life. Because the faithful dog sleeps on his master's grave, he must be killed, according to the law. Oddly, it also explains that Lassie has no "legal" owner, which also seems against an old Scottish law. If, after three days, there is no owner, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (John Traill) pleads for Lassie's case, which leads to an extensive retrospection that shows Lassie's adoption by Donald Crisp (John "Jock" Gray). Although based on an interesting and original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), Challenge to Lassie revises several previous Lassie situations; and, it does not improve on them. From a comparative point of view, this is negligent and inexplicable; and, is a disappointing follow-up to "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and some of the other performers might be charming, but I can not pick it up. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is among the notable children supporting Lassie; much later, he will grow to marry "Dark Shadows," with an "Angelique" story (Lara Parker).
