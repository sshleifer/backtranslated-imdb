Some movies you pick up for a pound have proven to be pretty good - 23rd century movies have released dozens of obscene Italian and American films that have been great, but although Hardgore has released some Fulci movies, among others, most of their production is Zombie Chronicles carp. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not nearly as annoying as the Master of Flesh. Besides, it is a very heavy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a cock. It has been remarked elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that introduces previews of the action in its credit sequence so that until you reach the zombie attacks, you've already seen it all. Wicked film fans will have a ball looking at 18,000 mistakes and the devil (especially the hitchhike that was so bad that made me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore to get into the spirit of things through releasing a so bad print that it felt like watching a camping trip home. <br /> <br /> Great work, terrible. I did all this stuff when I took a camera, but the common sense prevails and these movies are somewhere in our closets. Avoid.
