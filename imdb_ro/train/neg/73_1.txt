This must be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while. Heath Ledger is a heart? It looked deformed. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts were an element in real life because I spent two of the longest hours of my life wondering what he saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a heart? With the deaf beard and deer in the light of the headlights forget about it, I can not say I agree. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous, but Geoffrey Rush looked like she could not wait to get out of the set. <br /> <br /> Should I be sorry for bankers and criminals? This is a cry far from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a fun movie. This was lived, knocked and boring. We only stay because we are convinced that it will improve. She did not. The last 10-15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his band are locked in a border hotel, and women and children die of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they left the hotel with the armor, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I waited for them to say, "I will bite your feet!" We laugh, like other wounded members of the audience. When I left, everyone was talking about what a waste of time this movie was. I probably did not pay for seeing this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never come back.
