Karl Jr and his father are now leading an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of boys who stumble on the island. Who after a while fought back. (and survivors) This man has blood, gore and carnage non-stop, which would have been good if one of them were viewed from a distance or if the production did not show that it was made for a week worth saving money I might be over-exported there, probably only a few days worth of). The terrible dubbing did not bother me so much and I suspect that if I were really drunk, some of them might have been a little humor ... maybe. But as it is, just 78 minutes the movie felt too long ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Extras DVD: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Pestilence Extreme"; and Trailers for other movies released by Shock-o-Rama
