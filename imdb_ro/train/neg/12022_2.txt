The idea of ​​the story is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution leaves it down. The film has no rhythm for one thing. It should be an exciting walk, but it's slower and more boring. I think the problem is mainly in scenario and editing. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to awaken suspense, and there are scenes that do not really move the story over very effective. Manufacturers should have seen this in the scenario and insisted on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is both the writer and the director, this will not happen clearly. Much of the act seems rather flat, and the director - all the actors were quite competent in other projects. It's a shame, because with better writing, editing and direction, this could have been a very good thriller.
