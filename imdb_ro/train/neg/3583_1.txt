If there was a scale less than 1, he would have received -10, following Godspell's footsteps. The actor (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, crying hesitantly. And Rene Russo was sweet in her role, enough to make a mad person. Ten fingers for a bad movie. Salvation of grace: kudos for the costuming of the era.
