Sequels have a bad habit of being disappointing and the best credit I can give is that it keeps that old tradition. These three stories are not as good as any of the original Creepshow. By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol coming to life to avenge the bullies who killed the owners. The second story is about a monster of lake, which seems to be but a lot of floating birds, makes you wonder how one might fear it. The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver, but besides, this is a pretty unimaginable story about the victim of a road accident that returns from the dead to the person who knocked him down. <br /> Follow the original Creepshow, or, if you have already done so, be happy with this.
