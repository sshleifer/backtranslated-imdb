Lolita is a rebel and she will share our eyes with open-ended sex stories, between sci-fi and fantasy ... Well, this Surrender Cinema production is not very good: a very bad action, terrible music and a line of story without any story and any line. But sex scenes are pretty well done, many lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, give us a very good and very hot show. Lovell fans only.
