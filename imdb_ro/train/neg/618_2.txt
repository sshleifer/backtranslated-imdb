Perhaps one of the most serious teenage movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points of the film, which covers almost the entire movie. First of all, something can not be avoided: THERAPY ACTION. I swear they took some random children on the street based on the way they looked. Second, the BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER features / disadvantage. You really do not even know half the children who are killed here. All you think is that they deserved it one way or the other. The character of the scarecrow has been overstretched and cheaply destroying the other fantasy killers, such as Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: Scarecrow was full of horrible narcissism that would make you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines such as "Let's go find some small animals to torture!" it even leaves you with a high eyebrow. Last but not least: the following option: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of the head was pungent for God's sake. There is much more about this movie, such as cheap special effects, it's about a "high-school class movie," but the point is understood. It's just a bad movie that does the worst thing. What about what we found to be "good" in the film: -Intervention for those with low, low, low-low standards -He needs to help insomniacs to sleep. - A very cheap laugh or even a chick.
