From terrible dead scenes to guns that trigger without sounding a character called Fiend. It's all tiring, slow, misunderstood. It was good to see the guy with his head and the cock hiding around. From a visual point of view, it was creepy and probably occupied by the time engineer, but even in 1936, someone would have thought there would have been some more imagination and verisimilitude even of a movie like this. I just waited for something of major importance to happen, as people were around them, making speeches and acting as if they were pointing to an office picnic. And then there are the bullets mentioned by the previous commentator. Perhaps the best clue would be to look for a water spot on someone's pocket.
