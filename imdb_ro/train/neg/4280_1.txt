This must be accompanied by a special note and a warning: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL PEOPLE. Obsession of Daneliuc with the dirtiest body functions becomes a real nightmare. It is also obvious that man is a misantrope, he hates everyone - his country - the people, the actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and forgets the profession he has known for a long time. This so-called "movie" is just a series of disgusting images, no artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
