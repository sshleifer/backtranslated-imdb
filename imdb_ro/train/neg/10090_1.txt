This movie is a joke. That's a funny joke "ha ha". Why? Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh we had against the absurd absurdity of a nonsensical, angry and horrific plot. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions in this movie ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie "caregivers" and what is their purpose? Since when 6 people become a "nation" of zombies? And is rusty black mascara eye "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a child of 2 years? Why was this movie made? Why? Why? Why? No answer? That's what I thought. On the request channel they have released this commentary after the film's synopsis: We apologize for this movie in advance "LOL. At least they had the decency to do that much!
