This is really a strange movie ... First of all, we have an ex-American gymnast trying to turn the actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever had (which I know anyway) - and for good reason. While he takes the role well enough to keep a certain interest, it is a pretty gentle and flat performance. Secondly, we have older sound effects ever used in a movie! I'm not kidding. This makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe And, thirdly, while we have a generally decent appearance acting as an interpreter (including the hot hot chick!), a fact not so bad and some cold visions; dialogue, battlegrounds involving gymnastics (hilarious!) and general execution of the plot are weak. This movie would have been much better than a network television movie (too bad Fox was not around in 1985). It is one of those movies that is simply bad, yet you can not resist watching and even enjoy it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal perfect house on television and the late night cables.
