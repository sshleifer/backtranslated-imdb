Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master thief who is forced to return to "play" when his younger brother is facing death for not completing an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The job involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will impose his punishment. So Raines quickly assembles a team he can trust and sets his task to handle. But the police are on it, and some of the cars on the list are not easy to take. It seems like a place almost impossible to implement. She has a pretty good cast in 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone deserves better. There are horses that act there to propel a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that there are too many cars out of the car park, the characters of many, lack of dowry. Unfortunately, we have no doubt that it is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a stuttering script, with loud noises and tattoos, scattergun, and slimmed down by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a remarkable remake of the H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie film of the same name, assuming the potential for an adrenaline movie based on the car. The potential that, unfortunately, is never realized. There are one or two moments of impact, certainly, but not at all. But if you forgive the game, the movie never comes out of the first stage, it is much more content to work with a lot of characters trying to try to make the hard scenario (Scott Rosenberg) work. <br /> <br /> The car fans will get something from it (cars are on the eye), just like fans of unintentional comedy films {check the time of Ecclestone carpenter's trouble}. But no, he is quite poor. 4/10
