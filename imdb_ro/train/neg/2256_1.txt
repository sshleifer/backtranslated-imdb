I'll admit I've seen maybe five minutes of "Jerry Springer." I do not consider myself a snob, but I think I look up to what's on his show. You should try to raise yourself over this too. I have seen this film as part of a social education event I run. I was told that this film had little to do with Springer himself, rather centered on the life of those who appeared on Springer. Handled better, this movie might have been a fascinating look at the fact that the lives of these people are pathetic. I will recognize that I felt an empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all he has in his life. How sad he feels he must go to Jerry's show to solve this. I'm really sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this. Did you notice that, after this movie, she was mainly relegated to the roles of "B" on TV? I'll say that about Hagan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very sincere in acting and tries to play the roles with much empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not have a scene on his own. It simply has nothing to do to have a leading role. The best work will always be Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place) and when he was guided to "Seinfeld" as sister Roberta.
