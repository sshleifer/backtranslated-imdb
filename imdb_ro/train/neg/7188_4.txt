When I saw the title, I thought of another hip hit, but actually I found "7eventy 5ive" to be a light pass and almost 80s after a middle section, momentum for the last half hour that leads at the brilliant apogee and at the end of the police. It will not win prizes for originality, because it is as systematic as you can steal your nerve in the way of excitement (usually cheap looting), location (retreat manor) and motivation from other movies. The brilliant direction is de-a-carte and the material is thoroughly cleaned with badly made red herring in its elaborate and brilliant design. Sometimes ridiculous, but I was mainly distracted by his brutal and aggressive acts of embarrassing violence against some rather annoying students by a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The shows were not bad in the form of a young casting casting, yet the characters they portrayed were not particularly enthusiastic. A Rutger Hauer, always presented, shows up in a short supporting role as a grizzled detective. A slickly addition, but a small and forgetful fold.
