Anyone who said that it is better than the Hostel speaks completely, you think I'm not a fan of the Hostel, but this is just ridiculous. This is just another chance on the video camera, directly to the DVD, the loss of lost ideas from your time, I can not believe how many of these movies exist and I'll see another decent one. In the 1980s horror and horror films were made with no budget, but with a great story and a lot of new ideas, and especially with the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they seem to be pumped in an attempt to trick people who sail into Blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing that, then I think these movies will continue to appear. This movie is so low on the ideas it is amazing as it has ever been done, the action is also terrible, the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying she demanded faith. This waste of time has absolutely nothing for her if you are not looking to compile a list of the most serious movies of all time. The best / worst part of the movie is when a female character indicates a weapon to someone and threatens to shoot them if he does not return, you see that he does not even cover the trigger with his finger, grip. An absolute joke.
