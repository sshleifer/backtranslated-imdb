I remember I loved this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the hottest thing I saw. It was ultra-high tech for the right time. He could reject enemy fire, make all kinds of acrobatics in the air, and take almost anything in his own way. Now I come back and watch today and am surprised at how bad this show is. Tower members are hard to constrain, there are plenty of moments of cheese, and battle scenes are incredibly fake. And almost at each end he has the same helicopter fighting nonsense with the obvious reuse of inferior quality lower quality material. Many of the images appear until the war in Vietnam. Airwolf has essentially the same theme as the Knight Rider, except that the crime vehicle is a helicopter instead of a car. After seeing a few episodes, I found myself totally bored. However, I love thematic music.
