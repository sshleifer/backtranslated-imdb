My girlfriend once brought the Zombie Chronicle for us to see it as a joke. Little did we realize that the joke was on her because she paid 1 pound for her. As I watched this movie, I started to come up with things I would rather than watch Zombie Chronicles. They included: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1) Bleaching alcohol 2) Mixing sand into the eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Reintroduction of American Civil War 5) Tax declarations 6) GCSE Mathematics 7) with an old lady. Garrett Clancy, alias Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was hit a door down (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never a movie has had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left him here, so now I live with the shame of having this piece of nonsense. News Just In: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to commit suicide. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE
