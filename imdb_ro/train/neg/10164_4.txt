I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival and I can not quite decide about it. We were never allowed to get close to any of the characters who cared about them. Maybe it was about being in a "balloon" of ours, but these people did not force me to worry or be shocked by their different destiny. At an operating time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was devoted to factory equipment pictures (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and baby dolls, confidently scary, with surprisingly realistic eyes, that most of the characters made to be alive were somewhat more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but in a way never happened.
