"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to be taking place in a world without a time, a long epoch, where the greatest sin a child might do is defy the law and get a ticket. It opens with a young female feminine fan, getting the business from its rival bow that presses it in a car race. It's about love-racing - this B movie is most concerned about rock 'n roll, man! People at American International were obviously in love with decent teenagers, who enjoyed attending and still did not disturb an adult chaperone. There are some fun double entenders and fruit shifts (Necking Kid: "I thought we would go out for fresh air ..." Father: "Where did you think you'll find her on her neck?") But the ghost is a little late on arrival . Briefly at 65 minutes, the movie deceives us with a climatic machine race that actually takes off the screen and a "Scooby Doo" show that does not make sense. However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** from ****
