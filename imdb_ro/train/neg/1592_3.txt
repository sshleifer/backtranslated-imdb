To emphasize the drama of this story from the maternity hospital, she is in a special room for "difficult cases". The main story is Loretta Young; she is away from a long prison sentence for murder. Doctors will save her child at the cost of her life, or will they consider her husband's reasons for the opposite? The melodrama and the feeling are dominant and they are not the most honest. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psychiatric room next to the maternity ward and allows a woman with a hysterical task to wander about kidnapping the children. There is plenty of laughter and sarcasm for this film to be recognized as a Warners film, especially by Glenda Farrell, who sings gin from her warm glass bottle while waiting to have twins that find out that there is a hurricane a law against the sale. An example of her reprobate: "Be attentive." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is, of course, a great authority as the primary health care provider, but do not expect to be given a dramatic moment. The main theme of the film is that the sight of a child turns anyone to eat. Even due to obvious limitations, this movie should have been better than it is.
