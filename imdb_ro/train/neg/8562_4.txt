A Love Love (Alexandre Dumas "La Dame aux Camelias") to scriptwriter Michael DeForrest and directed by a French talent by Radley Metzger who, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of the "Adult" cinema during the 60s and 70s. Using the domain format for the last time in his career, the exploration of "dolce vita" metzger is rich in visual excess (notes the focus on reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual motivation of the film seems alarming to modern standards. Production values ​​are enjoyable throughout the course, and performances are engaging and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite doubling post-synchronization. Although in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's drawings, which have been unleashed, firmly locate the film in his era, and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" music score has become a cult item among the devotees of the holding. Finally, CAMILLE 2000 is a taste, but fans of the elegant erotic softcore of this director will not be disappointed. The next for Metzger was THE QUARTER OF LICENSE (1970), which many consider to be the best film.
