What a lively view these television people have, taking their watch in their careers, which prevents a small piece of rust from a ship, might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and weak, and is not helped by a "big name" star, who barely succeeds in spitting a few lines he has given in a credible manner. supporting the casting over the material; they clearly see the clock here. Expand the scenes, check the check, go home and try to forget everything. It is not very expensive or filmed; there are no real clangers, it is just anodine, and it was shot in a very limited number of crowded sets with a small variety of extras. Pacing is a bit bizarre; a embarrassing, romantic sub-parcel began only after the main action began, which made him feel irrelevant. Maiden Voyage scores a few points to be competent and to be a fun game of "onsite kiwi kits"; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this movie probably represents their great break.
