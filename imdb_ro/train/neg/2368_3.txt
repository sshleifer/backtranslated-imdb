Okay, this is bad, they say they do not make another nightmare, it's "the last" ... And what do they do? He continues to do another, not that the next (part 7) was BAD, but why he is playing us. However, this movie did not make sense, it was extremely boring, the characters were very dimensional, Freddy was another joker who was really stupid for such a good series. Crying is very, very bad, and this is even worse than Part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, a stupid story in 3-D, worthless! I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts I did not like, which were essentially the entire movie. This is so different from prequels, try and try but it tried the hardest and she was back on her face. Besides these, there were scenes of death, although they were different, they survived. How can they go so far they did not see they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5, but did they do that? /> I have a NIGHTMARE on ELM SIX (6) 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: It had potential with plot. GOOD POINTS OF THE FILM: Terrible acts / lack of death / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
