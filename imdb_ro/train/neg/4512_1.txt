After lived in Japan for a few years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even come close to explaining what Geisha means. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring Japanese culture a little closer to the wider public and to help demystify the country where Zen, the Samurai, the Kyoto geyser world originate. Some of the film's worst moments are when Americans are shown in the Japanese environment. The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was not much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: the correct use of incense sticks has never been seen. The Sakura scenes were almost careless kitsch! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese people.
