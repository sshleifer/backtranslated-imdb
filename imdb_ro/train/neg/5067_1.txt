It's pretty simple. Friends is a very basic humorous comedy directed at adolescents and young adults with a sense of humor. It is also obvious that, in the end, they are desperately trying to make the last 10 seasons, most likely, so they could say they beat the Seinfeld season of 9 runs. The problem with this is that Seinfeld had 9 stunning seasons, with great writing, friends had (and are very generous here) at most 5 or 6 seasons OK and then 4 seasons. <br /> <br /> It has become a recycled humor soap opera and features of recycled characters that were not so good as to begin, then worsened the 100th time you saw them. It seems so hard to understand why people miss so much. It's really terrible.
