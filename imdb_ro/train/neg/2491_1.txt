Maiden Voyage is just that. I'd like to say right away that I looked at it five minutes before I could not bear it. As already stated in another comment, this film does not fit into the whole thing "so bad is good", it's just bad. The actor is terrible, the sfx is poor, and the story is mild and bad. Even the supplements suck, "the guards of the bags," and so it seems to keep their weapons as well as water guns. You do not even bother to watch this movie, the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are, you will be disappointed.
