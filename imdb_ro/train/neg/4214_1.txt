After I lost only a few hours watching this and for 80% of that time in full confidence, I can give this garbage to the turkey of the year without any problems. Saying that the plot was unbelievable is a great understatement. Frankly, I lost my words to describe this total farce. Not only are the characters completely and completely without any similarity of originality (this kind of thing was done much better in dozens of serial crime films), but the act was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who have been paid to do so, I hope you give your money back. Believe me there are many new shows that are much, much better. Go see it.
