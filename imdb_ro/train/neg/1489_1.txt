This started bad, it got worse, and until the girl attacked the old lady at the end, I literally wanted to take the DVD of the person we borrowed and smear the C ** T with death. Avoid this movie, a bit of good cinema and some bare shots, would be almost acceptable if I was 14 years old and I did not see Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I would recommend spending your time more appropriately, as an example, I would say that trying to squeeze a Lego house into your vagabond without lubrication would be a good start. I hear this movie was not the original, I would really like to see the original, because it looks like this cut version is devoid of all the plot, and it seems most of the nudity, can anyone please me telling how I can get in touch with Christian Viel gave me an hour of my life back!
