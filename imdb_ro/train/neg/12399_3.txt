The supernatural, revenge police agent returned to a third installment, this time acting as a guardian angel for a female police officer who was wrongly accused. The standard image and strain, but well-worked and straightened, making it strangely interesting and traceable, although violence is not for squeamish (especially cutting the director who originally received a rating of "NC-17"). > <br /> * 1/2 of ****
