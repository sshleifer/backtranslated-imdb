What a long, drawn and useless film. I'm sure, historically, this movie is delightful, but as fun goes, it just does not make the class. Ralph Fiennes was in some fantastic movies, the English patient, Schindler's list, but it was a kind of disappointment. It did not seem to go anywhere, its character from the beginning was so superficial and unwavering that I was surprised that his sister had never been interested at all. Do not bother paying for renting this movie, instead buy a copy of the English patient.
