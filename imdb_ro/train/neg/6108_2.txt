Tarzan, the monkey man, is a remake of the 1932 film at the same time, and as in the previous film, it does not look much like Burroughs' literary character. But while Tarzan in 1932 was reduced to the "Tarzan-Jane" discourse, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not even speak to eat. He makes the Tarzan cake several times, which seems to have been taken from the previous movie. No, Tarzan plays the second banana at Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather, like the third banana on Bo Derek's left chest and right chest. This movie has no point in showing that Derek is naked. The two action scenes in the movie are shown in slow motion and are very bad. More evidence that nobody cared. Oddly enough, Tarzan has an orangutan side shot in this movie. Perhaps the car has gathered from Sumatra with Indian elephants who are also exposed.
