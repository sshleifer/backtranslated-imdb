Every new autumn show deserves, at least, my "3 strikes and you're out" policy. Give a chance to 3 comedies to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After Episode 1, I actually said the TV: "Canceled tomorrow." It was so bad. I watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and I still managed to do it. It's not a titrate, a buzz, a chort, in fact, no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode, as I am convinced that this show is clearly missing. I just do not get it, but I think a comedy on a major television network in the first place just needs to be fun; but they're not laughing at me. There's no way ABC can make the funniest comedy of all time at 20:00. I know it must be a joke inside that does not just eat with my brain. I read each of the previous comments, I "have" the social aspect of it, but where are the Jokes ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a moment with the light of the bulb and will beat me in the head by shouting "Eureka".
