I should have said I read the manga and therefore my arguments are based on the differences. This anime disappointed me a lot because it eliminated the comedy and high quality action of manga and OVA. What left behind was only a shell of what it could have been. Many of the characters did not have the depth seen in the manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character who secretly wants death. Walter's story has no treachery. And the Nazi evildoers who act to swallow the world at war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides indignant Gary Stu Incognito, which is defeated by what seems to be a chance. My main complaint is not that the anime deviates from the manga, but it does so badly.
