This waste of scrap for television is the only piece of garbage in the world that has ever hit Australian television. Home colleagues are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent, and are chosen on the grounds that you will probably try to kill them if you should live with them. As far as I'm concerned, Big Brother is the decline of Western society, showing how we as a society are on a steep slope, becoming dead Christian monsters. What happened to the television that did not target the smallest common denominator of the audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Ten Channel can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who once was a respectable comedian, and once he moved to Channel 10, he became terribly unpleasant. Except The Simpsons, who is very smart.
