The film begins in Japan in 1840, when a man crushes his wife and boyfriend to death and suicides. It's a very bloody and bloody sequence. Then it jumps to this day ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying child move to Japan for his hubby work. They rent a house and - surprise! surprise - it's going to be the house where the crimes took place! The three dead are around the ghosts (makeup is hysterical bad) and make the hell life for the family. Sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and it ends and nothing happens between them. There is a giant crab attack that is just ugly! They looked so fake - I swear I saw the strings pulling one along - and they murmured !!!!! There is an unnecessary sexual sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but necessary for the plot) and a really stupid exorcism to the end. The battle scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen as credible. As for the actor - Albert was okay that the husband and McClure was good enough as a family friend. But George - as always - is awesome in a terrible movie. It gives this film a very necessary climb - but it can not save it. I give this only 2 for her and the opening and closing of my mouth. Besides, it's a very boring film.
