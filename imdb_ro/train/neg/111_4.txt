My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although there were big actors / actresses, there were only too many subplots that kept their interest. Plus it was not that exciting. The dialogue was rigid and confusing, and the story overturned too much to be credible. I was rather disappointed with what I think was one of Audrey Hepburn's latest movies. I always love John Ritter best in chocolate. It was too pathetic here.
