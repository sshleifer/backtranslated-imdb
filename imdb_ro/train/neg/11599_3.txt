The only thing that prevented this blow from being a total disaster was a pair of exciting and stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderated Spoiler Alert) Comic death is a bit derived from a scene in Twilight Zone: The movie that offers cartoon death. However, this was handled nicely, especially when we were looking at ink and the color being dug out. In addition, there is another good scene with a demon motorcycle. I was glad I got the cheap DVD at a store that was out of the business, because it was pretty awful. I've also bought "Soul Survivors," and both of the movies were just as annoying with the constant achievements you've been pursuing. However, if "Soul Survivors" have nothing to redeem or have any meaning, this has had at least some elegant notes, mentioned above. Interestingly, the DVD lets you go to the 8 nightmares where something happens, which is the only way to track it. The scenario between the creative moments of the gore is quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
