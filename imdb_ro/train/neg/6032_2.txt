I am a Christian who generally believes in theology learned in the Left Behind. Having said that, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. To have a good movie, you need to have a well written script. The left behind fell very little on this. First, it deviates radically from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel to a two-hour film, but in this movie I saw changes that made no sense. Another thing is the zero development of the character. When the characters in the story are saved (I will not tell who), the book clarifies that it is a long, soul-searching process. The film is fast and artificial. The book is quite decent where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but movie scenarios are consistently given a quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where a character is angry to be left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. I realize that a Christian is inappropriate to say that I did not like this movie, but I can not, in good conscience, recommend a movie that I think was terrible. Perhaps it would have been better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. However, Christians must realize that, to be taken seriously as film producers, we must begin by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize that a lot of effort probably went to the Left Behind, but I see it.
