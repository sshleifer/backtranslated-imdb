But I got over that. For me, it seemed that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I'm sorry for the character Louise and she was constantly compared to Esau, which was bad, I felt the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Indeed, the movie was bad. I would not really see it unless you're ready for great disappointment.
