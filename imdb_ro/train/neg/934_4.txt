Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Ritter was not bad either. What was her name as beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. For the sake, the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, tribute and boring. From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was presented as a child's paint by routine numbers. The characters were cut pieces of cardboard. There was nothing new or exciting to say, and it totally exceeded the act, which was a sin. Finally, the writer of scripts too bad was not the victim. Especially with the "early" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable. Again, just the act prevented a much lower score.
