Before writing this review, I went back and read the reviews of others. This movie was a special disappointment for me, as two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, enjoy a score of the often wonderful Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "The Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair. "The dance was crushed, unmotivated and uninhabited, the songs forgot, a joke, and even the costume was not particularly flattering, only the photo captured the right mood and spirit. - enjoyed the "Young girls in Rochefort," though I certainly did not.
