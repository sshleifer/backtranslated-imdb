This could be seen in many different ways. This movie is shit, good or just strange. The third one probably explains this movie best. He has strange themes and has a strange plot. So who else than Christopher Walken would play in this game, no matter how bad, medium or even how good it might be. The actor was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black always liked me, so you know what you're going to get out of, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always on the wall. He is always pleased to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Wise comedy is somewhat funny. This, of course, means that he has his moments (though very few), but he can get a little over the top here and there, which makes me feel like the movie is desperate to laugh, but of course not in a good way. <br /> The direction was also average. Barry Levinson is a little overestimated director and really did not do a good job here. This movie seemed to have much more potential and did not do much to get to it. Only very average and did not seem to have made a great effort in making this film. Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously, that means writing failed. At best it is below average. Given that his moments were not too horrible. It's never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and it ends stupidly ridiculous, I would have given her a lower rating. He is always a character in his films. Style is just a strange, strange movie with strange characters that do not work at all. It's not totally horrible, but I would not really recommend, though because it's a very forgettable movie.
