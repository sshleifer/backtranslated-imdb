This was considered to be the top-level open-source community, something that would rise and shout around the world to observe that we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our options to produce fine work with open tools source. After the base version was downloaded (a tough fan here on a dial-up modem) finally I got here I hit my first snag. Media Player, Mplayer Classic, and winamp could not open it in my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine did not open it on my server. Mplayer managed to drive without problems. It will be hard to spread the words about it if ordinary people can not even open it ... ... the movie. Beautiful sound track, superb illumination, camera master and flawless texture. Everything seemed real. Then the two main characters moved ... and they talked ... And the movie died for me. Everything, except for the synchronization of the lips and the real animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene), seemed fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were so animated that sometimes I was wondering if there are games on the market at this time with cut-out scenes that involve less realism than that. Any frame in the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and things are great if the actors do not move. I'm so glad I did not recommend this to anyone. I would break my reputation. Oh, and the final fantasy had a more cunning and cunning plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would get 10 stars if it were not for the tragedy that is right there on the screen.
