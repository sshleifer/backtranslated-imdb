Think of a non-budget version of Chinese syndrome that is directed by a film student who idols John Woo and you get "Power Play". The idea was good, but execution, acting and dialogue have absolutely killed it, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that have been used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the most exciting parts of the film. > <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group that mysteriously disappeared after entering the offices of a power plant suspected of causing an earthquake frenzy. The reporter, rather cavalier, who went against what should have been a more terrible executive of the company, is being watched around the city (along with anyone who speaks to him) to "clear" any conclusive evidence that could to remain out of plant mistakes. Unfortunately, there is no real sense of urgency, because the characters interact with much hesitation, along with idiotic dialogue and a lot of horrible actors. Not to mention, the viewer who can be attracted to the film for his appeal is forced to bear a growing number of ridiculous bodies and ridiculous amounts of violence and shootings, plus scenes of earthquake disaster. All the attention was put in a wrong place to compensate apologetically the lack of direction and a more interesting series of events that should have propelled the story. It might have been much better if the screenwriters were more focused on a thriller and would have paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy winners, a naive reporter, and those who try to warn the reporter about the wrong situation. It's a formula, but at least it would have been fun.
