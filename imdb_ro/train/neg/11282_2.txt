Following the Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking barriers, the British cinema industry quickly became swallowed by bad gangster films in the late 1990s - early '00, which seemed even more desperate today than they did at the time. In one of the great cases of porcine pearls, Rancid Aluminum's producers have firmly erased the "Best Movie of the Century" quote from a review of the ads, while omitting the rest of the sentence, pointing out that just because the moment of writing, was the only movie that was released in 2000. Looking today, it's hard to imagine how it ever did, uniting a distribution that was shortly considered the Cream of Lady's Cool Britannia's Lads Maggie Crew? Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes? but now only a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confusing adaptation of a confused novel James Hawes. The fact that the plot is never explained could be limited to the possibility that nobody really knows what it is or simply does not think it is important. Something that has to do with the businessman of Ifans, who was set up with Steven Berkoff's criminal estate, in a money-laundering or investment scheme (it's never clear, because nobody ever asks ) by the Irish accountant who was killed by Fiennes off Ifans to take over the company. Things are becoming more confused and underdeveloped there, and Ifans overlaps with the cry of his terrible life while jogging at the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and the Russian temptation accentuated by the Fitzgerald Country, Berkoff continues to say, "Bizniss "and" Francis Drake "and Fiennes makes a decent Irish accent, proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in love does not mean he is a good writing judge when it comes to film scripts. most convincing interpretations come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr, you know a movie is in big trouble. With Poland standing for a Russian full of people with Polish accents and a strange score that John Barry's pastiers to save music at Ennio Morricone Spaghetti West on a stilephone budget, he does not fully succeed in the cool stakes he pursues and ends a surprising curiosity, but almost embodied, less tongue, alone, standing there as a joke shop.
