Do not waste your time, let alone pay rent for this! How it's done is beyond me. (I do not know why there is a minimum of 10 lines ... I already summed up this trashy movie, but, oh well ...) The actor was terrible, as all of them need lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think cinema was the only thing that did not suffocate completely ... maybe the sound was minimalist. The only good thing is, if you could make this movie, even make some money with it, there can be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea. So, you all, take your heart! I think the same is true for actors ... if these people were paid, then you can!
