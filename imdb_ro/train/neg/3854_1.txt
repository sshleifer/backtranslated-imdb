Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the guidance of a reputable agent, has a lot of potential. Obviously, the person who led her in this travesty is not someone who cares about her career. I sat in the theater, surrounded by adolescents who went to battle to find another film that sneak into wondering who thinks this film would appeal to anyone. It was inadequately written, the casting director could have made only one or two minutes of effort in characters, and the director obviously did not care.
