This has had high intellectual pretensions. The main reason is to provide a "meaningful" "deep" interpretation (voice to its minds naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the "fifties / sixties" method - which, and the direction they deserved, gave amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the story is a abyss. In addition, it moves too slowly, you could edit at least 20 minutes - including unnecessary flashbacks - and the plot line would not be changed. Often, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his character "uncle," and his portrayal often comes close to parody. An interesting side is only destroyed: the relationship between the boy / hero - if we admit that the hero is himself a kind of child - When telling the child that he would not let anyone harm him, a certain sensibility appears. But it is wrong and only the final scene returns to him. : Take Foley in the neighborhood: he has two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), It's also an offbeat movie, but he hangs up, suspensefully. Here, my hitchcockometer turns its attention to zero.
