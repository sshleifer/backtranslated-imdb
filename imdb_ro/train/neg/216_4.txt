I'm not as much as Love Sick as my image. Finally, the film expresses the sexual relationship between Alex, kik and Sandu, their triangular love was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, and Alex finally woke up and realized they would not have the result and the future. <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was in the AMC theater on Sunday, 12:00, on 08/10/06, together with us we watched the movie together. After the film, he told the public that the intention to create this film to express Romanian sexual relations was a kind of complication. From my point of view, sexual life is always complicated in all places, I do not feel any particular impression or effect in the film. The love process of Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sandu were a kind of neighborhood story next door. The two main reasons why I do not like this movie are first of all that the movie did not tell us how they started to fall in love? Apparently, after Alex moved to the building where Kiki lived, then two girls fall in love. It does not make sense at all. How a girl will fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you have to imagine them and connect them in the mind. Second, the entire movie did not have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual act, that's what I've been waiting for. However, it still had some parts deserved to recommend. The "piercing" part was quite interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the piercing pain to appreciate Kik's love. It was a moving scene that gave you a little idea about their love. The scene was also on the football field, the conversation expressing their love being true and passionate.
