I did not see the original, but I wanted to make a quick note to anyone who's going down so far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I'd like to be able to ask the theater to turn my money or come back to warn me not to see it. I'm going to give him two positive knots: The sarcasm of Cage's character had at least some laughter from me and the island's landscape was beautiful. I'm sorry, that's all. Here they are. The story of the movie is propelled just before, because other characters will not give Cage any direct answer - and he does it! How it could take more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. Leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How can someone read this scenario and think "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shadowy scheme of what a movie should look like" is beyond me. You're not going to see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
