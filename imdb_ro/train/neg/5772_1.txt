I just have to add, if someone actually reads this and has not come to the point yet. These other reviewers do not joke around, this is really the worst color movie you'll ever see. When the movie started, I could not believe that something like that really did it for the world to see. I'm not just saying when they say it looks like a home movie. Not really. Like the "director", he took the hi8 family video camera (in front of the DV cameras and nonlinear editing on the computer), no other equipment (lights, sound, etc.), took some decent students and went out to film a movie. No scenario, just do it while he went. When I looked, it was on my Mono TV, so I just have an audio channel (left-right speaker). At first I thought I'd be crazy. The film was silent until someone spoke a few minutes. I got up and walked over the other channel and suddenly heard music and sound effects, but then he did not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to look at, so bad they're good, sort of things. I'm not sure this is one of them. I mean, I'll admit I'm a little movie maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE that you can do better, you know. But that's what made me feel sorry for who she did. So bad as such, actors are the only good thing about it. I thought the chicken was hot and he was disappointed with the short stage of the bath. A bit of T and A from her would have increased the score from nothing to maybe 3 or 4. But unfortunately not. If you want to make a movie, but it turns into nonsense, it throws free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
