Let's hope this is the last nightmare. This is the symbol of a good thing. Well, there is still a joy to do, but only in the most banal sense. Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had been part of the production and even produced. I do not know what he was thinking, but this disaster comes in addition to the video game boy and a guest with Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I would like to know what he was thinking when he wrote / directed this disappointing piece of trash. He even tried to distract him from the fact that this film was nothing more than an over-glorified popcorn film, instead of bringing any resemblance to horror, with the controversial use of a 3D final. Are not those smart glasses? And you can keep them! It's his equivalent, you just spent $ 9.00, making me rich. Here's 10 cents. Now, do not you feel special? I'm sorry, but for me, it just did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy still had another face lift. That was for the worst, I think. All the beautiful art that came into his "look" in previous films was replaced by an obviously cheaper and less detailed set of prosthesis. She looks ... less like the burned victim she should be doing more and more as if she had a skin disorder. Changing lead makeup so far in a series is about the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They did this and they did that. So I think it does not matter. But it was important to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. He's just ... a monster at a low price, like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the classic horror promised by this series; unlucky with what you can only believe that the writers would have thought they were one-line wizards and speaks intelligently (unfortunately, it fell on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So there is nothing to say except taking popcorn and preparing to laugh, because it was not a scary or suspense moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a 3.2 / 10 rate of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
