I was willing to take on a lot of spring / summer funnel movies, but generally this is due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payments (ie special effects, interesting plot, Steve Buscemi, etc.). This movie, however, had nothing of all. Everything I received was the cheap emotion of a few moments from the split of Eva Longoria (a matter of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I would go into the specific, but honestly I already - maybe, willingly, forgot most of the film. <br /> <br /> As long as I was in the theater, I hit because I was not spending the afternoon watching a 24-season DVD. Save your money on this, folks. If not really, indeed, like Eva Longoria's sparkle.
