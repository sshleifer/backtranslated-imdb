Camera - Why does the camera work in this movie so nervous? This is annoying and distracting. Edit - Photo blinks were too short. Many of the other scenes were too short. Just blinks. Sound - background music was too loud and covered the voices. You should not resume and resume to catch what has been said. No one checks these things and makes them do it again. Reduce background music volume in the future. Is the adjustment of relative sound levels editor function, Julia Wong? The land had too many free ends. The story line had a potential. I think the film needed more work. Was he rushed? Maybe they were out of money. Like a lot of movies, it started to be big, but it escaped to the end. I really do not understand this, you know that you have the storyboard before going into production, so why not all the free ends get taken care of in the storyboard. I'm sorry I'm so critical.
