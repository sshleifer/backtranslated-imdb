At this moment I'm debating if I should even finish seeing this "poppycock" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible disorder has no real story. There is the buried set, a monster with wolves in the front running amok, an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked all that is. What I would have missed if it had the common sense to remove this nonsense is a pursuit with buggy dunes, some C.GI, very stupid, an incredibly stupid, worse C.G.I., and heroic war paper. Apart from the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redemption qualities. My mistake to keep looking. - MERK
