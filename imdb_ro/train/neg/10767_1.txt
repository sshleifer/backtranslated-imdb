Not only was the most expensive Canadian film ever filmed in BC but slightly worse without seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and the boy looks. We are all prepared to be a bunch of overlapping drug beings and spirits. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and that should be the reason why we are financing this bunk. Of course, British character is normal. The rest is a stereotype harvest of sitcom - can you say "Norm!"? Cinematography ranges from cute pictures with postcards to silent interior silhouettes. The actors always seem sneaky. Are they as bored as the viewer, or is it the idea of ​​film directors? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce McDonalds' movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematic. You will not have to go to HIS movies after 10 minutes.
