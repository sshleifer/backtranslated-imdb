The more B movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that is so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to stay. A high school lonjer student, who is constantly chosen by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking on his trailer tomb, having sex with a drunken redhead. Then he takes the child to a nearby field of corn and kills him. Apparently, the soul of the children was transferred to a scarecrow, which then revolves around killing the bastards who also tormented the teachers. This scarecrow, in addition to having a unique lining for each of his victims, can also make Matrix storms through the air and kill people on the sidewalks in natural light. Also, why did he always look like a rotten corpse? Like the two unnecessary sequels that followed, this is not worth a laugh.
