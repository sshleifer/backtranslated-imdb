*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERI *** From its first opening credits, this fantastic movie sets a straight record: it's a classic instant. It does not take too long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than the "Kindergarten Child" or "Police Academy 7". Great grandeur left me bitter when I left the cinema and I immediately went to the counter to buy my dozens of tickets. This is a movie that simply requires more views. The first view will surely leave you with that weird "Huh?" feeling, but do not feel embarrassed - it happens to the best of us. The story is so diabolically intelligent that it must question the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot that infiltrates the FBI is proving to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about things really important in life. The complexity of the plot structure will bother you at the first views, but do not give up! Until my sixth or seventh view, I only began to reveal some of Corky Romano's hidden mysteries. And watch the unexpected twist at the end, otherwise you might be on guard when it turns out that FBI agent Brick Davis is the most wanted killer of the FBI, Corky is not a real agent of the FBI, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate and Paulie Romano leaves the closet as a homosexual. Surprised by the hell out of me, I can tell you so much. Chris Kattan's comic talents are unparalleled as he leads Corky Romano's character through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. The reminiscence of John Reynolds' performance in "Manos, the hands of fate", Kattan takes countless multiple personalities and addresses all scenes with a perfect comedy time. However, Kattan is not just about comedy. He is also a master of drama because he controls the feelings of the public with the smallest movements of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself in a way. For example, in the stage where he is heading to the faces of his brethren, you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation reflected in his terrible image. At some point, it's hard to find a dry eye in the house. Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of "Corky Romano". With a story of greatness, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers must be hired to complete this ambitious project. Their ingenious storytelling and unorthodox structure make "Pulp Fiction" look like a mediocre jumping on Saturday. Garret's and Ward's story is so compelling and appealing that it swallows your hair, swallows you in full, shakes you, and spits you straight away. At the end of the experience outside of this world, known as "Corky Romano," are you a different person with different views on the world and different ideas, and with one question in your mind: God? Why?!?
