This is a terrible movie. All three stories are accompanied by a hypnotic psychiatric line that is not necessary and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and a lady, there are some things that make no sense, but the work of hypnotism does for it. The second, with bad Bill Paxton as a roommate fellow, should not be looked at by anyone. The last, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which I think makes him better than the other garbage.
