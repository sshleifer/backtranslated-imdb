I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of carp. This movie is worse than the "Deadly Friend." Now the plot is bad, the act is mediocre and the movie is deadly boring. I do not know why Wes Craven hates the debut "The Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes (probably) this turkey. Do not misunderstand me, I really like some movies, but it was a real torture that was seated and forgotten.
