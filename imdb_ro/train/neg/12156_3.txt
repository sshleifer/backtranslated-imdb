Jesus Christ, I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I just looked for Jordan Ladd's passion. But I forget that this movie puts me close to me. This is absolutely terrible! I might look at the Survivor Series 93 about this. The type of leader in this case was so gentle and generic. I would love if the great tiger Mistuharu Misawa led her to the bottom of a glass window, and I would upset every time she said "lake" and "cabin." I would give it a shot Jordan Ladd, on the other hand , he was absolutely wonderful, but a real angel, but he could not even save this whole joke of a movie, but he could not act as if he was outside of it when he took that medicine of truth. I also liked the little that Jordan accidentally poured yogurt on her. He remembered a moment when ... ever ... I never look at this movie because of the terrible his.
