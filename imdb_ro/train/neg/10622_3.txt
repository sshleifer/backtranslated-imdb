Actually, I have a love for Christopher Lee, but this has not been up to his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. The film does not stand up to its premise. It's not that scary, it's too melodramatic and it's dear. Every time I thought, "Oh, here's the good side," the good side never came. The evil one is not at all convincing. Most of the other characters were also incomplete. Perhaps, if I were in the right mind plan, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at the expense of this film, but ... Naaahhh ... It did not seem worth the effort. It was not really good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
