"I'm curious: yellow" is a bunch of steaming and pretentious. It does not matter what political opinion is because this movie can be hardly taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that the masculine front nudity is a NC-17 automatic, this is not true. I've seen R-rated movies with male nudity. Granted, they offer only some fleeting visions, but where are R-rated movies with thriving vulva and stabbing lashes? Nowhere, because it does not exist. The same thing happens for those bad cable shows: the schlongs revolve in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And those indie films, like The Bunny Brown, where we're treated to Jonathan Gallo's site, but not a visible pink trail on Chloe Sevigny. Before complaining (or involving) the "double-standard" nudity, mental obturation should take into account an obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genital organs when actresses appear nude and can not be said the same for a man. In fact, in general, you will not see female genitalia in an American film in any other than explicit pornography or erotic. This supposed double standard is less a double standard than a often depressing ability to conform to culture with women's bodies.
