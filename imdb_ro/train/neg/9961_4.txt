Amelia and Michael are a married couple who are mistaken for each other. Amelia has a long-time boyfriend in the hospital and Michael is hiring a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two dudes with their infidelity, but they manage to connect to each other in the end. There is not a lot in this short short. The direction is direct and dramatic, which is good, the action is sincere, but the story leaves little to be desired. Why do we care about these two people? It is hard to see how this story goes out of any other story of infidelity, except that it is more inclined and not looking for meaning in it (a welcoming change of rhythm if there is anything). I do not know, I may not connect to these stories because I never experienced them. But I noticed that blocking in these narratives is typically the same, that is, a couple talking together while avoiding visual contact by claiming to be submerged in magazines etc. The beautiful stuff of short films is that it offers a little more space because you tried something different and I would like to see it differently.
