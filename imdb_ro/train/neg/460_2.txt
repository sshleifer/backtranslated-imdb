I was asked to watch the movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I was paid), but I still found the film suck far more than the average. The banknotes were the blades, the two leading actresses ... well, to use the "First Wives Club" division of Hollywood women's age, they are no longer the "hot chicks", but the older "lawyer district ". What made me most nervous about the movie was the main plot line, which almost completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which boys are all jazzed on a guy who offers money "to make his wife" , without realizing it should assassinate her. In general, a piece of shit.
