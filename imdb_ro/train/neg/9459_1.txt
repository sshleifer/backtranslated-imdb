Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines summarize this little film, which can only attract idiot kids and their parents to the cinema. and his movie ... # 1 in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese ladies who fall asleep in 3 minutes. A strange plan with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham come out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (no) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two drivers trying to find the green eggs and eggs. They will try to chase Sam-I-Am and the guy who runs her. (I hope not to ruin the classic book.) Do not waste your time and money by seeing this.
