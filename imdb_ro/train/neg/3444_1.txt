This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, although the photographs, "special effects", the act, and I mentioned the plot? Everything in him has sucked his ass! This is a good example of what "over-doing" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie is trying to do; this should have been one of those movies that you can not really tell what the hell is going on until the end. Stay fascinated without knowing who is dead and who is alive and who killed who and why and when you think you got the right chronology, you found out that you are wrong and the movie is over - leaving you an open mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. But Olga Levens, the writer of this junk, yes, Olga? Writer, director, producer, scriptwriter, Caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also a double for one of the characters are a few scenes ... this is a movie with a woman and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions" you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, this could come as a shocker, but "this time" Olga did this great time, jumping from scene to scene, from dreams to reality ... but wait! this was a dream in the end ... or was it? The picture fades and I realized that none happened, the little girl was alone on the ship ... in fact there was no ship ... do not wait! It's the ship and the boys again! I am alive! Thank God! They do not want her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears so maybe they're dead after all ??? or maybe they have never been alive to start with? If you understand what I said you might want this movie - otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason we set out for this whole carp is to find out how the hell can be done this movie ... Do not look at it if you cherish the time, 90 minutes are a waste in this case ...
