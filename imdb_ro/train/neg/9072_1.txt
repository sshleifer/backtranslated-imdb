This movie has no plot or focus. Yes, it should have been a slap, a bad comedy, but the screenwriters have no idea what it was about the movie. Even the title does not go along with the movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares what's going on with them! The roommate's character (from the 70-year-old show) was the only person to watch. She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. Others have to make sure that their college degrees are at work because they will need a career other than to act.
