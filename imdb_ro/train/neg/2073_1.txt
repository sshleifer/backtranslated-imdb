Oh God. God, I can not get over this movie. He was terrible of God. Terrible merry! Do not even waste the money to buy it in the 99-cent coin. No, avoid it at any cost I warn you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-Girl? Are you kidding me. Get the reality that sounds like a kind of new Barbie doll .. Super Women? Are you kidding me. It was false false false so fake. People in the town did not even seem to care that she was a flying blonde who was just approaching the town by saving a fire. Ohh great! Isuse, was it just me or did it seem like a offensive movie? I think what you need to be the super hero is a couple of D hair, blond blond hair, no glasses and a leather skin tight tight! If she were trying to be romantic ... than ... God, I do not know. It was horrible, if love is to give some to a show of art and to have sex in a bed and in the air ... than they had love! It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First of all, the guy was alone, than he met with G-girl ... than they broke up before he met Hannah ... and ... she's just going. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me wonder .. How the hell did they do it in the theaters? <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at any price.
