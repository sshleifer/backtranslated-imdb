I loved the movie very emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain violence, sex, drugs or special effects and does not need a bit, always paying attention with visuals, stories and words of wisdom interleaved. However: [1] some of the accents of languages ​​have made the dialogue difficult to understand and understand; [2] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing (especially the word F, which is the only reason why this movie was rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and excitement, but most of the emotion you hold throughout the film, with the exception of the last minute final resolution, is unpleasant due to the long-awaited dysfunctional reaction of some characters, living in the depth of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I will not recommend this movie because of the 5-second background narrative that did not add a bit to the side character she applied, or the movie - just let me go to the film and my brain stayed in the whole film and then: mother of the main character of the German ancestors, watching films from the Second World War, "hidden roots for the Germans." There would be "local color" or art if the Nazis won the war. I do not even know the Germans today, except for the skinheads radicals who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis would win the Second World War.
