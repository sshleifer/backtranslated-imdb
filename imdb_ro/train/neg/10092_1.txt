Seriously crappy movie. First, the movie starts with a policeman and his partner parked outside a warehouse / furniture store. Wicked police pick up a girl they fired at the storehouse bridge while the newbie policeman stands out and thinks about what might happen there. The "bad" policeman finally returns with a heavy duffel bag and the beginner policeman does not think there are any problems but he still wonders what's in the bag, so he asks, gets a shit and then thinks everything is OK (now). The "bad" policeman repeats this process, and even with a scene type (he did a little better). But, ultimately, people start catching up, which lasted for a while, considering how obvious it was. A girl receives a voodoo curse on her just in case she dies, like you. Now, the "bad" policeman finally kills this magic-protected bitch and then escapes the duffel body. Since she puts on magic, she turns with a lot of shadowy eyes on, which should indicate that she can be a zombie ... Also, the magic curse causes all the other girls to become "monsters eye-shadow ". Some of the girls meet with a guy, who is apparently a forex specialist, and offers them a walk (they seem normal to him, apparently). But when girls see other people, such as a girl husband, he gets angry because he is hideous (some people get scared, but others do not even see) ... massive hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> So to wrap it, killing monster monsters kill the cop "bad", who in turn gets to become a zombie in the last scene. It was like trying to prepare us for a sequel! Like anyone who wants to see part 2 of this falling cow.
