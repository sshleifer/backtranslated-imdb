A police officer (Robert Forster) in a riotous murder city has his attacked wife and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a killer at a gas station. After the murderers escape grace to a corrupt judge and himself is locked up for 30 days for the contempt of the court, he decides to take things in his own hands by joining a group of vigilant led by a caregiving doggie Fred Williamson. These types of Robin Hood sort out any criminal the law does not want to accuse, and with their help they try to pursue those who have wronged him. This film is nothing but a big o'clichés. The only common thing is killing a two-year-old boy who was sick enough. Otherwise, the business as usual for this type, for example, involves a lot of car tracking, beatings and shots mixed with a lot of male posts. I could have done without the jail fight in the shower, still involving those good inmates. Also, they were out of money before filming the latest scenes? I say this because it ends very suddenly, with little closing. If anyone knows, give me a bell .. in fact, do not bother. To end: File under "Forgottable Nonsense". Next → ..
