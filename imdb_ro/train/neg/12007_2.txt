It is amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to theater until the day of liberation. I mean ... look at the distribution here, the promotion is superb, the songs are pretty good and the trailers are good. This makes it a full house on the first day, but only when people go and see the movie realize that there is no way for their money to be reimbursable. The house full of the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by "Love in fact" is what they say, did not manage to handle the whole good. They tried to put in big stars, but they even failed to bring even average performance. The stories are naked and cheesy, so the audience can not connect with any of them. It is a great disappointment for all who like the big stars or, as the case may be, Nikhil Advani after his big success of "Kal Ho Na Ho".
