I should make an alert everywhere saying the film should not be looked at. She fails a proper tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was horrible, I did not expect the Director's total failure to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun that normally burn at a rate of 600 rounds per minute to 1/10 of the speed? How can soldiers fall before a grenade explodes in front of them? How can humans survive when there are artillery shells that are nearly 20 meters away? How do artillery shells only fall on both sides of the road and not on the road itself? Not only this lack of respect for arms disturbs me, but also the cliché situations and the incongruity of the dialogues my killing called me. There have been standard dialogues such as Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan is jyaada musalmaan at Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cruce mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least. What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without script and looks. There is no flow in the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just a shot of the next, not related to the general scheme of the war. Explanatory scenarios are terrible. The head of the army's staff does not seem convincing. To make things worse, theater people cut the images indiscriminately to fit the film four hours in 3 hours.
