It's just not the quality I've been expecting from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This movie is very similar to a student movie. What concerns me in all of this is why won a BAFTA ??? Morris enjoys the "mediocrity enshrined" (Ayn Rand) largely from his work (Nathan Barley) and yet with this urinous piece on the bottom of the talented and tells us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope he chose a subject that I would like to address (Four Lions human terrorism) that he will not crap this, losing the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of ignorance mainstream and opinion on these emotional and violent phenomena.
