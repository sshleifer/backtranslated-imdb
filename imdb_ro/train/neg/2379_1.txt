Recognize. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and she has made a mission to see every movie he was (unfortunately including the terrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and that. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, it is even lower than the Avengers). everyone seems lost in it and is inconsistent beyond faith. <br /> <br /> Even if you think Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE NOT to submit to this movie. you will hate the next morning for this.
