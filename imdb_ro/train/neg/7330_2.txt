Kill Me Later "has an interesting preoccupation: a suicide woman (Selma Blair), who is about to jump from the top of an office building, protects a banker thief (Max Beesley) who promises to" kill her more The actual execution of this premise, however, collapses because almost every action acts as a simple device to move the plot to its predictable conclusion. Written characters that have no reason to behave compromise the quality of everyone's action The lack of depth of the character falls especially in the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn folds from being miserable to the "cool" actor and eventually meets like a confused dolt, which is unfortunate, because under other circumstances, Mrs. Blair is an appealing and capable actress <br /> <br /> Ingredients are insufficient for the insistence of director D Lustig to use quick cuts, special incongruent effects (for example, look for an unintended end-of-the-line motorcycle blow) and a hip ring hoping to call MTV's short attention. Of course, Ms. Lustig proves she is capable of mastering the technical side of the direction, but in no way helps them overcome the inherent problems of the film, and so the film is over. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be praised for their ability to make this film: they have managed to scare up to $ 1.5 million to fund the film, ensure good distribution, and get an internal and external distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent film. However, given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
