Spend time in any other way, even homework is better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the funny riffs that Dr. Seus are not there. A very strange way to lose an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a bit at first, the younger ones got bored of it and left to play Barbies, and the older ones let him play ps2 and sail on the net. My wife left and made dishes. So we're done alone. It was the worst "kids" movie I've ever seen. If you want to watch a fun movie for kids, watch Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It's not funny, it's not cute, cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see it on the label of the disc.
