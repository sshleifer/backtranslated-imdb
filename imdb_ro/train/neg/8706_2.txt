If this is the first time you encounter the wonders of the cinema, if you have never seen a "Picture on the Go", you will think that this movie is a child of the gods. BAR, if you saw a movie, a TV show, even Barney the Dinosaur, then you will not be very impressed with this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinosaur in this movie. Now I like B movies. I just looked at "The Giant Gila Monster" just before watching this and I liked that movie much better. It works like a movie B. It has a laser dialogue, a worse action, cheating effects and a true Gila Monster as a monster! Carno 3 just does not pack a large part of B movie. She has a gore, and that type Polchek is coming to be funny a few times, but this movie is overwhelming, almost flaccid. It's the small engine they could not do from dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can try to dry the gums on the sidewalk and feel entertained. If you're one of those people, give it a movie to this movie.
