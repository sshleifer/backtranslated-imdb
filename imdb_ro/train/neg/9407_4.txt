"Houseboat Horror" is often considered to be the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical film, which has been promoting "See the movie that can not get an Academy Award". Some members of the underground lane start to die cutting dead maniac while trying to shoot a musical video on a lake off the Australian. He moved easily and with a squeaking, with anxiety and annoying characters. Surely he gives gore: the heads are half-split with a model, the neck is cut, and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like slasher cheese movies, you can try this, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
