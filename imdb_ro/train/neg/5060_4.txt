This movie is a perfect adaptation of Flick of English Unfaithful. Ashmit plays Richard Gere, Olivier's Emran and Malikka, the role of Lane's deceptive wife. They changed the second half of the film to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then, the film has traces of unbelievers, although it has failed to reach its original. It was a cheap soft porn for Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran has made several roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future, if Indian directors intend to remember a movie in English, then they have to consider the feasibility of the plot with the Indian censors. Although the film bombed at the box office, the actors have received unjustified recognition. In the future, directors should be a little more careful when playing an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> They all said it was not a family movie, so take extra time while you see it at home with your family.
