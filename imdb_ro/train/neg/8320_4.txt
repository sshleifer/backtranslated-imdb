After I saw Awake, I led to a conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator, for the mere fact that the movie is full of ridiculous elements. Awake has many plot holes and is full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform, the spirit of the main character uses ... the ghost of a doctor leaving it in the floor?) The concept behind this film is slightly clever, but all the holes plot and absurd things make this movie a stupid and stupid movie. With the exception of Lena Olin, all actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero phrases and the same holds true for Jessica Alba. Extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is scattered enormously. Awake makes a laughing spectator. He is so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it is impossible to take him seriously. My recommendation is: skip this terrible movie.
