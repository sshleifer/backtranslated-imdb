This movie is forged in an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was best when they broke this movie. Terrible action, bad makeup, weak effects, chick in underwear (1960). I give her one. The evil person is hard to understand because of the makeup. The assistant says things like "I will not" that sounds like NACHOO! (I think sneeze). It's just a bad oratory. The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what the "designed man" means in the plot. I missed the beginning. <br /> <br /> What happens to this minimum 10 lines per post?
