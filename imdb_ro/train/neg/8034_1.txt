I know the slashes should be bad, but come on, what the hell is that? It's like a group of 10-year-olds who have saved their money and started filming this until the end of the week. <br /> <br /> Anyway, six young people all go to the same house to be killed on the screen. We have a smart one, the bitch, the other guy, the black guy, the killer, the stereotypes like that. and the others are being watched by a guy wearing a mask that people in the poor box have denied. There is a fairly decent crime somewhere in the middle, but then it turns to boredom and especially to frightening dreams. Seriously, in fact, we know he can not be the killer when a person is attacked because the guy certainly loves to take his sweet time for everything. Every person you expect to die dies, the ugly blonde cat and her boyfriend who will soon be caught by the killer (they feel, pushed and then lesbian) and the killer reveals himself. I think the writers of this film just got a sunglasses and a pen and put it somewhere on the character list. The reason is just lame and do not even start me to get back on the fucking secret. too much time to explain everything (and then about ten extra minutes in which he cuts his own arm for some reason) and eventually becomes overwhelmed by a guy with a gun. Hey, no fair! one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could enjoy a lot more, looking at Lindsay Lohan, I swear. I mean, most of those 80 years have spit, but at least they have thrown in the movie. has nothing to do.
