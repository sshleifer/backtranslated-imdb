This movie should be a love story about Santa Claus and his magic and mystic miracles. But in return it comes as creepy. Two things in this movie that stand out in my mind are frightening: 1) the way Santa looks. - Have you ever seen a more horrible Santa Claus? and 2) "the evil replica of Satan". The pitch just strange weird dances are just bad to look at. Just watch this movie if it happens to be the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can not believe it's a children's movie.
