Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find the paint to be too interesting, I would suggest. If you like some cheap movies like me, it's good for a chick! Besides, I would not suggest to rent it, I would wait until it arrives on the tube, saying around 4 am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. The band that made this soundtrack was on its way about two years after this film, and did not sound as bad in life, according to the two little reviews we could find on them. So once again good, if you find grass growing for a lot of fun, but good to forget if you want to see how not to shoot a low-budget movie.
