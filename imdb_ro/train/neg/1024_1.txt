I saw this movie at the toronto film festival with quite solid expectations. the movie has a large cast and closes at the festival so it must be okay, right? how bad I was. <br /> <br /> We knew we were in difficulty when, before the film, the director was talking about how, when he was conducting an episode of wisdom, he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (a Wiseguy director / writer) debuting = blah) ... and Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating pictures of Kevin Spacey, killing a homeless man, because I do not see how he (along with the other actors in the movie) would have been agree to be in this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible! is a mixture of every clich√© ever drunk by the police. there's nothing new with Edison. the act was bad and the direction was even worse. resembles that episode of wisdom mentioned above. this was best done directly to the video I've ever seen. Some examples of silly stupid moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment without any reason to rock and roll music ... justin timberlake gets creative criticism from his belle while the apartment his is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firefighter ... 3 boys being shot in the head ... this movie is the opposite of the good. <br /> <br /> STAY OUT EDISON!
