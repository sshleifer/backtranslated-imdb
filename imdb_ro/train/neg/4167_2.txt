I was eager to see Mr. Fix It because I'm a great fan of David Boreanaz. What I received was a 1-1 / 2-hour nap. The premise seemed pleasant: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a business called "Mr. Fix It," in which the men who are being dumped are asking for help to make their girlfriends take them back. the film is editing, screenplay and acting. Although I found Boreanaz delighted in the other roles of his film (except the movie "Crow"), it was disappointing. Sometimes his character was interesting, others were flat. The supportive speech reminded me of the soap players. I realize it was not a big budget movie, but some cuts and music did not seem right. My advice: Watch yourself at your own risk.
