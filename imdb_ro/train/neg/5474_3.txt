To be fair, they did as well as a five-shill and six pence budget, but the dialogue was darker than 9 lbs of emmental, and the CGI was now a fairly old hat. maybe if some actors were not so upgraded from granite, they would have made the movie better .. Telling it terrible to make this movie a wrong job If you want to see something that's totally you have to sit and lose a few hours of your life watching the sickle, that's really terrible, actually good mind (many big alcoholic beverages are deriguer though.) Any way up, I liked this movie and it's worth watching if you do not you've seen it yet, you did not expect anything like "jurassic park, lost world" or "apocalipto."
