Many people prefer to straighten this TV movie when they quarreled with Hanks-philes' big legions out there that Tom actually made horror films (I think the "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons-style" game, which eventually leads our young Gump to hallucinating madness. The story is delightful in the early 1980s, focusing as it happens on the imminent threat to our youth represented by those evil-play games. However, I prefer to see "Maze and monsters" indicated in "What happened to Chris Makepeace?" story. We all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and unhappy Clifford in "Bodyguard," where he gave us a hot push, defeating Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who regularly read "Dynamite!") That big things were in store for him. And then Rona Jaffe came. The line between bad action and bad writing is thin razor, so I let her decide what the fault of Makepeace's performance in it. All I know is that the last major version I saw was "Vamp," and that was 1986. She had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and Snowman," but until then he was Brat Pack has been passed over to others with more straight hair and gentler reps. I can not recommend this movie in good conscience. Watch him if only to see a young, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul.
