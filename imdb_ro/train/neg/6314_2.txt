I like Seth Green. His appearances on the 70's are always useful, but last night I felt the show needed for the review. Four young men inherited a New York apartment, for which most of us would die. The grandmother must have been an heir to have such a space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism. However, the plot about the four best friends who got this apartment was not credible. I would have been delighted if they had to move with one of their parents, which would have given a great deal of humor and dysfunction in organizing the show. It did not seem to be a lot of humor in it. I just forget that it falls before my name is Earl on a winning night on Thursday. I think he should come back, remove this series and start. We need more family families involved. How about Seth and his friends moving with his parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place. It could be Dabney Coleman playing father and Christine Estabrook, playing mother and dysfunctional brothers. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless, and the network blows it.
