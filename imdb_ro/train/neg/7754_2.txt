Spoilers will be in this. The movie could have been better if it had only a different script, director and provider of CGI. It's not good? The movie has a man who starts his own theme park ... err ... the zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and it's called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not bother rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for such movies, but that has hit you in front of it despite the fact that there's even "the shadowy head of the design creature." Sabbaths, who are not saboteurs according to Mr. Primal Park (Just Old Cats Killing), are pretty junky, but crowning is what I call "sloggy." Because after having ordered a big cat, a hero relaxes a little, because there is only one left. Enter the strange type of food that says: Nah, I made three, the third is a monster that pulls the front legs. Great, groovy. A group of students are also on the island for a diving hunt, there is a test to get into their crutch or sorting clips (Always thought she needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has fulfilled his task, so I kicked that. Oh yes, mandatory "Cliff Evil Capitalist Must Die" Clique is in effect with none, but two of them! Mr Primal Park's death is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these films as a jar of the Courtesy of Sloggy, a toothpaste, diminishing in a few dimensions and hitting the man through his neck. If I had escaped so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
