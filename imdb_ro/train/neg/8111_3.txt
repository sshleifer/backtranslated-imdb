Another extraordinary film by Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the involvement of the US in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be correct, but it is a fact that the US has been deeply involved in strikes and support from Latin American dictatorships. Despite this, although the spirit of the film follows the typical left / communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer, and his films are always biased. For example, he portrays the US's actions as brutal and inhuman, while it represents Tupamaros's extremist activities as something positive. As it turned out to have been a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America, the US was involved. Europe is full of poor prostitutes in Eastern Europe. I have never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls who prostituted in mass, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The United States struggled with a dirty war, and God blessed us that the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is regrettable that the US had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world, as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros thought. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. Also in this film follows the corrupt and faltering left-wing ideology of the past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct.
