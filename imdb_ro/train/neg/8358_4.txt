It's not one of Arbuckle's or Keaton's movies, that's for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of the whole drink, so she takes her to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed treatment! Well, once, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery. Then he escapes and is traced around the place where a pretty girl meets who wants to escape. Finally, despite the fact that the staff is following them, they escape, in which moment it becomes obvious that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is recaptured soon. However, he wakes up and everything after surgery was a dream - there was a sexy mad girl and Dr. Keaton is not as incompetent as he seemed to dream. humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Of course, the fun of mentally ill people is quite low, but in its days it was guaranteed laughing. And I would laugh if it was funny to answer! A lot of energy and that's all. FYI - During a tracking sequence, Fatty wonders in a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances?). And, shortly thereafter, he returned to a post that the number 5 was just freshly painted. As a result, the five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and look like a regular attendee. However, the number should have appeared back on Fatty's shirt, but it came out - a mistake, because he had to realize that the mirror image would have been backward.
