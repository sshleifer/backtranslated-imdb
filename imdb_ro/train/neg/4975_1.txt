After seeing the Canadian / Icelandic / British "Beowulf & Grendel" in 2004, which I thought was brilliant and stunning, I approached this - the first of three Beowulf movies that came out again this year - with fear. As soon as I heard Viking and I saw the horns, I moaned. These were Swedes of migration and Danes, not the Vikings (they came later). Nor did the Vikings ever wear horns on their helmets (the horns make it easier for your enemy to hit your helmet and then believe you). Then is the palace of Hrolfgar, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark in the sixth century. The swords and the armor looked like props remaining from previous films set in different historical periods. I saw weapons that could have been used by crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven," and a character even had a Windlass Steelcrafts sword from Beowulf & Grendel! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dull, and the total woodworking and unconvincing. The largest would have been a barrel with the secret weapon, complete with the sphere of vision and exploding projectiles, which seemed something bought by the Iraqi insurgents. The Monster with Special Effects and his mother were so steroidy that Beowulf could not break an arm, as he did in poetry. Thank gods for bazooka crossbows! I can go on, but I will not.
