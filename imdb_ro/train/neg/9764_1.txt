In a word ... abisal. I give her a star for hippie scenes and candy-colored women, otherwise you forget it. Corman's most difficult effort, none. Ben Vereen should have given his name permanently from the distribution. I can not believe it will be on DVD (2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I got sick in bed this morning with a cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer on others, to scan the digital channels ... the premise seemed quite interesting because I like to see the B movie , hippie culture and teen rebels. He seemed familiar with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start of my day. Just after I saw him, I know now why familiarity has slipped into the depths of my newly awakened brain. I remembered seeing the attractions that came for this film as a 14-year-old (45 years old) in the early / mid-seventies at Sombrero, a local art theater that does not exist anymore ... the entire theater laughed hysterically and even cried out loud how bad this movie was. Act: terrible, story: awful, cinematography: almost terrible, music: terrible, sound: terrible, director: a joke. If you choose to follow this after my warning, remember ... "I told you so." "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this confused film - or maybe you should be taken to a "gas" room to lose your brain. I have seen Super 8 home movies that have put this film in shame. Certainly a new addition to my Top Ten WORST movies all the time ... is up there (er, down) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
