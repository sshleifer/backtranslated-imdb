I could not believe my eyes when I looked at Dutch television yesterday in Nuremberg. It starts very slowly, the backdrop of the Nuremberg trials becomes clear, the Germans have a funny English accent, but then, suddenly, in the last minutes of the first part of the series, the audience gets to see the most shocking, frightening, I've ever seen. It is important for people to see such material (although I absolutely do not agree that there is not a minimum age at which children can be exposed to this type of material), but in this film it was completely ridiculous. It was simply meant to improve the impact of a regular TV series. It was meant to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly light. Instead of trying to move around with well-done scenes, inspiring an interesting dialogue or point of view, the audience is tortured with horrific images of prisoners in the skin and bone camp. It does not show any respect for the victims of the Holocaust. I am very upset.
