I understand what he tried to film this movie. As the ages are often ignored and treated as an annoyance, which means that they end up feeling unappreciated and that their life is empty. I have no problem with this message, but I feel it could have been passed in a way that is not so painful to follow. I like a good art movie, but when a movie becomes too artistic (in this case), the result is often frustrating. Including photos of a person packing a slow, 5-minute suitcase tries to make a point, but just ends up bothering the audience. The female characters are very weak and you get to tell them pull them together. This is a movie you think you should enjoy or miss very and certainly has its merits, but I was too frustrated watching it for someone else to recommend it. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell films (for example: "Notting Hill"), but at least it was a movie you could watch.
