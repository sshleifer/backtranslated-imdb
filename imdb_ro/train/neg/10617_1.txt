Perhaps encouraged by her admirers much better "Orlando", Potter here offers a vehicle for her in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes music, including a mawkish love song. The movie resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her intimate love and melodramatic obsessions are just as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is just as insane as the object of his romantic obsession that can not be touched, and the whole movie is an embarrassing show of narcissism that acts as a tango celebration. Perhaps if he had not thrown himself, it might have worked. It simply can not act, whether playing or not. Pretentious, too ambitious, boring and stupid.
