Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past, so he invests in a club and deals with the issues that belong to him. it was .... I saw the trailer and I knew instantly that it would be bad. But after giving up the movies in the past and found out they were wonderful (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). I gave a shot and failed in the first five minutes ... The scenario is something a teenager would come up with if he had five minutes to prepare ... It was weaker, weaker dialogue. There seems to be an instant need for romance in a gangster film. So Brigante decides to beat a guy for the girl ... and she says "Yes!" And if you have to act badly just throw racism around ... As we learn from "Italian mobsters" ... The actor was terrible to say at least ... I found "Hollywood Nicky," hilarious. I absolutely hate all these musicians who return to the movies. We face the only reason P Diddy made this movie to play a gangster ... The actress who plays Leticia was poor but beautiful. The sex scene was poor, but we came to see it ... what was good ... But in general I expected to see how Carito got into prison and the love of his life ... And the assassin towards the end completely added to the terrible movie that is ... Carlito's Path: Rise to Power ..
