Given the history of the director of this film, it is hard to believe that it was such a painful film to stay. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there. He was still watching the movie and, boy, it was for a surprise. I have not read the book on which this is based, and I do not know whether it is highly appreciated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and I realized how badly it was adapted for the screen and how bad it was film, I can only assume that something similar happened here. The act was not bad, although there was a couple - too many eyebrows raised from Farrell. Frankly, I can not believe how little I cared about any character in this movie. Situations take place on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. Donald Sutherland is part of a few scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I looked at my watch when I did not return to the dialogue on the screen. I never went to a movie, but I was tempted to start this time. I gave this movie a "2" score for reasons I find terribly superficial, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the scene of the very short earthquake and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can not say anything positive about this movie. He does not ask for dust, he can not speak!
