This movie is just stupid. Since casting Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer at the fatal climax, the film is an exercise in predictability of wood. Mike Hammer is one of the real sociopaths of detective fiction. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put together pieces to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a target by surrounding him with the bad guys who are ... well, too stupid to get rid of anything. One is so poorly drawn that he falls in front of a popcorn attack. Other parts of the movie are from the Three Stooges game card. Velda's dance from barracks, for example, or the bad guy who accidentally cursed his boss in the back. And the breaks of continuity are shameful: Frau Blucher runs on the central line of the road when the camera is tightened on her lower legs, but she moves laterally when the camera retracts for a wider shot. The worst pause, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The evil man following Hammer passes a second clock after our hero, except that the clock shows it was seven minutes behind our guy. To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and illumination, and the big final is so bad that it was seen, which is the only reason it gets from the two points out of 10.
