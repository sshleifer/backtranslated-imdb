The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is well done. He did not fall. The following good things are the supporting performances of the actor who plays Edward-Gray, always the wonderful Holland Taylor and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor who contributes to criticizing Messing's potential in an early stage brings a delightful, absurd yet winning quality. Okay, it's the positive side. Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is much more faithful expressing his contempt for Messing than in any scene in which he tries to be either business or support. As the others have said, he does not seem to have any emotional investment in this business than to embrace it as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, is trying frankly to transmit the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. It's enough to do this, but it's simply not an actress strong enough to shoot all these things without help. Give him an "E" for effort and a "C +" for accomplishment. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that would have helped Messing would have been a brilliant interpretation of Irons-esquire cavalier from the actor who played former fianc√©e Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, kneeling and disturbing. If I tried to further analyze this, obviously I would have paid more attention than most of the people involved. It is harmless enough to pass the time if you have nothing to do and less inappropriate (and less creative) than the Wedding Singer, but you are better off to watch again the "Wedding of My Best Friend".
