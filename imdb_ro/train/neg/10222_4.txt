Apart from the great cinematography of the wonderful James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real stinker. This is the second film I've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It was so terrible that I closed it. I'm afraid it's not much better. Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the 1937 standards, but when compared to a Helen Mirren, there is absolutely no match. Roboticly, Robson says his lines. His message of fighting to the English troops is so lacking in spirit. Even a cute Laurence Olivier can not save this bored piece. The future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here, and she does not really convey anything here. To think, that Scarlett was 2 years later! It's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made to be so boring in this movie.
