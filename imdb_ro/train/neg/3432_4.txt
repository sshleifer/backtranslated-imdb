A murder killer, cannibal is killed by a mad policeman instead of his last murder. A cult was gathered in his grave with intent to raise him through the peaks in the grave. Of course, it works and he wakes up by breaking the boys' penis and returning to his old ways of killing with a new look of zombie. The two cops, one of those who are a little crazy about garbage in the city and have a drug problem, are returning to the case. Two members of the original cult also try to stop the killer by resurrecting another kind of dead work. Thinking they had deposited, they leave, but there comes a plastic baby doll from the tomb that was used in the initial resurrection. It sounds a little bit confusing, but it's not just its trash. The act is terrible, and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the girls of the gore series and is just as terrible as an annoying cop in this movie. The other cop strives to take his terrible lines. Now, I'm all for low budget cinema, but this movie is just terrible. If it were not for their very ladies and their nakedness, I would probably have been asleep. There's a little gore, but it's never more than some animal intestines placed on the stomach of the victims. Zombie makeup, on the other hand, looks great and the long leg of the foot he uses to rape his victims is sometimes funny sometimes. There is also a half decent scene in which the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The chipmunks doll is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The end is extremely bad. You would expect the murderer to do more than he did. God knows how they made enough money to make a follow-up. <br /> <br /> 4/10
