I tried to watch this abomination of cinema when I was five years old; I have never been the same. Filled at the edge of drug-induced images, which create common ravings for average asylum seekers, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, especially for children. <br /> <br /> He starts out quite innocent with a poor boy who ruins his colleague's drum (wait), putting his head through him; yes, putting HEAD through it. But fear not, friends! He is quickly consoled by his quirky whistle, which is quite odd, I will give you, but still acceptable. The film turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are, but loses all the "hot and blurry" aspects of either of these two books. So, this seven-foot-yellow-haired relative, Barney, is friends with this poor boy and shakes him deeper into despair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In order to add a beautiful range of horrible themes, a carnivorous boat, a former friend of the crew full of feeding the watches of the grandfather and the dragons, adds to the chaos mix . The most refreshing picture in the midst of this chaos is the negative character called "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to do with a broom, whose gas level always seemed to be the smallest in the most inopportune moments. As a result, one of her favorite activities was the nose-sinking into the body of water that separated Pufnstuf from her degenerate and degrading site (I do not know where I'd prefer to live). In the end, this movie is terrible ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience like The Exorcist, then it's for you. you.
