Following his long title, the film finds ways to get closer to the 90-year mark. The beautiful sets are here with everything that made the Hamer's values ​​a trademark, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent negligence. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words, so nothing comes unexpected and nothing deserves more than 5% of your expected attention. The direction is cumbersome as a direct transfer from the actors are mostly rigid as wax figures (this is a Hamer feature, but sometimes it is better presented in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is garbage, it's not worth the time spent that night. Eternal life is a boring issue, and I should have hoped that the guys in the Cinemathèque program would have known better.
