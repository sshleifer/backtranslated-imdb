Direction must be the problem here. I heard John Cleese talking to work for a sketch for Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too thin and not funny. The second branch was too rigid to be fun. The third was thin enough to be funny. This kind of attention to details is missing from "Corky Romano". No matter how unpleasant it was a little comic, it was not fixed and was not left on the floor. The only value I find in this movie is like a study of a very erroneous film that somehow escaped in the distribution without being repaired. I've scanned some other reviews here. The number of reviews that praise this absolute loss of time makes me worse about the suspicion that some people are paying to promote titles. I can not understand how someone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money from it, it qualifies as much as the average. This makes my list of the worst movies of all time. And, hey, I really liked the Three Stoogi and even tolerate Ed Wood!
