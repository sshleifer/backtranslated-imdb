I came here for a review last night before deciding what television movie to set before him, and those I found did make it look unchanged. How deceptively I feel! <br /> <br /> First of all, it has to be emphasized that it is very much a woman's home movie. The performances are wooden, every phrase is an attempt to lose their lives in the way the housewives' housewives and the malicious soaps are always, and rely on that predictable and well-presumed premise that men (especially soldiers) are uncompromised. The whole movie is about "drama" apparently in moments when men are threatening to develop a second dimension. If it sounds tolerable (or even pleasant) for you, then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German meaning, while she's good enough, is painfully distracting - like her face for some reason. The other performances are undoubtedly a source of lasting embarrassment for their perpetrators, the thin and obvious painful characterizations being the order of the day. There are few surprises, but look at the endless supply of food and drink "Monty Pythonesque", which miraculously appears in the backpacks of hungry soldiers! I did not expect action, but I was looking forward to being nice or textually or emotionally loaded. What I received was a particularly bad Christmas story that will have an intelligent audience that will turn around the crapulence of everyone. Watch it in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are a fan of the predictable "housewife takes men and wins" TV movies. 3: The only way to appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have filled enough that your emotions can be easily moved by unsophisticated stories.
