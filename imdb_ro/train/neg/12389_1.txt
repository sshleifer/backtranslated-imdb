Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a professor (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is sued, but it is completely free. He then raped Kathy! Vicious and ill ill. This film was published as an important drama about rape. What it is is a seriously written drama and (to a large extent) bad. She claims to be sympathetic to the rape victim, but she pushes the scene in front of us. To be completely honest, however, Hemingway's act is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it could have. The test scenes were boring and predictable. And the film went too far when Mariel for 15 years was raped (fortunately he was not shown). I admit, however, that it led to a wonderful end when Margaux took a gun and shot Sarandon dead. But seriously - having a young man raped is just revolting. Action does not help. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and a real model I think), but her action left much to be desired. It lowers the movie. Mariel was fine, but this was one of his first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. He was not bad, but the terrible scenario worked against him. I remember hearing that at an examination of this in 1976 some women got up and cheered when Sarandon was killed, so maybe this works for some people. I found this boring, simplistic and even sick. 1 all the way.
