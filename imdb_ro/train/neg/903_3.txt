1937 "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck did not get old - as someone thinks a semi-updated version of the story would work now, it's a real puzzle. Maybe they thought Bette Midler could do something out of her, but this terrible scenario defeats her. I'm paying for a female barman who has a baby out of wedlock and for many years gives the child a rich father to the girl, so she'll have a better life, she can not get rid of traps and old-fashioned feelings. Midler works best with a film director who can control his excesses, but this is not the case here; Stephen Collins is strident as the life changer, but Trini Alvarado is well prepared as Midler's daughter. It was called "a woman's image," but it does not pass, because it remains too faithful to the origin of the 1930s. * 1/2 from ****
