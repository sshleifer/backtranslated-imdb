I passed this title 15 or 20 times in Blockbuster, looking for something decent to see. All I can say is that all were decent movies halfway through the night I chose to rent it. I'll give her credit for leaps and bounds better than "Dracula 3000", but in reality that's pretty easy to say since he did not have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things that are missing are: an interesting distribution, an interesting story, a good dialogue and originality, but I assume you can not have everything. *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... go to the figure), flew from a mining colony to a mining colony, trying to destroy all the vampires that He could find them. The crew consists of: the undefiled captain who died earlier, the one who died, the one who never experienced the first vampire vampire (not a tipo), a cowboy and a very powerful, ", feminine ... looks almost like a distribution for MTV's" Real World ". After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a lot of blood (and, as it turns out, the lovers of the finest parts of human anatomy), his first partner takes over ... blah blah blah ... all hate him .. bla, bla, bla ... I could continue, but as I said it is the same story used in about one hundred other "movies" of the genre. The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a guy) has been hot enough, but of course, if you wait to expose more than just cracking it, look elsewhere. I can not say it was the worst movie I've ever seen, just like I hired "Troopers 2 Starship 2", but wait for it to come on the Sci-Fi Channel.
