The central theme of this film seems to be confusing, as the relationship, setting, act and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to have come out of his element and has no clear, straightforward direction and intensity. To make things worse, the name of his character is "Che", and we are told (directly by the narrator) that the film is not the "chei" Che, just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation in America. So, clich. Other reviews discuss how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; however, the political position of the director is at best cloudy and we are never sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (earned through gambling profits) - so what? Refusing to take a political stance when making a film about the Cuban revolution is a weird and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who it is - we are "introduced" to them all in the beginning - a cheap way to make clear relationships throughout the movie! The act was largely superficial, wooden, and unbelievable, the timing was at your ease. The special visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and to the black character of the Greek choir - are strictly free, intellectually flashy and consistently out of place. I just watched the whole movie because I was expecting clarity or a point at all. It never happened.
