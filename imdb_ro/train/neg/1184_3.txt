this movie had a pretty good plot, but the paste was very slow ... really slow. even if someone thinks this is a classic cult, I think there are much better movies of that era to be watched. cinema is not great, but not the worst. the sounds are OK. lighting is okay. <br /> <br /> I still would not recommend anyone other than a movie student. the movie does not contain music, and the horses that do sex do not - Also do it good. and the woman who masturbates on the edge of the bed was simple. <br /> <br /> No win here, skip this total boredom. I've seen it worse to believe, but that's just a waste of time and I'm not getting good reviews here. especially high ratings ...
