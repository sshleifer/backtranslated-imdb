STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Only Miss the Mark *** This Little Bit In Between ** Going behind * The Pit <br /> <br /> In this debut effort for Nick Park's lover and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon, when old old Wallace drips out of the cheese. Besides being the shortest feature in only 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the oldest and looks somehow. The plasticine animation is a little weird and funny, reminiscent of Mork's animation about the little man in the box. Admirable, though the craft behind her is, I have never been of great importance Wallace & Gromit (maybe a little too pure and traditional for someone in my generation.) The only thing I liked is the heavy pants (and that's it was more than ever since we were younger and less aware of, say, the pleasures of the seed of life). I was led to actively seek this early effort, due to the reappearance in popularity, due to the recent adaptability of extremely successful film. Because they are technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!), It does not have the emotional angle you are going to have successors. That being said, it's a pretty good fun as a first try and you certainly set the standard for bigger things to come. Two stars, but two good. **
