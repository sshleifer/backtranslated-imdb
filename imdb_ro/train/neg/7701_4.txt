The original show was much better. He should have left a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, extremely dramatic, and the funny parts were too far between them to drive away their weakness. This movie seemed to be trying too hard to be serious, and it certainly was not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention, that for a long time was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. So, I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just a little boring, and not so funny. Sorry. 4/10 stars is. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
