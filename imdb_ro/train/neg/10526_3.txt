Careful girls' emotions to reform, playing a kind of closed film. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck there after running away from his abusive father. Once in de facto prison, she is raped by fellow "inmates". Excessive (even at 98 minutes), with a completely useless ending that makes the whole movie look useless. /> <br /> Linda Blair, 15, does everything she needs to avoid showing her body when she's naked, but she drops a nipple shot during a shower scene. 1/2 of *** *
