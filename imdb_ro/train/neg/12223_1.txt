I remember when this piece of garbage appeared, all the newspapers complained about the way she had taken Barbra Streisand for years to make the film. Well, it could not have taken so many years; the play was opened only in 1975, eight years ago. He made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who should probably have been shot in the movie, but NOOOOO ... The big STAR BARBRA should have done it. AND MUSIC WITH NO MORE! This movie is a complete disaster from beginning to end. In a way, Barbra was 40 years old when she did, and she looks every minute. No one could swallow her like a young woman who wanted to study the Torah. And when he dresses like a boy, he gets campy. I have the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive, so she played with makeup; she is more beautiful than a boy than she is like a girl. And as if she were not bad enough she gets involved with her partner, Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best shot is shot at his naked back end), and her fianc√© (Amy Irving, who does her routine the usual sleepwalker, schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; I do not even bother to mention the scene of the "wedding night". Then there is music. Nine totally forgotten songs, all sung by Streisand through voice-over (perhaps a look in her mind), and each as intrusive and irritating as the nails on a blackboard. I will not say that Streisand does not show a promise of promise here; some of the images are great (especially Patinkin's back) and have a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that it will not come out of its own way. I did not believe it for a second in the lead role; she should NOT have added the songs and, moreover, all the misery continues for two hours and fifteen minutes. I'm sick of all the mess in forty-five minutes. Great, terrible, terrible.
