A very shameful and dull movie, with the intention of being hip and modern, shown in the editing style and strange camera angles, resulting only in drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The tower is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing he deserves is Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, very cool and also the opening, very original and exciting sequence. <br /> <br /> Run away if you can, bad opinions and comments about this movie are totally worthwhile; it's really pure garbage. Of course this has its charm to watch a movie that everyone would not let him drink the beer if it was in the fire but save it for a stormy day in which you have absolutely nothing else made.
