Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A biangle love, (I'm sorry for the poetic license, but it's not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately, badly said. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes good, the image seems narrow and narrow. The sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help. About acting ... I'm sorry, but the best actress is the house. Others act immaturally and can not convince the viewer. The actor is poetic when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetic. It's an adult image told by children. It only bothers you if it's very curious.
