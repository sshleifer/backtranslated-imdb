Well, I just ordered this pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit, I've been chuckling a few times, but I do not even remember where they were. I do not understand why this movie was made. It's supposed to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a penis singing or a naked 70-year-old woman very funny. This movie has been tried to fit in the "rough" comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but has just failed miserably. It was much harder than it was a comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought she was sexy, enjoyable and well done. Besides, avoid this movie. 3/10
