This is a film based exclusively on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. This is. Dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of "sexual scenes" is absolutely absent. Action and dialogue are more suited to high school students, but the subject is for the adult audience. It's a great movie and a bit superficial. It could have been much better if it had a story and more drama. Ah, and above, one more thing: why are my monologues so excessive? It seems so cheap. In a movie so embarrassing for Romanian cinema, as well as for the mature audience, who is trying to look at it. I know that the means are limited, but that's not always an excuse for a flopping movie as it does. start using some good actors in your movies and stop them from recycling from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
