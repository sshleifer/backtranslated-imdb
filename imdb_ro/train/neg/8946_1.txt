I think the fires and lighting were very weak. When I looked at it for the first time, I thought it was the old version (1956). When I learned the real year of the movie, I was shocked. I did not know it could be such a bad movie made so recently. That's what I really meant. This movie had a good plot, however, nothing you can not lose if you simply read the novel written by George Orwelll. All I want to say is already said, except for this: I can not believe that this film could have received as many awards and nominations. I gave this movie one (terrible), because I felt it was very badly done. Well, that's all. So long
