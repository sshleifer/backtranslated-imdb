15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that flourished the nations, especially those of the youth. When I was a 3-year-old child living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe for me when I watched with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a Power Rangers "Balikbayan" box (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and Rangers stuffed toys). I even played video games and I loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was TRUTH REALITY. Anyway, it was the show that set a milestone in my interest for the robot series (especially the anime mech series, such as "Gundam") Now when I am 18 years old, I would like to think this show is pretty cheese for me now. To prove this, we made a memory trip by buying a 2-DVD collection of DVDs with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers" and we both watched. I was like, "Ugh, how terrible, just another junk in the attic for me." For all of you people in my generation, this is NOT a show you always want to watch. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers," I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (alias Ninja Robots), or even Sentai ORIGINAL show that they were the "Power Rangers."
