My wife and I thought that along with this cast and director, the movie should be at least worth it. I was wrong. Actually, I dropped it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but talking with American accents was, for me, impossible to pass - hard to believe that England is when no one speaks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to equate a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare love for each other for no reason is ridiculous. There's no reason to care about any of the characters, so I dropped the towel halfway. It was hard for me to think that Hawks was doing this because none of the actors were talking to Hawksian delivery rat-a-tat. So save your time and skip it.
