I like movies and I'm going to watch any movie all the way, just to give a chance. Finally, I can say that I found a movie that I can not follow all the time. The act is terribly obsolete and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer geek did it in the mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... long scenes of just ... walking !!! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG !!! I did not even do it for 15 minutes until I repeat the DVD. Scenes with strangers are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the World," allows you to call this "Long Distance Walking War". This cost $ 5 million to do! What do the money spend, the opening song dramatically? Oh, but with a positive note, a scene you have to watch is when strangers start killing people. This is hilarious, not because people die, but because when they return to skeletons, they continue to shake for 20 seconds afterwards. As I said, if you're a fan of the boring, old, no action, movie, here's a DVD collection for you. But I did not write this for you, I wrote that for billions and billions of other people who will kill this movie. It's not worth your time or money. I know it's book, but the book is not that long and I'm a complete worm / card / geek / anything, but why? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than that! <br /> <br /> I give myself a ZERO BIG, FAT, out of 10.
