I will try to use words to describe this on ... I saw the original, which was good in his own way, but since then I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was "afraid" when I chose him, but now that I have seen him, I have to say that it's even worse than I thought. Why these movies still receive money makes me move. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they're not that good, but it has to be said that some of the heads are turning away simply by being terrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this. It tries to be a copy of the original only when the places have changed, any form of story has disappeared, and any attempt to come up with something that has not been done before, miserably fails. In an unnecessary attempt to get it up-to-date, they try to do this exciting by making use of the whole theme of the "big brother," but which has been exhausted ages ago and offers only a filling from the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the film by making a ton of references to the original of '83, but it just came to be simply fun and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing and I do not want to do anything ... look at her or play Frisbee ... with the DVD ... by myself. Will offer the same fun. Promise
