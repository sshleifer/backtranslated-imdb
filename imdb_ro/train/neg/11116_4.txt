This woman who works internally for a photographer goes home and bathes where she finds this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor over her is a photographer. This movie might have a wonderful plot, but then the plot is leaking out of hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is sniffing heroin. If they took scenes in which someone was sniffing heroin, then it would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really unhelpful to have so much drug use in a movie. He drew attention from the main plot and a wonderful story about a photographer. Lesbian things have not bothered me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
