The Cowboys could leave you in the saddle. Definitely not one of John's best movies. Do not get me wrong, with any move by John Wayne there are always good points. And that has a fair share. But all over the image it moves slowly and does not rise to the aspirations it could have. Bruce Dern has a remarkable job as a bastard. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The kids in the movie were mediocre, but they could have been better off. This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen years old films. <br /> <br /> This would be a good family move to watch with your kids. Just keep in mind that there are a few scenes you might want to take a look at before letting the little ones see them. But most of the kids I know have seen the movie like that. Perhaps because they get to see kids of their age do all their work.
