My dear Lord, what movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those effect fanatics, but I was really thinking that this overlap was a practice of the past, especially of the 1960s. For some time I thought he could record this movie a long time ago and took them forever to cut and release him. But as far as I know, they did not have mobile phones in the 60s ... What I'm looking for in movies is basically a good story with a very good message. The action is secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not mind even a few inconsistencies. However, in a movie like this bad action, incredible, etc., is added to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me with Celestina Prophecy. My wife said the book was really good, and even if I'm not in all those spiritual things, I can see how it can be brought in a credible way - the movie did not do that. There could only be one reason to watch this. If you really like cheese movies, it will be the right one for you. If the IMDB stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, you MUST have rated this movie ten stars. By the way, three stars are because there are worse movies there, such as "Mass Critical" (look for comments on that - hilarious). The Celestine prophecy is at least fun to a certain extent.
