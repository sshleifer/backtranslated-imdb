As someone else mentioned, start with a strange prologue about a little blonde that kills a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and make a trip to the mountains. First of all, they spend the night in an inn where the light-hearted owner becomes prominent, with increased public irritation, by Gaffari. Once again a shelter is sought out in the mountains and they are invited by a very old lady who seems too hospitable to the aliens (Hansel and Gretel, whoever?) What will happen next, I will go for the bold spectator. Now, I love Eurohorror, and this would have been better if only Artigot (writer and director) had tried to logically logic. The Pyrenees? It makes a great and interesting location for mysterious and occult events. The green peaks could easily see the supernatural forces and those who command them. The photo is nice. I just want everything to make sense. You can watch this movie at archive.org.
