This is one of the worst cases of film shooting I have seen for a long time. It's so terrible, I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. Crying is the real problem and I'm sorry for "Sly," as he does a decent performance for his role. But that plot ... Oh dear, dear. I especially love the path next to the end he manages to pick from a mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on the way. A day or two climb takes him to five minutes! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Aside from the gloomy opening (which even a year of five years would be able to predict the outcome), the rest is embarrassed. I'm sorry, but that's just as bad as the movie.
