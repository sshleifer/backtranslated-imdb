What can I say??? This movie was so Dumb & Stupid I thought it was a psychotic comedy DRAG - You should renaming it "Bitching Cat Cat Fight!" What a Time Loss If You Want To See (JUST DIE! "WANT BABY DRAG QUEEN") Jennifer Tilly being her Freaky self, then just rented one of the movie "Chucky", oh ya, "The Bride Chucky" It's More Fun you look at the two Ugly plastic dolls (one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into the UGLY Chucky feminine version) with a brilliant rubber plastic sex, then look at Daryl Hannah being pregnant, rough and bad; Husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do House Work! OK is just stupid!
