The film started strong, LL Cool J (Act) as an undercover police officer, with Sgt partner. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from Practice, possibly mischief as a bad guy?) Who commit robbery and killing. The deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which creates the controversy of a dirty policeman with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey and others) are well distributed and the film shows the promise. The movie begins to be short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the possibility of making a good movie that people will see repeatedly, or one that the teenage girls will go and see once because of Timberlake, I would pick the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard on their job; Timberlake is NOT talented and no hard work can save him. I would have thought he would make a better show, having been acting gifted for years. All he did in this movie was unconvincing. Just because the singer sells millions of records and sells stadiums, it does not automatically mean that they can act successfully in feature films. Even N'Sync hardcore fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of talent to act. Besides, there are some plot holes, like Pollack's snap's sniper's ability and the moral operation of storage machines. This movie had such a promise. Very disappointing.
