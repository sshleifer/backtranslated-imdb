You know a movie is bad, when its climax is able to see a short moment of "Jeopardy!". The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that he had great potential. For some years, I have lived in the area quite similar to the one presented in this film; racial tensions have been raised, and basketball has meant everything to everyone. A movie about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the poor media scenario and poor screenplay of White Men can not leave anything to be desired. The event series of the movie is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money by playing a basketball game. Then he returns home and stretches with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories amount to a climax, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this repeat (this case being "Billy wins or loses money by playing a basketball game"). For a plot to develop, a certain dilemma needs to be solved; and this dilemma should be interesting if the movie is interesting. It seems that the White Men Can not Jump writers have forgotten this rule, because the plot can be summed up as "Billy has to pay the bills". I appreciated the change of pace with other formalized sports movies, but - I'm sorry - it was just terrible. I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a successful movie. It seems that some fans of sport will reject the terrible writing for some scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, were attracted by the big names who played the main roles. This leaves me wondering if the cast has been replaced entirely by previously unknown actors and the theme of the basketball has been replaced with a lacrosse, would anyone have bothered this film? I really do not believe that. I will give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for "Jeopardy!" scene that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
