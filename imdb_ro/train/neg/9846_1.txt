You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. It would be a mistake. This is one of the most harmless films ever made. I've always waited for something fun to happen, but there's nothing funny about this movie. Even the film industry admitted that it was a very poor film and did not even try to promote it. It's a miracle that has ever been put on the video. I wonder what kind of contract has caused vendors to be in this movie. I also wonder why they allowed people responsible for this movie to continue making some bad movies. Of course, this movie is a waste of the money you use to create it, and a waste of time for anyone watching it. Of course, there are high school students who could write / create a movie that would be a plot.
