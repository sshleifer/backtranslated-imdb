Pretty good movie, but not a real story. Rubin "The Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a crime and was never found guilty. The state of New Jersey just did not go for the third time after 20 years. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass a lie test and go free." He did not. This movie should never have been done, but talk about money. A lot of people have unjustly spent their lives in prison and, of course, more blacks than the white ones. Why choose a fake story? Jens
