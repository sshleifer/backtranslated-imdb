This awesome movie assembles any Asian stereotype that you can imagine in a single hideous package. Breaking the money, deceived Japanese businessmen, sending the lusty policeman, Pat Morita, to recover Detroit industrial secrets. Here he meets Jay Leno, who immediately refers to a crime victim as a Japanese and calls Morita Tojo. Everything's down there.
