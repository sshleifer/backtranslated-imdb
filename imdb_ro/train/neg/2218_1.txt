I admit that my review is from the point of view of 2006, almost 30 years after this film was made and at the time of its conception, maybe it was a horror movie / thriller. <br /> <br /> Beginning with Halloween in 1968, Michael, six, commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is employed in a mental institution and after 15 years he escapes and returns to his hometown to kill again. From this point it is clear that the film will follow a fundamental and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of each scene is easy to predict in the way it ends, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the killer) is exactly the same throughout the movie, thus running the spectator to the likely events to follow. For the awful enthusiast / thriller, there is a severe lack of blood / gore compared to modern movies, although they are not similar to the amount displayed on this day and age. A happy environment could have been found. From half an hour in the movie, no scene is unexpected. Action for a horror / thriller film is quite typical for the epoch and therefore has no fist for the enthusiast of the modern day. A positive film is its persistent room photos and dark enlightenment that creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive thing is the character of Michael's doctor, which gives clues about the probability of the place where the story can lead. However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is at the infancy of his acting career and thus fails to offer a truly frightened central victim. It's hard for me to evaluate this movie as it was in its days, but from other horror / thriller movies really in the '80s and to a lesser extent in the 1990's it's a lot less than a movie great / thriller really great. I suggested that you move and find a classic from the '80s. Luck!
