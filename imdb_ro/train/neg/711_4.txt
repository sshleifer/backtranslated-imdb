I'm not sure this is a spoiler; maybe it's a public service. If you are one of those people who are focused on instantaneous satisfaction, who will bounce over the final credits, you will lose the final line of the final news creditors who say that the US has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 until the end of the -WWII . Here are just a few of the issues that come close to you: 1) The elderly person must realize the equivalent of two or three UNHOLY movies in the minds of their minds to fill the gaping gap between film events and this surprise. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person will notice that he has not "watched" one of these UNHOLY fill-in-the-blanks movies in their own free time expelling time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store (or cable). 3) This ending sequel of newsletters' imagery bulletins may be the first information that some younger viewers are exposed to World War II, leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the last heir to the Nazi throne.
