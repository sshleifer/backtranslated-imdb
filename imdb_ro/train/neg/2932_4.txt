Not that he cares, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I had been there, there is a good chance if we continue to make clay as this. The problem is that he found a successful formula like the usual type of guy like Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc but starts to wear thin. Here his character has no discerning qualities, is rude and unpleasant and thinks it's funny when he's not honest. When he was transferred to New York in London (and I suppose this connection is meant to attract viewers from both sides of the Atlantic), he proves to be as untouched as new colleagues. However, it is surprising that, among his Jesuits, he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting, a vengeance for his boss. However, Kirsten Dunst begins to warm himself up to him, even though he did nothing nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, he's at first sight for Megan Fox, probably because her character is just as superficial as his. Everything makes a predictable movie conclusion, although I do not see any spectator expressing how their life has been reflected. The shame is that on paper this is a piece that is supposed to be worth watching. However, Pegg is playing, Kirsten Dunst seems to be moving through motion without creating chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not at all stretched. The only big plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's tenant in New York - now if it was more on the screen .....
