If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini-series, he would have been crying. This was a total loss of time and money. I have read the book and even if the movies are not exactly what the book can be, CBS has scattered time and money in this sense and it is embarrassing to argue that Ludlum's work was possible. check the identity of Bourne with Richard Chamberlain and see how well the television series was. Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica, and Colm, why did they sign up for this escape? <br /> <br />
