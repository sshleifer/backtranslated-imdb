Van Dien must cling to shame in the memory of this absurdly poor film, as must every individual involved. To be honest, I am quite embarrassed to admit that I have looked from start to finish. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original "Crossroads" and "Prisoner Cell Block H" series. Most five-year-olds could come up with a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. In terms of performance, if you can imagine the biggest porno garbage you've ever seen - one of those in which the action is adorned with an endless "story" to explain how some elders with heat peroxide have become spit - roasted with few mustaches - you will have an idea of ​​the standard to act in "Maiden Voyage". Worse, you can not even advance to sexual scenes, because it does not exist. A terribly horrible film.
