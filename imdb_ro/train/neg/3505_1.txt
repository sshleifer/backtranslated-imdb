The Central Comedy has the habit of launching occasional programs - the Chappelle show, the Daily Show, Colbert Report, and then those that some people love or hate - Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some performances that have their defenders, but they are simply terrible - Mencia and now Sarah Silverman. This performance is based on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (Colbert Report), but it can be horrible (Mencia's Mind). It should not shock anyone who think this is the case. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program so absurd that it is lost in its absurdity and is simply not funny. A farting woman has been made in comedy many times because it's not commonplace. We do not need 25 minutes. When a killer is disarmed by a queue, he simply loses his appeal - I saw her in Jay and Silent Bob Strike back, except that the women were warmer and the whole scene was more absurd, making her better. But the best comparison of this show is for Stella, except that Stella was more subtle, which made the absurd comedy fun. She had a better attitude, and I think, a bit more of a realistic fantastic view. Maybe the fact that some reviews are so negative (I am very skeptical of critical appreciation but do not question the fan reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, very inappropriate ads through many advertising programs far away for other programs. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career, and others are still bitter when better performances have been canceled. This show should never have gone over the pilot stage. Back to Norm have shown a lot more promises, but this show does it further. And, as far as the critics were right, many things were universally nicknamed they saw their status grow greatly. Last time I also checked, Britney Spears gets good reviews. Take this comparison anyway you want, because someone will no doubt accuse me of being psychoped on IMDb because I do not like this show.
