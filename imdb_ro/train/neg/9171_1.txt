What can I say? I ignored the reviews and went to see him. Hell, the reviews were so good. What loss of money is the budget. <br /> <br /> Okay, I went to see Kill Bill after that. To see a really scary film, it would be Crossroads! </ br /> <br /> Bottom line - I like "Girl in gold boots" better than these shit.
