The only good part of this movie is the beautiful landscape. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have withdrawn from the pulpit when his son, Paul, distanced himself from the teachings he had proclaimed. How many times do his boys take in vain the name of the Lord in this movie being from a presbyterian setting? It does not match. I wanted Paul to have been swept along the river without a boat from the very beginning to lose Paul's stupid, selfish and selfish story (Brad Pitt). So, Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive player Norm wants to save, but not so. It's very uninteresting. We see that white prejudices have arisen from Paul because of his American face. This was the only part that had an interest and perhaps it could have been developed into a true "wild west". What we see is only a sleepy city where the sons of the two ministers have nothing to do but 1. Norma follows a torturing girl and deals with her family and 2. She makes stupid stories in the newspaper store while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I prefer to watch a show about fishing again - which will never be.
