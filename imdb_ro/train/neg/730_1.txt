I did not see the first movie and if it does not have a great desire. <br /> <br /> After seeing it a few hours ago, I'm working hard to remember something about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, the main plot seems to be a group of very annoyed people who stay at a house with that old lady on Friday, 13 and are tracked by wood planks. <br /> Some people die, the movie is over, they start a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie as I want compensations for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay Â£ 1 to keep this movie out of my hands ...... oh, wait, I've already given it to a "friend".
