I know the people and made part of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! There are rich children who have no talent and probably just asked Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for a year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and so is the show! This is the most crazy comedy that mixes, even the funny thing I've ever seen. It's so bad that it makes me want to barf it !!! He's so mad that Nickelodeon would ever accept something like that and so stupid! I'm so stupid and weird! I hate them and their shows and I think once Nick realizes how stupid he is, most of all, we hope to get it out!
