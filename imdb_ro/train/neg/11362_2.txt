"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated movie I've seen in a LONG TIME. That's what I've been saying since I got my son to see every animated release in the last 4 years. The story must be generous ... tribune. The voice acting is atrocious, too nice to call. Humor is from the Romper Room. The animation is acceptable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon, but this is released on the big screen, not by cable television. It gets just 2 because it's ok 3-D visual. Some scenes had a slightly stimulating picture, but we've seen much better in the past. I also question the insistence of filmmakers to have characters farther from the screen than in most scenes. While it is interesting at first, it has become exhausting after the third or fourth time. I seemed to realize the indifference of the creators. I will say, however, that it has a very good soundtrack. And for recording, my son was not too crazy about it. Bad movie.
