This series would have been much better if it had done just one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head character needs someone to handle the role of crazy lover, which McShane proved to be able to do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the current Diamond Head, is really so bad in the role. McShane is not as good as the bad tree. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, does not seem to decide if she is the unfortunate victim or the tough woman and ready to fight. He even earned his salary at the end when he had to play the role of his beloved Diamond Head. After seeing an episode or two, I'm not worried about what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate it, but Diamond Head does not give us anything to please. Unfortunately, the type of spies in the 1970s was not the same as in the 1960s.
