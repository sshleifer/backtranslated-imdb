I always thought people were pretty cynical about these old Andy Hardy movies. Some of them were not bad. Modern movie critics are not the ones who usually prefer to ugly, so good two shoe movies like these rarely get praises <br /> <br /> However, I can not even defend this movie. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over the story. Looking at this, you shake your head, ask yourself, "How stupid can you get?" This is more horn than horn, if you know what I mean. It's so horn that I can not understand too many people who stay for the whole hour and a half. The story is essentially "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) who is trying to get out of the jam because he makes a story about getting involved with some dabbling in New York City as if it were the last one. People were much more aware of society in the old days. You hear the term "social-climber" as if you knew rich or beautiful people was the greatest achievement that you could make your life. However, it is a story and an innocent and clean series (half a dozen of Andy Hardy's films have been created) as they might find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket when you sing some songs here and cut your way into Andy's heart. Oh, man, I almost write about it!
