When I rented "Unhinged," I was expecting a gore movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that had been cut off from the theatrical release (now I have serious doubts about being released in the theater). After finishing the movie, I wondered how she could even get a video. The land is as follows: A group of three young women on a car journey take their car in a tree. These women manage to get somehow into a mansion containing an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film is mainly composed of unnecessary scenes that are meant to make the film long enough for release. One of the things that make this dreadful movie is the act. Lisa Munson, who plays the lead character, seems to read his lines on his books. The others who act are bad, but they are not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera's technique. Many photos are taken by the cameras attached to the ceiling. This becomes very annoying as the movie progresses. Besides all this, there are very few gore, which makes the box very deceptive. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this. My Rating: 1 out of 10
