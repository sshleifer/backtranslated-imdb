I saw the movie trailer several times at the theater and I was excited. It looked like a classic action thriller, like those made in the 1990s. It also reminded me of fugitive movies, a cat and mouse trail between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most thriller action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say it's like a TV movie. Not realy. First, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies may be very fun sometimes, but this movie is just the opposite of having a good time. Not elegant at all visually and most importantly, the film's tone is untouched. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consisting of a chase and a clash. Also, these are not great action scenes, but worse is the fact that these action scenes are very inspired as the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very useless. In addition, the president's assassination plot is the most clich√© story of this kind, but they insist on this. And this is not a cat and mouse movie, as it should be. Although, Douglas is very old now, he still has the potential to act in a thriller of action. In the movie, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is also the wrong choice because you feel as if you look at Jack Bauer and somehow his character is one of the reasons that make the movie as a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a weird choice, of course it's too passive or direct in this movie, because she is the soap opera actress. The movie was not fun for even a second for me, so I could not pass for a while.
