For a movie about a killer, this is surprisingly boring. Nothing happens and even when things happen, they do not generate any enthusiasm or real interest. good of the two leaders, Cassetti, in particular, offers a great performance that combines the certainty and stupidity of Succo, but the cast cast also does what they need to. The problem is that there is poor writing and the direction and fact that , as a true story, is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it's not interesting or exciting. Movies of this type normally try to generate tension or empathy or scandal, and this generates nothing but a sense of regret that you have wasted your time watching it.
