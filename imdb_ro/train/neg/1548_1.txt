Lorne Michaels once again proves he has absolutely no film making business. You would think that after such noisy "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" begins to get the idea that maybe he does not know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would say he does not know what he's doing and when it comes to television). Trying to make feature films from skits that were welcomed the third time they were made on SNL makes no sense. I personally like Tim Meadows and I think he would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see a talented guy who was wasted in a movie that is inoperable after an unpleasant situation and covers it with a terrible song and dance scene. Anything laughs here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. Okay, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have movies about them. It is too bad that this has reached the big screen.
