Okay, I honestly do not see why everyone thinks it's so great. Not really. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can make a hat for him. 2. Danny's performance was good. Nothing but it has become pretty bad. And who was Stanley Kubrick thinking about making Shelly like Wendy? It was so bad. He looked the same every time he was scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have had more respect for him if Kubrick had finished it altogether. And, the whole movie was stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was much better. So you do not see the movie read the book and you will be much better. 3/10.
