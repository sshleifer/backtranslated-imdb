Well, I saw last night and the only thing he did not completely terrible is that he was straight ahead. There was no beating around the bush that this child was Antichrist. However, the movie was badly written. For example, they did not explain how the dentist's incident was an "accident" or the end of how the miraculous policeman came to the house in time to save the child without the police being even called. The scenes of death were very bad and they were not fun at all. The kid chose to play Anti-Christ was boring and they really could have chosen a better child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
