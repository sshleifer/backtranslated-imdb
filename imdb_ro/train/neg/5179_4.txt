Without the actual indulgence of the supernatural or motivative nuances of mankind, all this creative team has to say that it is an efficient use of its average, non-original elements. "The Five Party" has become manic, then genetically inaccessible, there is little interest in rooting because the unique non-homicidal element is a "Wes Bentley" type mopper that performs at a secondary speed. In fact, all the acting is profound. Even if dark-haired women call, salaciousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also missing are enough blood buckets. All sensations are kept at a safe distance, safe ... an unfortunate fact, given the given name of the directors, is a "butcher." Only the soundtrack, the wicked foreign country and the tense fluctuating score offer any palpable tension. Sometimes compiled static compositions add attractive appearances that add to the bad state ... but for a horror movie I did not even get close for a moment. Perhaps a greater emphasis on the rejuvenation of society through blood supply, scenes with different geometric shapes out of the market, and a sustained emphasis on the game through family malleability or sympathetic characters who have to escape to escape their dilemma would have improved the view but this was not a good start for my trip through horrorfest.
