This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone gives you this for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a bad person because you know you've seen it. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ... it's driving, working with the room, lighting and sound. there is absolutely nothing to enjoy this movie. who paid to have this movie is broken now. I hope the director does not get the green light for another movie. In his defense, this movie was made quickly to try to take advantage of the actual capture of the BTK killer, but I saw the film of the weeks that seemed Oscar winners compared to that.
