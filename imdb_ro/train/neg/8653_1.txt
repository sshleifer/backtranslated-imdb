I came into this hope that it would be "the thought that provokes" little jewelery people have reviewed this as. I like indy movies and I expect to dig that too. knowing what a hot button these subjects are expected to be really entertained, maybe even see an outlook. All I can say is wow .... if your car torture, or mutilation then you may like this. I personally do not like the idea of ​​being pee'd on or cutting, so I thought it was garbage. bad scenario, bad action, bad story, bad direction, bad editing .... I could go on. I have no idea why a reviewer claimed he made a political point by giving this film a 10th who is deceiving and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb does not set a precedent! it just lets other people believe that a garbage bomb like this is good to look at as long as it's controversial (this movie is not, it's trying very hard to be but it does not succeed). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when it comes to 15 minutes when all the main characters are praying that they die terribly. unfortunately, they die, but not in the painful ways that would have given the viewer a justice or justification because they pursued the two hours of nonsense they just endured. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor, just do not bother. I took this movie in a shopping cart from my local video store for .50 and I feel broken!
