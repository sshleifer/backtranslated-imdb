I can not say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But again, I can not say it is one of the worst I've ever seen. OK, so it's a girl practicing skating is good at it, want to go to an expensive school, can not afford and should take a hockey scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends. Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. She could not complain to save her life, just made noises, like a child who pretends to cry to make his way. Katelin was just an annoying person. The way he tried to act totally nice and useful to people. Also, the part where the two skaters call her name and they say something about her choreographer and she says "tracing the line" made me wander. We all knew where she and Spencer would go. Classically, they did not like each other and gathered at the end was just typical. Generally, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating, but if you do not mind the main skater, it is extremely annoying. It is good to kill practical time.
