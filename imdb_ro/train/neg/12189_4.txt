I am surprised that this movie is rated so strong, although if I go to a typical scale 71 is a c- or d, so maybe it's good, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except the slow and unrealistic boring. Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but this seemed to be trying, and yet the woman who was hit was not accused because she did not want to be examined in court even if she had given the man who broke her arm they beat her up and raped her for life, not just to protect the lawyer she had feelings with and her family, not just the random ones she did not even know. There were other issues similar to the movie, which would have been good if there had been a kind of morality to take on the film but the few moral questions like if it was right to try Kady Kady before to do something illegal was a small part, since Kady became just a crazy bastard bent on revenge, so surely the lawyer was entitled to protect his family since he expected Kady to actually rape him his daughter, in order to do something legal about it would be a little absurd. So now I've cut more of my life for this stupid movie so please do not come it so at least your life will not be waist and in my 2Â½ hours or so it meant something.
