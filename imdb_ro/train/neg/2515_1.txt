This film is an abomination and its realization should have been considered a capital crime. One of the great mysteries of the film is the reason why no one has ever made an honest adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story about a truly captivating mystery, an old love of old fashion, and a dry English humor. Why the producers had to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard cop to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and the cartoon of his English servant, to change the part of the main story about the murder charge and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the accused, etc., etc.? These producers and executives who always think they can do a better story than the one in the book should write the original scenario and not rape the product of another person.
