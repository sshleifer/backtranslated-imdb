I read John Everingham's story a few years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking about what great movie he would do. Probably it would have been if Michael Landon did not get his hands on him. As far as I'm concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license went over the top as well as his massacre in the Little House series of books. The actor, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the screenplay is unwavering, and there are several Landon's scenes of fish than should be allowed. This film reflects Everingham's story as much as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the books on which it is based. It's just another vehicle to show Landons's terrible hair.
