Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible. It has no resemblance to a true human, dead and boring story. It's a Hollywood parody, with musical bands that remind you of a Denzel Washington movie, focuses and focuses, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary photos and gestures of famous people in the clothing catalog. This is done to satisfy the crowd of zombies whose life sense derives from viewing celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the final credit and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot looking at this, save yourself.
