Such a pretentious and tortured attempt to hipness. Diabolic diagram and dialogue and act really embarrassing. Really the worst movie I've ever seen (at the cinema). Nothing in my opinion is saving this movie to be a total disaster. I saw her when she went to a cinema in Brighton. People went out and there were more people talking outside the restrooms than in the room! At the end, there were booms and scornings from the leftist crowd, which was rather sad, as the relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really vagabonds. However, the movie was so bad that I could not really feel sympathetic to them. Everyone has to start somewhere and their son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt of "tarantinism done in the UK". 5 years are gone, but sometimes I'm wandering in the memory of that sad night in movies! This is a movie that has no redeeming aspect! I gave it a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a "shameometer" for all those involved in this evil motion of a movie. I know some of them moved to better things, a positive thing being that none of them could have sank below.
