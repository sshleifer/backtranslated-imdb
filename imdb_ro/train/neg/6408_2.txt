UPA films are surprisingly well-appreciated on IMDb, despite the fact that the animation quality is a few years less than that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Unfortunately, due to the increasing cost of making high-profile cartoons and wonderful backgrounds, the UPA style (which began around 1950) began to dominate in the 1950s and 1960s. After all, the films were dirty to do and they received more Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So, as a result, bad animation became a norm and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. This UPA movie is one of the first. Characters are very simple drawn (any easier and using stick figures) and the background was ugly - simple drawings with colors added in a very poor manner (often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the elements). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz-style attitude. Some will love this, others will find it very, very loud. It's the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and because of the shooting and everyone, it's probably not a great movie for kids. Heck, because of animation and jazz, there is no really good movie for me! Some will read my review and no doubt I think I'm a maneuver (which is, to a certain extent). However, I like animation movies and little of this UPA style minimalist goes in a very, very long way and you can not seriously consider great artwork - drawings very often, very quickly. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - something else!
