Very old film with a horrible dialogue, clich√©-ridden and mawkish and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk overlap constantly. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how catastrophically this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total hole, full of histrions and hysterical shifts. The sound is horrible. Room moves are without imagination, like building characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting photo. Actors smoke constantly and see beer beer ads. Very cheap, indeed. (an exception: Ned Beattie's beautiful and simple way to play the hit man).
