Deadly Wake is the PERFECT film for film students ... to learn how to make a movie! Let's see ... what did the team do in this tab? The worst set of music The worst way of playing Worst scenario MORE DIRECT DIRECTION Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinema Worst props Worst setting Worst illumination Etc Let's face this movie if this movie was black and white, ... it would still be terrible. All scenes are dark (the lights are called "black"), often the musical score drowned the meandering dialogues, which was OK because no one ever spoke two whole phrases without long breaks of effect. The "bad" robot was hilarious ... what was that? Jazz dans? I think it was supposed to go tactic or something like that. I'm sure he hit the fear in the hearts ... poor publishers. And how do you modify so many garbage images? It is not possible. Garbage is garbage no matter how you merge it. How did someone do this by dails ??? The bottom line is ... I could not stand to see more than 15 segments of minutes, it was so bad ... but I saw everything (with lots of lots) just to see if it has any good element in it at all . NOPE! NOT! A perfect example of how not to make a shot ... you have to see for every serious student of the movie!
