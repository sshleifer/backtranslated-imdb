The typical Troma-trash, this thrilling 80-year hit is considered one of the "strengths" of Lloyd Kaufman's notorious production studio, alongside the "Avenger Toxic," released a year earlier. The "Toxic Avenger" is far superior if you ask me, but this detuning is still bearable; Make sure you leave your brain's full capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town proudly claiming to be the toxic chemical capital of the world and certainly not mind. Safety measures in the local nuclear power plant are under-standard, at least (even Homer Simpson has never been this nonchalant), and toxic waste returns to the nearby high school. The first victim was the one who suffered stereotypical poisoning, which began to pull out green things from all its body cavities, but his death is considered an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house! Oh, humanity! Shortly after, however, nuclear leakage affects the planting of weeds in school, and things start to become messy. After smoking a commune in a party, the loveliest couple in school produces a giant worm monster that rests in the basement and feeds on adolescent foam. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is the "bottom-of-the-barrel" horror movie, with so bad dialogues that your ears hurt and makeup effects that give a word completely new to the tasteless word. If you like watching the melting, destroying or splitting faces, this is certainly a must! Unlike "Toxic Avenger," this movie suffers from some really boring and long moments where nothing really significant happens, such as when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what's wrong with the hormones their. Cruel humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger," and acting performances are amateur. Exit only if you are an avid thunder-fanatism.
