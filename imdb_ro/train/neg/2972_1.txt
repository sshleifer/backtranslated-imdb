My teacher recorded this and showed us in Child Care to show that teenage pregnancy affects people. She has just shown how teenage pregnancies affect a childish joker who is not properly educated about how sex works and an angry, sneaky tossing fruit when she is angry and could not say she was with the bad man, if he had a sign that said it was so. I would not be surprised if the child's father had about eight friends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's mother (kid's bearer) is a revolt. She does not take into account the fact that her daughter has passed the age of four and is apparently anxious when people spy on her through her dining table. Bobby's best friend's name is Dewey, and it's an obvious appearance of Sean Penn's character in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thanks to goodwill, it's just for television, limiting the audience's chances of seeing them.
