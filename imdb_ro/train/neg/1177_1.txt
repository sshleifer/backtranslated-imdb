This movie is a complete carp! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, is rambling and incoherent. I'm proud to have installed the depths of the 70-year-old cinema, from Salo to Kitty Salon. I like to be shocked, but I need a coherent story. However, if you look at the riders, you are attracting this movie is for you. The saddest part was the werewolf suit with the functional Wang. I mean, it's hard enough to stay here, not to mention that the acting is terrible and that the soundtrack is dubious. Please know that the cover is interesting (which looks like a handful of gorilla that touches the naked butt of a woman), but do not waste your time or money because you will never come back.
