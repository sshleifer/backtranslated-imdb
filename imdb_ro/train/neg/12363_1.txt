This is one of those films that apparently tried to drive the martial arts madness. Like Billy Jack, I think. However, while Billy Jack had a notable scene in the field of martial arts, there is no one in this regard if you do not consider a gentlemen's problem and duration as such. We are introduced to the star that is described as having learned Judo in the navy. I was in the navy and, while I'm pretty stable in the box, I really do not recall any accent on Judo. As a result, the opponent, James MacArthur, refers to Judo when he gives an excuse for the reason he, a champion of the state champion, was so easily defeated. Lame.
