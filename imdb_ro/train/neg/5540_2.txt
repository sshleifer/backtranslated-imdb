After I saw Revolt Of The Zombies with the award winning Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I was left with a burning question. How has he ever defeated a society that created these ultimate warfare machines? <br /> <br /> This is the question you'll be thinking about if you take the time to watch the zombie revolt. By the end of the First World War, the French discovered a cult of occupied Cambodia, where these amazing creatures, which can not be stopped by bullets, form a brigade of monks that move over and free the Hun. scares the living fecal matter from all over the world, so an international expedition is formed to find out how to destroy the secrets of these zombies so that no nation can take its hands and lead the world. had some dissensions in these lines. The first is Snidely Whiplash villain Roy D'Arcy who kills the Buddhist monk who has the secret, and the second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he is determined to make Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland. I think you have an idea of ​​how it comes out, especially since a race of zombies does not conquer the world for a country. Dean Jagger, when he won the Oscar for "Twelve O'Clock High," must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the terrible dialogue he tried to give him a spark of sincerity. The moral of the story, you could make a final warrior with zombie potion and zombie song, but you can not make a supreme love slave.
