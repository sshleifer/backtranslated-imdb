This movie was terrible to say the least. We were hoping much better after seeing the "Music High School". The whole movie was a complete rupture of "Simple Life", but it was not a realistic show. The act was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not that terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad throughout the course. Chris Gallinger, who played the interest of Amanda's love, played a French guy but had a terrible accent. A good thing about this movie was the adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love. Just something to remember, if this movie was broadcast before "High School Musical", it probably would not have been as bad. But there was no comparison. Generally, I give her a 2.
