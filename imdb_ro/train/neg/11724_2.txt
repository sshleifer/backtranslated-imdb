Once I used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untested movie in which it appears. So now, for the first time, the Snipes-Method of Referral Method method has failed. Vanity. I should have been here for the first time to see these reviews. Snipes should be ashamed to allow his serious efforts to be so wasted in the "Contractor." my worst fears have come to a bitter result. I was afraid that the unclear, unclear, pseudo-documentary, "unthinkable" direction and editing style (for the first time brought to my attention by the bloody Sunday led by Paul Greengrass) could spread to other films. Greengass's heavy models were then brought to new heights in the last two Bourne trilogy films. My fear has happened. In my opinion, these films are really bad made by these motion-causing methods, which are wrong because of unclear movements for "action-amplification." But "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass loves him so much as a cash cow, has persuaded others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in search of quick and big bouquets. Read my lips, Hollywood types. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, not only be suggested by poor and lazy cinema techniques. And "The Contractor" goes so far as to emulate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in repeated bites, hoping their minor audience (apparently assessed) can not notice them. For example, if I hear a police radio that breaks up again "Yankee-Romeo", I'll yell. Chances are good I will not hear again: I will certainly never see the Contractor again. I recommend to those who have not yet seen "The Contractor": just be content with the peace that this lack of life gives to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I am tempted to reduce to 1.
