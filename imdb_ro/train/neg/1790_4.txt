It was a "cute" movie at first, then it became too sappy and featured mediocre songs at its best. There is too much English King James spoken with is not only annoying in today's world, but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine that today's youngsters are trying to listen to this movie? Look. Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is full of "Hank Martin". And Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was in addition to her good looks and beautiful and long, red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie with a good finish and I can not beat it. Perhaps this is worthy of a rental for the sake of history or if you are a big Crosby fan, but generally it is not so much.
