Please have someone stop Ben Stiller from going to any movie. Write the studios, hell, write your local congressman even. I made more laughs at a funeral, then I watched a Stiller movie. Jack Black is trying to do something about a comedy about the disappearance of dog carp, and Christopher Walken, perhaps the greatest of the actors in his generation, seems simply embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unhappy self, but now, even with somebody to save him, he proves he's overrated as a comic. No wonder why this movie was badly cut and was available for dollar cinemas after just a few weeks. I warn you and you have to warn your friends, Do not look at this movie, it's just terrible, worse than Gothika (personally, I never thought to say that), worst Plan 9, Worst Ishtar, worse then the Golden Child. Please, Hollywood, give up Ben Stiller in your movies, it's not funny, he's a terrible God actor, and he's bringing him to him. The next movie was ranked No. 1 because negative scores are not allowed, so while the board says one, I give it a Zero.
