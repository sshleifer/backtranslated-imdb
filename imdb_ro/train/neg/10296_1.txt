Probably it was just my DVD, but I would not recommend someone to try to follow this picture on a DVD. I had to bring my volume to TV at the highest possible level in order to hear about 80% of the dialogue. Some words remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, even if it's thin. People's voices have been drowned by almost all ambient sounds, including unpacking a pack, tracing and even swelling a cigarette. <br /> <br /> With the volume raised to a level where voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene changes in a lively environment such as a disco . And you will hurt diving so the remote will turn it back. There is art and art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, at a time of war, would meet the international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. After about half an hour I gave up, not seeing anything else in the redemption in the picture.
