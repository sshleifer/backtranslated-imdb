The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown showed me my finger on the remote, ready to blow up to watch something else. The premise of two writers, down to their luck, who lived in a "bin" of self-storage space, was slightly funny but painfully smelly. The introduction of the character played by Joe Pantoliano - the great movie guy who lives in the park and sleeps in a toilet, offered hope and decided to give him a few minutes. And then a few until the introduction of Kristy Swansons as a developing film director and nymphomaniac limit, added a little spice. Her solid performance in acting has raised her presence above and beyond just a very good match with candy eyes. Finally, the obviously low budget impact on the film, with poorly shot scenes, moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time were a low budget, Whithnail & I being one who also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck. However, for my money, the actors saved Tinseltown from the "Terrible movie" archives and just push it into the archives "It could have been a cult movie." I laughed aloud at some scenes involving the character of Joe Pantoliano. In particular, penultimate scenes in the strange clich√© house, but still amusing, rich, but cheated, where the story goes to its final moments. I can see how Tinseltown was a great one and while the filmmakers did everything in their power to translate this to celluloid, it simply did not work and while I laughed aloud at some scenarios and gaskets, I think the first 30 minutes have crushed my senses and expectations a degree I would have laughed at. If you are not stuck for a novelty coffee basket, do not take it if you see it in a bargain bucket.
