I do not know about you, but what I like about cartoons Tom and Jerry is the interaction (often violent) between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan he sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an affair in New York, and for me, he certainly suffers from a lack of cat! As magical as Jerry's exploration of "Big Apple" could be for the other T & J fans who commented on IMDb here, I could not wait for this self-indulgent trash to end, so we could follow the next drawing animated on my DVD. In fact, the only part of the whole episode I really liked was when Jerry almost "buys the farm," hanging precariously at the end of a broken candle hundreds of meters above a crowded road.
