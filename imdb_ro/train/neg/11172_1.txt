The most popular popular film of 2002, "I Love the 80's," is a disastrous, idiotic, offensive and disappointing disastrous pop-culture of a show that was the first of a long line of horrific television programs, the last one exposed the end of VH1 at one point the only real music channel left on the TV! I used to live on VH1 basically until spring or winter, watching which ones now, since 2002, when garbage of this kind began to appear without any reason. From pure morbid curiosity (I think that you would have called it), I decided that I would go ahead and take a look - see anyway the first night when it came even if the ads looked like nonsense. At least I can honestly say I was not a little disappointed about it, because my expectations were obviously in the basement at first. The focus of this show I was in the first 5 minutes was lower every year in the 1980s and what was and was not significant from the cultural or popular point of view (what I expected to see) but rather a makeshift platform for a whole host of comedians really unfortunate to show that more than likely I think it is their comedy skills * eyes * Please ... more lack - if you ask me! It is easy enough now to see why nobody ever heard of any of these idiots before they appear on this show, because they are all so terribly unhappy and pathetic in their attempts of so-called "humor" on I swear I could feel my intestines knot with each and every rancid un-liner shot one after the other! Overall, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / is the smallest denominator trash and one of the main reasons I almost never see VH1.
