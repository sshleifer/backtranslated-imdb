This film about the government's mental experiments and the corrupt use of citizens by obscene and thin figures has had the potential of being a truly exciting film. But for me, it failed. I will not elaborate too much on the rather confusing line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user's comment "reluctantpopstar" provides a good description of it. But he did not do it for me. I found it slow, which would be fine, but because it did not seem to go anywhere. The visitor is left in the dark about too many things to be able to really deal with this movie - in some movies, it can be argued that filmmakers intended to provoke thinking and leave things ambiguous for this reason. I do not think this is the case here. As for the frequent photos of two buildings that were frequently mentioned by other users ... they see that they have a point - they give the spectator time to get another drink without losing any of the "actions". And I suspect that many viewers would take the opportunity to have more drinks on board to get through it.
