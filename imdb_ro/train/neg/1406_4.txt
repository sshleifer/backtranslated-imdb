This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview in 2004 that when he makes movies, he feels like he's doing music, and when he makes music, he feels like he's making movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. Kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like the noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like the music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a nice plot. "Promise me this" has no plot. We were waiting for this movie with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica there are "noises," and to my regret, I saw only two dialogues that I could identify as Ranko Bozic wrote. The other part of the script was used by the director to make his chaotic music video for his son Stribor's music. Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scenes for "Gypsies Time" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica is not following the script. The "Black Cat White Cat" was the only scenario, for which Kusturica said he would not touch it. According to Gordan Mihic, after Kusturica returns to the script and if not, does not make a good movie. And I think this is the case with "Promise me this." He should have followed him on the script of Ranko Bozic. "Promise me this" is billed as a "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. Comic moments are in the same style as the "black cat cat white", but they are not at all funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that the "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. However, I know some people who liked "Promise me this", I find a very positive film.
