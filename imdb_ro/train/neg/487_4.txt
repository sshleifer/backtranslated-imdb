What does the director think? Everyone who read Artemisia's biography is left impressed by her courage to face a public rape trial during the Renaissance and even to suffer torture to show that Tassi was guilty. This demonstrates true independence and emancipation - in the worst hour, she represents her man. Why do the films describing the Renaissance have to be both clinically and romantically beautiful, are we afraid to see the stony part of life or if we have Hollywood's happy-happy fortune? While I will always defend the director's freedom to create her own reality in a movie, I can not realize that the story of Artimisia's life is on the head. A very disappointing choice by the producers of this film.
