In general, I do not worry too much about film violence or a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is great with me, and the movie brings us a lot more. There are beautiful pictures of lake and nature in particular, a good set of characters, a good direction. This movie could be voted as a good movie. However, she is spoiled for two reasons and both of these related reasons make this movie simply disgusting. First there is the violence used against the living creatures to make this film. Not the violence of the film, I'm talking about REAL violence. This violence alone can be justified unless this is the second number; the film's message was not just an insight into the twisted relationships of executives with women. Not that we all have no real twists with women (men, for example). But the film's conclusion ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Our "Heroina" finally dies (by my own hand, if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and annoyed me, now the guy is out with a new movie that are with safety will not follow) and is now more clearly described as a kind of natural demon, the nature that grows over them, especially her sex. Of course, the director "kills" the heroine of women. Women have to die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion ** Ultimate spoiler * Well, everything that might be good would have been good if I had managed to keep my point of view. But to use large images, artwork cruelty to living creatures, just to say that men can be frightened by women, and men are cruel to women. It's not enough. I knew when I saw this film that it would get good criticism for "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and anything else. But for me this film is just completely marked.
