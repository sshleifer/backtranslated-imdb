It's interesting at first. A naive park director (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) whom she knows only for a short period of time. They seem happy, then disappear without warning. He looks for him and, after a few endings, he hits a part of his abused childhood and the recent past, which can include criminal activities. And then, it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning, though not as suspenseful as it may seem, is at least noticeable. Then it is no longer interesting or even meaningful. And the end is so bold, so boring and so devoid of any emotion or intelligence, you will think writers do not know what to do with it and get bored trying. What a waste of a good idea!
