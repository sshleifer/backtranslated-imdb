God, was this adaptation of "Run, Lola, Run"? It was terrible. It is quite difficult for the "screenwriter" (and I to use the very poor term) to cut and drop the dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and rush the story: although Anne Elliott runs from location to Wentworth's place near the end of the play was an abomination! Austen must rotate in the tomb. No respectable young man would have acted in an atrocious manner. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remakes are so bad, there will be a new generation of observers. If you want to see an impeccable version of this wonderful novel, you get Roger Michell's 1995 version with Amanda Root (whose expressions can only speak in volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. Is gorgeous.
