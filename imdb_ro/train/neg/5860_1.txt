It is difficult to accurately state the veracity of this film. A completely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of any thing even remotely known as "humor" or even "fun" in the "Rabbit Test". So, as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "terrible"; used to describe overly ambitious dislikes, such as the "Rabbit Test" movie. Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have severely overcome their poor ability to have fun in this 82-minute misfortune festival. Trying to put a plane together! comedy style with a collection of gang bites (Note to Joan: German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville) have disinfected from their graves in Catskills - that's pretty bad. But the composition of this cinematic crime is River's directorial style, which can best be described as "ugly," and a cast of one and the future is so eager to thank overwrite even the weakest of the throats thrown. Adrift in this Sargasso Great Plague is an unfortunate Billy Crystal in his film debut role as Lionel's protagonist of the unfortunate film. Crystal's view of this image is akin to viewing a blind person to take a walk in a minefield; Eventually, the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as a cheap joke after a cheap joke that blows them in front. I can only speculate about the kind of audience that might even like the rabbit test. Lightweight cabbages, mollusks and lizards are probably candidates. But for the people who think of themselves, people think - I would strongly recommend the bleach-pouring of the eye before recommending the "Rabbit Test".
