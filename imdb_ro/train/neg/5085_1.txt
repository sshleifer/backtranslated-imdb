this movie starts with an ordinary funeral ... and insists so much on this funeral I feel I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching and I started jumping scenes. it seems to me that anyone who has made this film is affected as it becomes trapped in a permanent morbid trance, incapable of contemplating anything other than death and destruction. well, I'm not one of the dark kids in Southpark, I want a movie that makes me enter into an interesting story in 10 minutes, I will not sit down and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparation for a funeral. my grandmother in recent years has been fascinated by funerals, maybe he could have enjoyed this "movie".
