Okay, absolutely I like Ben Stiller, though I'm hot about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think this girl can act at least. Every movie or sitcom I've seen is very hard to get over her fake role. She seems to be just there reading the script. This movie had only one good thing about it, and that was Ben Stiller in it. This plot is so used and abused is ridiculous. How many movies have the same type of plot? Can we say "Nature forces?" Not only the plot is so old, but the result is so predictable, it is boring. I knew everything that was going to happen before she did that. It was boring, but watching Stiller is always a delight!
