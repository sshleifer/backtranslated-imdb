the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Austin Film Festival in 2004 and I realized that this film was accepted at a festival. was an interesting concern and seemed to go somewhere, but it just collapsed every time it tried to do something. First of all, if you do a musical, find someone with musical talent. music consisted of a cheese piano game that sounded as if played on the stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terrible, and when there were no obvious lines, there were rhymes that caused the groans to show how far it stretched to try to make this movie work. and you think you'll find people who can play a musical, are not they? not in this case. fortunately, they were half-spoken / half playing in rhyme most of the time, but when they sang, they made me wander. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and that only deals with music. part of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of dialogue was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously did not have enough coverage on the stage or had only a bad editor because they steadily jumped the line and used terrible choices as they cut the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they had added the hook to make music. I hope investors can make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
