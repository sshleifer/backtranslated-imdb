This review is based on the Double Shock-o-Rama video published in a world that does not deserve to be in 2002. How bad is it? It's terrible, which is "1" on the IMDB scale - but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German version could improve things - English-English dubbing is not at all amusing - but frankly, this is one of the most amateur films of any genre that probably you will see it. The film's zombies are as lazy and clumsy as ever and do not seem to have the ability to talk or think of anything beyond the next table. However, they are also intelligent enough to exploit motor saws and bad enough to know that the Western taboos about the genitals will undoubtedly subsist their mass conversation. Romero Romero's Land of Death was a zombie nation that kept a social turn; here, the zombies are nothing more than an empty cloth for the perverse images of director Andreas Schnaas. Extremely, without redeeming his social value and even worse, without entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone losing money on it.
