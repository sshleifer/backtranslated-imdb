Unfortunately, this has been shown on Star movies here in Thailand, in the last week or so. It's a complete garbage that works. As another member said, this movie is a good example of "how not to act". I have not seen a movie so badly driven. Are actors (you can call "actors"?) They are completely full and give their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to really understand how bad the act is, you should see the movie ... but that would be like torture. , and the rest of the cast with accents (false or controversial) is just as bad. Another actress with a fake British accent was pretty, yes, but a good ruler was her terrible accent. Mix with it (lack of) act and you have a disaster. She should have said nothing, and I could have accepted it as a cute girl. Oh, I got to the stage where the lady's friend says, "Really?" after a forced scene from her. Ridiculous. No, really, I laughed aloud. Sets and art directors offer a film to rescue the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some scenes are pretty pretty (minus the actors). The old lady of magic? What the?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Pretty inadequate for a piece set 500 years ago. I understand that the film was considered "Big Budget" in Thailand when it was produced. I would be very upset if I were the producer of this film. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) movie. I would give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make the movie saved from an assessment. 2 out of 10.
