Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic movies because, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this movie does not have in the drama is offset by an overlap of boredom. He does not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be a shallow use of background technology. The scenes in Paris and the French countryside have a quality cardboard in relation to them. It might be better on an empty scene and go that way. One can not expect the amazing effects of the "Flying Punch House" or "Golden Compass", but it is, after all, a digitized production since 2002. The characters seem to enter a scene to enter a scene, so much so that you lose the number of times the character enters and leaves the rooms. In my opinion, this film transforms the French Revolution of the 1790s into the papier-mache revolution of a paper-collector world.
