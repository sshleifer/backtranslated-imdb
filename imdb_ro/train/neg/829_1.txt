I heard about this movie and I knew it was not good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. It could be a very black and black satire on the morals of our day. The little features about each challenged were good. Something is being built that I would not want to lose. But when the so-called show starts everything becomes impossible, cheap and rather stupid. Here's where the writer would have added something that would make people think. But instead, it's wrapped up and assuming people are so stupid. The end is so bad that I give it a 1. Even if the movie starts to promise.
