The first point that draws attention to "Forever Mozart" is the absence of a summary of the plot in IMDb. The explanation is simple, because there is no story, scenario, plot or anything that might recall the minimal structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most exaggerated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry, and this unnecessary shit is among the most hermetic films. I think he himself did not understand what this story is; but there are intellectuals who have elucidated to justify or explain this filthy movie, and it's fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
