Surely NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, swordplay and landscaped cinema you'll probably see, but that's not what makes a good movie. Helps, but the story must shine on these things. And that's where Nomad wanders. The story is crushed, giving him a feeling that he was thrown together to make a "cool" movie that "looks" awesome. Not to mention that many of the main characters do not come from the region where the story unfolds (and obviously with names like Lee and Hernandez). If movie makers want to dress us in a culture like jugglers and kazakii, they use better and better actors / actresses to show the parties. Warrior tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, the love that separates our "heroes," are touched entirely, but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will leave behind in favor of the next sequence battle, the next scene or the amazing beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that during the shootings of Nomad some significant changes were made, especially the director and the cinema. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Serghei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In a sense, Laustsen seems to have a better eye, since his visions of the land have made the end we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, moving to Bodrov as a director may not have been the most wise choice. From what I see here, the emphasis is on the battles and not the people, which I feel is coming from Bodrov's eyes and not from Passer. A real travesty. The most embarrassing thing is that it could have been a truly fantastic movie with both character and action focusing. Unfortunately, the elders seem to have decided that the action was what was needed and took the cheap way (intellectually speaking). Even though I can not give this movie a positive rating, just for amazing cinema work. But that's all.
