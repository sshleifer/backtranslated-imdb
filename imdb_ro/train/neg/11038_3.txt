I have always written this series as a furious party, because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and very much. But one day there was a tragic incident. After the end of a White Sox game, I realized the remote was somehow at the other side of the room. Now I could wake up and walk through the room to get the remote control or even TV to start the channel. But then, why do not you get up and walk in the country to watch television in another state? "Nuts for that," I said. So I decided to stay tight on the sofa and take everything that Fate kept for me. What Fate had in the store was an episode of this show, an episode of which I remember very little, except that I once again made a very broad, general, sweeping judgment, based on objective or experimental evidence, without any support of my opinions with, and once again I was right! This show is a total pleasure! Belushi has all the comedic deliveries of a hairy bearded brick. Women are physically appealing, but Stepford too - is to get any real feeling from the spectator. There is absolutely no reason to stop running to the local TV station with a gasoline box and a flaming torch and send each copy of this mutt back to hell. <br /> <br /> Except for the wonderful comic lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's greatest comic character actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and it's gold. How good is it really? Well, besides being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make some warts look good. But Campbell does it with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Buffoonery to win every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would consist of a slightly vacant Thorne-Smith Curat that hits Belushi over his head with a skillet, while he alternately beats his chest and plays with straw on the floor of the cage . 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell has designated Comedic Bacon as it enhances the flavor of everything that is!
