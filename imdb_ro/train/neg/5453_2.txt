Ok we caught this movie in half, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is now in the Teachers and Book Group, although at least he has proved he can act if he wants to! (The part someone has a heart attack stands out for as a bad movie bastion does both in terms of action, scripting and general plausibility) It's pretty clear it seems to be a cash-in human traffic but in the same while it is not the best movie ever, it is at least original and has actors whose delivery does not resemble that of GCSE students seriously-still-hopeless trying to get a pass mark. Not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car accident!
