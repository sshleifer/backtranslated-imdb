The movie started pretty well. She had a man hit by a bright green meteorite, getting superpowers (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, dog speaking ability, superspeed, heat vision, and the ability to make plants grow big and fast) and combating crime. From there, it's all down. Meteor Man receives a costume from his mother, struggles with resident gangs and has many aborted encounters with gang leaders who serves to set you up for disappointing, prolonged and not so remarkably bad if you were not to look at a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to have hit each other while the audience still looks as the fighters continue to dance. Despite all these nonsense, the movie has good points. It clearly states that if you try to take a single tape, then they will come home and hurt you. It is said that gangs and communities must see their true enemies (the great bosses who use them for their own purposes to crush the honest in a ghetto existence). It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community destroying the predators that harm them. The only message he lacks is that voters should ensure that their elected (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and George H. W. Bush) are not scammers.
