I did not expect too much on "The Night Listener," and I've never heard of it until I've seen the videostore cover. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspension and tension. Sometimes it takes a bit, but it actually helps you wonder what will happen even more important: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is attracted to a kind of "cat and mouse", to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and the existence of a 14-year-old kid who is not a kid they seemed to have ever seen in person. The Night Listener is an exciting story that's great in building suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark by who's lying and what's real. However, it eventually disappoints and does not meet the potential it could have. It does not give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been useful and interesting.
