Sentinel is all about Hollywood's lack of soul and the lack of rooted imagination present in so many films these days. I can not think of a good thing about it, it's so generic, so the factory and so lazy gathered that there really is only an infomercial about how to make money from the unforgiving audience that does not deserve . /> A plot about a secret service agent who intends to assassinate President can be fun. If it is handled by a good director or a casting that is. Douglas is the one that's framed. Basinger is the first lady, with whom she has an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved story). Sutherland is the best friend who finds him guilty, because there would be no more films if he did not. Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and ... that's it. I think there are fewer requirements for women when entering the secret service. As usual, in a movie like this, the role of Prez itself is nothing more than an instrument, a symbol and is very poorly written. Clark Johnson, who gave us back as equally pathetic SWAT 2003, the mechanical direction has no signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their far-off performances. Eva Longoria, the most exposed woman of the 21st century, is basically just for this purpose to appeal to Disperate Housewives. Its role is 100% useless and does nothing to continue the plot or add to the character's development. It has only two lines to rub together. A really shameless marketing envelope. If you're a greedy punishment, then do not let me stop you. But it is the time and money that you will not receive.
