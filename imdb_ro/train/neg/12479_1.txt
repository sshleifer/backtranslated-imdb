DEATHSTALKER is perfect for fans of B-fantasy; this almost 80-minute film travesty has everything I can ask hecklers - nonexistent plot, terrible action (except at least one old age old), amusing writing and editing schlock and background style negotiation settings. There are no characters that come as pleasant or interesting (especially lead does not have any appealing about it) and the assembled actors do nothing to rise above the class F material. If this is not enough, then what remains with the lack of a compelling plot (which this film does not have) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major Turkish? I was also offended by the fact that the women in this film barely serve a purpose other than 1) be topless and / or sparkly dressed; 2) to have violated; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) All of the above. In addition, background music is hideous; a strange mess of electronic noises, the brick chocolate explosions and orchestral cacophony. Dazed by his ears and an eye sinking everything into one of amazing things to keep one interested, DEATHSTALKER is probably the best fit for people looking for something to laugh (and believe me, there's a lot here). Otherwise, I do not recommend that this 100th CONAN be at least.
