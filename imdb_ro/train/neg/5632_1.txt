I watched the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and then felt it was really a terrible movie. But you must have cut off quite a bit from the original movie or lost a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I also read some other comments on IMDb.com that mentioned vulgarity and something about a swab. I did not see that, just a bad, boring film with characters that could not be identified, and a sophisticated tribute plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botox to the gills, and an expression touches his face. And her name makes me think about super-dimensioning a drink at Taco Bell: "I'll have Cola Grande!" In fact, it was so fun that it was so bad, I have to play as if I were in my own Mystery 3000 Science Theater, noting that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's really like a stupid pile!
