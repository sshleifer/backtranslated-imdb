What a terrible movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but besides some interesting pieces, the movie is largely taken over by hysterical submarines crying, crying, sweating, and generally scared when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it with simplistic wings to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene in which Denzel Washington explains to a radio repaire how it should be that Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke) and you have a rough thriller that is not worthy of action. Let's just hope the US Navy is not in the hands of such a scenario! <br /> <br />
