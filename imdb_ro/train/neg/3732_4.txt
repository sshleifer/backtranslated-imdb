Maybe because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw him, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen her since I was in the seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect she's going to have on me now. Still, I will say he left an impression ... and most of my friends. She served her purpose at least until we were old enough and sufficiently familiar to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly appalled by what the newly converted post-rapist Christians had to endure when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to destroy the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention the details of the scenes, but I can still imagine them in the head ... and 19 years have passed.
