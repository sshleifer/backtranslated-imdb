Because there was nothing wrong with acting etc etc, writing for the episode is much farther for this ghost or ghostless series. It was a 42-minute loss to see the Martian hunter. You must know that in the middle of the sixth series, no matter what happens, it is not true what happens and does not really bring anything to the story of the series, except for the encounter of the Martian boatman and losing 30 minutes to do this is far from another case of bad writing in Smallville's soap. I really enjoy the show, but mainly because of the distribution and the 3 so good episodes every year, but which is ever on the written work that works or works on soap must be preserved. This was by far one of the worst. With the first 4 minutes you know that what is happening is false and whatever happens is a dream based on Clark's appearance, obviously provoked by a phantom ghost character, and when he wakes up he will also win bla bla bla that writers do not really have to create a bad character that will progress story line this week. He also added another bastard who died in the last episode that the Martian hunter had come and made him fly again or come back and tell Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to look more closely in this episode and name it a day.
