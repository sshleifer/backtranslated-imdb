Jimmy Dean could not have been stranger or absurd. Isteric if seen through the eyes of the Mystery 3000 Science Theater, which I calculate as 10. I want to say that the sight of this pig fed with corn fed around Malta should be enough to send you to the shed if you do so far of film. This ugly hysterical feud should be placed alongside Booty Call, Pumpkinhead, Swarm, and Smurfs Go To Bangladesh. A film of this kind proves that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc., return to the mortgage, or penetrate into stones to madness. The question is, "Who was so stupid to fund such a whale?" But then, good judgment prevailed and "Final Justice" was never, then we would not have the delightful voice of voices in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
