This movie is the worst movie, but it's very high for me. It's the way it should be a slasher movie. It takes place at a university where it seems to be just a handful of students. Teachers are stranger than a hammer bag. It is filled by a Catholic priest, a sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clicked that it is hard to believe that I could predict the lines in quotes. Slashing have some creativity and seem to spin around people stabbed in genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and the characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for fun. Take a cheap beer case and some friends, look at it and laugh.
