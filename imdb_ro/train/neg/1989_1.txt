I wanted to give this movie a zero, but that was not an option! This movie is shit !!! Women can not act. I should have known he'd suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house believed I did not change the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black females as guns in the Western days is ridiculous. it is not just a thing of race, it is also a genre. the combination of the two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some of the film are not bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was terrible. it was not credible like a movie. it could be "fun" for a certain group of people, but I'm not in that group. LOL. and using an extraordinary line of great great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
