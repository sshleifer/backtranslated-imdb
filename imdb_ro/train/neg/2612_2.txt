Only the reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was her nominations for the original design of Oscars songs and costumes. I have to admit I was less impressed with this movie. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close removes this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behavior. He likes all sorts of animals and blocks all his fur. From that moment on, we just wait for the crises to start. Pretty soon, she does and tries to make the best layer of fashion, of course for herself and for the Dalmatian fur. Besides Glen Close, I discovered everything that was really bad, but from the funny child's eye. This is quite fair because the target market is, I suppose, children under 12 years of age. Pretty fun for children and families, but it did not do much for me. * of *****
