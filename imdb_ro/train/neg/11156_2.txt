It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst performing and a story as weak as any other bastard in a high school theatrical film of the 1980s.

Someone is trying to make sure that Jason Voorhees's performance is the height of his film career ... Anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and eventually becomes a werewolf.
