Despite strange challenging thoughts in the script and the curiosity of the film, Fury of the Wolfman appears as a boring, uninteresting trip to lycanthropy, saved only by the statue's presence of the vicious Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including the Naschy hammer, are a complete retreat (though no one is helped by a often atrocious double). Although the script includes various varieties on werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau varieties to create a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characters so weak and the so ridiculous dialogue (at least in the English version) latently latent in turgid procedures are soon abandoned. Zabalza's direction seems offensive, even amateur. Staging is clumsy and inefficient. It is not helped by the too strong lighting of Villasenor. Even promising sets are photographed so unnaturally that a few attempts by the director to give the public a fear are signaled long ago Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude, although the score of the music over-emphatically shouts the first special effects, primitive, primitive, deserves special convictions.
