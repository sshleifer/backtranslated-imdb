The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create the mother's "invisibility". They looked as though they were shot on a cheap film, and it seems totally unreal, not even in a good way, where it's so funny you get to love the movie ... I did not get the love of this movie. Attempts to "steadicam" were even pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget, it's good. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, a BAD movie and a low budget and effects. That's a bad combination. In this case, such a convicted combo created the craptastic movie, "The invisible mother". If you have children and your children have no taste, they will probably stay awake in all of them.
