This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad is acting, bad scenario, all bad. Comparing it with the other two films of the same genre and about the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and more robust in both storytelling and direction, and Albert Pyun, who has guided both! the story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, probably because of an ecological disaster or a nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) lives in human blood and is the story ... Cyborgists have to make many people fulfill their "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. A girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by cyborgs creator was designated destined to save mankind. In this film the director tries a few scenes of battle with Hong Kong with the participants flying in height and floating away. The film mistakenly fails in this attempt. I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people will get a new "worst" movie ever. And for fans of the genre I recommend "Cyborg," because I think it's a very underrated movie with a pretty big factor of entertainment. And if you can not stay with Van Damme then check Nemesis. I rated this movie 1/10.
