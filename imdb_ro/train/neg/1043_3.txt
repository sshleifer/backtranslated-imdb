What a bad, stupid film! I can not believe all the hype that has been put on this pretentious, amateur excuse for a real movie! I left the theater before the end, amazed at how bad the direction and camera of that film was! And reading adorable paeans who claim that there is truth and reality in this film when everything is in reality is an attempt to pull wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals, being cheap and loud. <br /> <br /> At least this film has shown me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a total joke and that the presentation here is more of a bad movie label than anything else. Avoid at all costs. You will want to turn your time! I know I did.
