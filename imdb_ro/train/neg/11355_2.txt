"Nat" (by Trevor Gagnon), along with his brainwave friend "IQ" (voice of Philip Bolden) and "Scooter" (David Gore), always hungry, are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. What encourages his dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11, awaits his historic journey on the launch drum near the place where the three will come out. The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. We found it was over. The landscape was deep, because the remote things seemed to have been behind the scenes. I did not see the 3-D movie as it was on HBO. However, we could see that in reality there were no scenes that took advantage of 3D effects, except for a struggle between end-to-end characters. I was also not impressed with the characters' design. For me, they did not look like something like a fly, especially in coloring. Flies were an unusual blue that distracted my attention. The performance from the distribution was not bad, but it was not good either. Often I focused more on my computer than the story. Writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comical moments that would make the younger children laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, like jokes that they will get punchlines for adults to understand meaning. History was not followed in this movie. Actually, I think it was completely ignored, because the main focus was on the flies. I also hated when a famous astronaut appeared on the screen and explained to me that stories about the flies of the film were fiction and that they were not flies on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who had sacrificed their lives for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is certainly only for children. But, save it for a rainy day.
