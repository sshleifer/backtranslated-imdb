This movie has left me an impression forever. I looked him like a freshman in high school and I was alone at home that night. I think I have lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a great fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and bad. However, this film has had such an impact on me that I am now volunteer in the state prison of women who biblically study and church services and try to change the lives of women one by one. What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends has pursued this, and my family is not clueless until today when I'm talking about this movie because they did not see it.
