Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A good-looking werewolf film I admit started slowly, but gained an impulse along the way to get a pretty good finish, then the anchor turned into a cute little werewolf just to be shot in the room. Yeah, who made for a fun horror film to be sure ... forget it all because this movie has nothing to do with this movie. Of course they manage to make the anchor woman the same and her brother or something wants to find out why and why things went the way they did, but they come from the comfortably comfortably from the first movie in Transylvania or somewhere where he has to fight wicked magician wolves or something like that. I often wonder what Christopher Lee did in this world, but I read here trivia where he says he has never been in a movie before, but still read the script before taking a role. Perhaps you could have entered "A Wonderland American Werewolf" that would have been possible. It was established in London. Heck, the werewolves do not seem to think much about this movie, except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sexual scenario. In fact, the most memorable death of this movie for me was when a single gal began to speak loudly, and this elder's ears started bleeding.
