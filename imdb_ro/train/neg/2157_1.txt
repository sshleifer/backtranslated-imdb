Siskel & Ebert were great in this show, whether you agreed with them or not, because of the real conflict that generated their separate professional opinions. Roeper took this show down a note or two because he was not really a film critic and because he replaced the snide for opinion. Now, when Ben Lyons lights up, I feel like I look at "Teen News" - do you know the children's children's show, hosted by children? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious that they've only met a constant diet of mainstream movies all their lives. The idea that these amateurs with two ranks have something of interest or consequence to say about the movies is ridiculous. If I review a movie that is not formulated, they are completely lost. Show them something original and smart - they just find it "confused." Wait - I think I understand ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney is making movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were just hit-or-miss with high-budget studio productions - that surprise: these two guys LOVE the big schlock studio and just manage to tolerate a few Indians. Plus, everyone knows the age group that TV advertisers are targeting. The flagrant nepotism is the glaze on the cake. In what alternate universe these guys qualify as film critics?
