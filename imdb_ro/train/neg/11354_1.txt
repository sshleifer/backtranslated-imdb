I have also suffered hundreds of children's films in the past, I think this is one of the worst I've ever seen. 1) I am sorry that in this day and age I have to explain to my children that Russia is not "bad guys". Also, those Russian names such as "Poopchev" are inappropriate. 2) The grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's party contained a quasi-sex joke in which he assumed that men were drinking beer and women talking on the phone. The other two flyers also use the word "carp" twice. 3) The whole film revolves largely from the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s that I thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above us. <br /> <br /> <br /> In everything that is just cruel, badly animated, even worse writing and not worth wasting time to see.
