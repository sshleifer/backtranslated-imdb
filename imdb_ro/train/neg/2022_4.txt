Man, this has many good reviews in the review books. Frankly, it seemed to me too slow and untouchable from the beginning. I waited for a little steam, but that never happened. This movie is far overestimated. Shakespeare, with King James English, has never attracted me, anyway, to be just me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film because it shows that Ronald Colman plays Othello. Good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinema and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. In general, this is simply too boring, repeating too much in some of the scenes to look again. In addition, we all know that most actors are nuts, anyway, but kudos to Hollywood to demonstrate here in this story.
