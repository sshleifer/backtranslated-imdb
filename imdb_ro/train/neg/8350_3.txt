I just came back from "El Otro" playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I was very disappointed. The movie moves very slowly (do not misunderstand me, I enjoy the slow moving movies!) Slowly to the point of making you crazy. All you hear is that Julio Chavez breathes very much throughout the movie. This is a poorly accomplished film, but more importantly, it is a film without a lick of inspiration, I did not feel anything about the story or its characters. "El Otro" was made for the sake of making a movie ... forgotten. I advise you to submit this, if you want to watch Argentine movies, look for Sorin movies.
