Back in 1985 I caught this (I can not even call a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend, whose hormones are being controlled. I realized early that he was hopeless. A great screenplay (a bunch of old boys who hire some young people to show them how to score with women), bad action (with one exception), and pitiful jokes. Feminine nudity here kept my friend happy for a while, but even he was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - this was a high school boy! This was again before nudity was so easy to get to the Internet and others. We continued to pursue hope for something interesting or funny, but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the initial ad campaign where the studio admitted that this movie was stupid! (A poster had a fictional magazine that said: "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer at the forefront showed any talent and actually made a career in business. No budget and boring. Move on.
