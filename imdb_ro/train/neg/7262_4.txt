There are some really wonderful ideas in this violent film that, if executed clearly, could have lifted it from Western spaghetti in something special. Unfortunately, a town called HELL is one of the worst movies imaginable! The scenes begin and end suddenly, the characters leave for long periods, the performances (and accents) of the actors are quite inconsistent, etc. Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary (!) Who, after attending has deleted a village, remains to become a priest (!) ... ten years later, the village is headed by the "mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives for revenge on the man who murdered her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives in search of Shaw. Everyone shouts each other Lots and they all shoot each other. Fernando Rey is also in him (like a blind man). Performances are not bad, but they are highly unequal. Savalas has an accent sometimes the same as Landau (which is really grille here). Shaw and Rey show that they are incapable of being really embarrassed, and Stevens looks quite fox (unless there is a place between the sweaty bud).
