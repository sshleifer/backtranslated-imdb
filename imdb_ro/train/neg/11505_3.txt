This image reminds me of a 1957 photo by Keneth More, called The Admirable Crighton, "while on board, he was a servant, and on the island he became a master, and after he was rescued he returned to service. which shows Madonna can not act is this. I'm not sure if this was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton," but it certainly shows that Hollywood must give up ideas and it is sad to offer a platform for actors to improve their career profile and only that does not work in every corner and detail.> The script is free and the actor is mediocre, and the script should have been set in motion before it was taken. what many here have preserved Madoona for the entire actress, I think in films like "Their League" was pretty good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" showed a strange Madonne style that was not presented before or after Madonna's other movies are not as pleasant and I would love to see a series of Madonna animations with the character of "Who's That Girl" I love the music of these two movies, however, "Swept away" stays at the bottom of the heap here and will remain so. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a right bomb?
