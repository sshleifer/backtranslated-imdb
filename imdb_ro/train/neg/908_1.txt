After I bought the DVD in a trash can, due to the impressive number of features shown on the cover, I pushed it into the DVD player and everything looked good. Beautiful animation menus and a lot of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself, what came down. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The commentary that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from those who made the film. So you only think if you like to lose money!
