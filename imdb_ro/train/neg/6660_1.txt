Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is just confusing the mind. This show is not funny, it's not smart, it's not original, it's just a bunch of crap. Let me start with the characters. Characters are all one-dimensional morons, with powerful and exaggerated voices, which simply sound like nails on a blackboard. The voice might have been better. Then is the animation. My God, my eyes hurt just by looking at her. Everything is too flat, too sharp, too bright and too covered candy. Then is humor or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! I'm just taking these type B jokes that are not that funny first and then repeating them to death. It also throws away a useless mirror that hurts me. And finally, the last and the smallest, the music. It's just annoying. Apparently it was composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotion. I want to be a score lower than 1, I really do. This show must be seriously canceled. It's a show I'm trying to avoid as a plague. Whenever I hear the theme song, I immediately turn off the TV. If you have never watched this show, then do not do that. Watch quality programs like The Simpsons or Futurama.
