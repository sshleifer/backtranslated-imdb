I have the impression that the producers of this clutter would do the most painful, ridiculous western ever made. "THE BABY" is the best word I can think of describing. On the plus side you have a beautiful color photo and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy is heading to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the crypt), who acted quite well in an annoying role, written so atrociously that no actor could give a good performance. Production values ​​were pretty good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and scenario. Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked so little like a Western figure, with his British accent, and a tiny, immeasurable handkerchief tied around his neck. It was tiring as the people in town and his son were always harassed and insulting Granger, and he never spoke or answered back. I know we should suspend the mistrust and appreciate the Westerners as symbolic morality, but this broke the spell with brilliant scenes of unrealistic and predictable, the worst being at the end of the year when Granger, miraculously, quickly and with a single hand, dynamizes around a canyon pass through the bad guys' cattle, and then Granger will be planned in the perfect place so he can shoot dynamite from a very long distance to create slides to bury and scare bovines and boys bad, the two bad guys. The worst thing is that of the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the movie seemed credible: I could not believe what the whole conflict was all about. The wicked ruled the flock on the market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the road; I do not see why something could not have been solved. Do you need a land ownership dispute for that? Do not bother to see.
