Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode of Twilight Zone trying to get out. While the Cube was stretched, well done, claustrofob and mindful, I'm afraid that Cypher is a bloody remix of many well-worn themes that do not add too much, especially if you've seen almost anything something else halfway down the decent SF movie before. Cypher manages to pull all the way through his relatively short time of 95 minutes until the end of the incompetent. None of the characters are triggering each other, and for a movie made in 2002 technology is really cheese. It's difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie to the Cube director. It's not a bad movie, but the safest is not a good one. When you watched how the grass grows and dries dry and gets bored with your insects, then with all the means it follows this movie, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.
