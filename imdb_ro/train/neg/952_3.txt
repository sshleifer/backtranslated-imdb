Happy Go Lovely is a waste of the time and talent of everyone, including the audience. The ease of the wrong identity of wrong identity and false scandals is forgiving. Very few people have watched these films for their plots. But they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots - not here. They usually had an interesting choreography and amazing dances and appealing songs. Go Happy is not happy. And Vera-Ellen, as a female daughter, played the whole movie as a second banana, staring desperately for a star to play - and instead she was called to carry the film and could not do it. The Scottish community was wasted. Typically, Scandinavian abuse is usually ubiquitous. The photo was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing the landscape, since no one else has fulfilled his role as producer often routed by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is fine and no one has made David Niven as David Niven. At the end of the day, if you adore Niven as I do, it's enough to lose 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
