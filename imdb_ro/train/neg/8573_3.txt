I do not really like Sean Penn's direction, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it is colored with a sort of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work, its last work even more than earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole crowd seems to produce a fundamental banal product, apparently in some loyalty to honesty but largely ending in pro-glorified and moralistic struggles, almost if the Hallmark books had developed a line of greetings of Hell's Angels and would make a lot of time for the Deliverance days, which is a great movie. Viggo Mortensen's act is much, much more credible here than the ridiculous thing promised by the East that he did with Cronenberg, and that's it. The film is deadly and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. However, Kudos for Charles Bronson, who proves that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis's character. An evil of 3 out of 10 for this Indian Runner Carp.
