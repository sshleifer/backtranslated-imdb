Left Behind is a kind of film that Christians (and most other naive people) need to help them feel that what they "FIND" and "BELIEVE" (not "KNOWN") is right. But at the same time, I feel bad about the little ones because it's not a good movie. It does not help any messages. I'm working at a video store, and I know the only reason people came to see this movie because they were religious and thought they were. CINEMA on this earth, which MINE THINKS knows what will happen in the future is wrong, if I do not think I know I do not know. I had enough (but only after I had too much) of people who were swimming with my nose thinking that a movie with a semi-talented television actor means something above me. /> Please, if you love, you will stay away. I refuse to get into the details about this movie (not because AI did not see it (because I did it) It was too shocking for my atheist to handle it (because it was not) I have nothing to say about That's why I'm doing this. The reason (which is a word that no one helped to understand this movie) is that I want this movie from the head, I want it to be made of my head, I want to look at it all with open my head, I want the message that Kirk put at the end of the movie in my head. In my head BEFORE watching the movies there, any direct connection with this movie floating in my head GET OUT! My peaceful wrath is over. I'm sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what might happen in the future (but not) when it could have given that Seven Dollars Plus to any charity of people, animals or rainy woods that they would not be able to "believe" in the fact that is real, might actually be what it is. LEFT LEFT LEFT (from ****)
