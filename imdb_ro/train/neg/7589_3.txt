What do you expect when there is no start-up scenario and nothing with which the director can work. Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, have nothing to say or something to react to. Even the earthquake was rather poor. And I do not know how closely the film follows the novel, but two of them have come from nowhere just to show that Arturo has a warm and warm heart, but some stereotypes are nothing. And she even buries Camilla out in the desert instead of bringing her back to LA for a nice Catholic funeral where she could have brought her at least the flowers once. Pathetic. And the L.A. was graphically created ridiculously. Any good? The window in his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It has been since they were those who lived the body or the night of the dead, whatever it was.
