This film was the longest film and the record breaking video surely had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002) I think nobody had the courage to do anything like that The movie as the title suggests is based on the war in Kargil but the problem is that there are too many characters and the romantic subtleties and songs of many characters are boring Even there are too many kinematic freedoms like killing people with knives, does the soldier do that? Direction of JP Dutta pales the front of the border Music is OK Among the huge distribution Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also is his first film with kareena, Abhishek is sympathetic Manoj Bajpai has Sanju moments is wasted , Suneil is OK Akshaye Khanna is good rest part are acceptable Rani is good, Esha is good rest are acceptable
