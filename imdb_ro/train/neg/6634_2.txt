The first look on the cover of this image looks like a rock n roll. But do not let cover to fool you or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The story is just horrible, so do the acting. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a love story so terrible that you see it through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why they give 2 out of 10. Had it not been for music, it would have been 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980) and the girl playing the group is not well shown! This movie was a great disappointment to me because it makes many good promises.
