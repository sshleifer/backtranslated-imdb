This series was the CBS network response to Big Valley success. It was a West minute, like the ABC program. While there was an answer, he did not have to do this in season 2. The problem has truly become a reality lost in this show. For example - in an episode, Johnny takes his eyes out of a stick. Amazingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had healed completely. At the same time, the stories about this were not where almost as strong as the Great Valley. This is a show I would not like DVDs for, and I sincerely hope they are never released. Think CBS has left the batches, they've managed to use many familiar settings. This was the last Western series produced by CBS, because Westerners were not very popular in the 1970s.
