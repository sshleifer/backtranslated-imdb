I do not think it's possible that a comedy horror movie fails so steeply on both fronts ... very horrible. The fact that it is not taken seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, first because the actors are so woody that you really swear they have read cue cards. After all, although ..... the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ....
