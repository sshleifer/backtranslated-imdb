I saw an early viewing of this movie in New York and I, along with my friends and the general public, were very disappointed. The movie was not that bad that it was good; he was as lifeless as a victim of a snake bite. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired by the majority, and the effects of the serpent were blades. She remembered one of those SciFi movies, except that this movie was not funny or even camouflaged. Everything seemed tired, full, and very expressive. I am shocked to say that I think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a play and plays with it, but the movie fails to board is a scenario that has suspense. It's the worst sort of blade movie: it's joyless.
