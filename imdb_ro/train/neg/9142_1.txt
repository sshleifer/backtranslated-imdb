I just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see me for me. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will not be able to understand how horrible this movie is, though it must be one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen! I did not bother to post a comment here before, but this piece of nonsense guarantees it. <br /> <br /> First, the entire plot is ridiculous and meaningless. The brother of the main character (either Ben or Arthur, I forgot who he is and who, frankly, is never clear) wants to stop a kind of homosexual marriage by killing everyone before his eyes - because homosexuality is discouraging to Christians but apparently it is not mass murder. There are other nonsense thrown around an ex-wife of the gay couple, trying to force him to remarry the gun. This leads to nothing but gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the entire movie - "I have no sense, you do not make sense! That makes sense!" Brilliant. Then act, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My personal privilege is the apparently painted civil rights lawyer, who clearly reads the lines on her but still manages to get involved. Quite telling. The young homosexual can not be less convincing. He is the vaguely attractive and gormless type of guy, and his friend looks like that little cartoon guy from bisto advertising. Only fatter. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The film was also filmed by someone unable to hold a room even from a distance, and the number of mistakes along it is amazing. The whole thing starts with the main fat type in the bed with a pair of boots. Yes, anyway, we all know how terrible this is, so I would like to highlight some of the most invaluable comedy moments the "movie" offers. <br /> <br /> - When the type of fat throws the church into the fire and then prays like a six-year-old girl across the parking lot to get rid of it. Lovers. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! No idea of ​​what relationship she has with the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they do not, but she appears in a few scenes. Loving. <br /> <br /> - The lawyer with stones. I already said it, but it's so funny it deserves another mention. - The dinner of the bad brothers of biscuits that he puts for his guests. - Brother of evil anti-gay potion. <br /> <br /> - The bad brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end I will not give, because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you, however, make sure you do not eat on time !!!! The tide of the main character / producer / producer of butter becomes empty. It is wrong. Practically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably evil but unintentionally the most comic thing you will see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a movie, the director's journey even manages to make opening credits in a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
