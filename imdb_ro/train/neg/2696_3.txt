I know that John Singleton is a perfect guy, because he made Boyz N The Hood as he wrote and directed it? It's like the bad guy "to go to school for the first time," teen teaspoon, a dash of dull stereotypes, and clich√© with some free-throwing threats to make a commercial proposition, I think. Who would have guessed that the rape victim would throw the seafood sausages? The only angry loner would be stuck by a group of neo-Nazis (and would have sat down with a black and a Jew - just for laughing!) Even the reactionary story of Laurence Fishburne Professor just irritated me and I love the guy, all those involved in this movie just lost the plot. Except for Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.
