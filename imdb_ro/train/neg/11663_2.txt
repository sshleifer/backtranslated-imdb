WHITE STOPS Wait, why would not she dress like Black Chicks, oh yes, it would not look different. Can someone give me a Wayans movie where they did not dress like ladies? Do not Be A Menace does not matter, Jack White's ghost and Michael Costanza wrote that (the other members of Norton Trio acted as directors). In White Chicks, there is never any joke. Just Wayans act as girls for 2 hours. There are no configurations, there is no laughter and no laughter. There's a lot of "I think I'll play some time Crisis 3." At least for me it was (5 times to be exact). Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only gifted), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies. His only wounded on the O-Zone. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * from ****
