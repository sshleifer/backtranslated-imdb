Let me start by saying I'm going to try not to put too many spoilers in that. Normally I like Robin Williams' movies, but this jewel was not one of them. It was paid as a suspense thriller. The night listener was nothing but. To be blunt there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, 2 came out for a good reason. The film was badly written and directed in my opinion. The actress was fine, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dying child. However * enter spooky here * No one can check the existence of children. So Williams is going to Wisconsin to try to find the author, yet all he gets is a headache and an apology from the boys' caretaker. That's it, that's all. Wait about an hour and a half and the movie ends. She had so much excitement and chills as a visit to a dentist's office. The gay subtones, or subtleties, had nothing to do with the story, and the film had a little profanity, but it seemed to have thrown there for absolutely no reason, and it made no sense. In conclusion, I really can not write a decent review on this movie, because it was nothing for him, it was just as exciting as having seen the dry paint. I gave him a 2 because the actor for what he deserved was ok and was not directed by Uwe Boll.
