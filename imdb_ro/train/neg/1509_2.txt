I really have problems rating this movie. It is brilliantly directed, obviously there is a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (although the screen personality might use them a little more and more), editing and cinema are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of the really sick movies, where you can not help wondering if the director likes the specific scenes and, yes, you can not help thinking how many copies will inspire such a movie. /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's 9, but I have to wonder who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....
