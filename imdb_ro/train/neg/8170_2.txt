A friend and I went through a phase a few years ago to select horror movies in the video store for evening entertainment. For some reason, I've come to buy this (probably v. V. Cheap). The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of time and its genre. There are some very funny scenes. These include a scene where a man is attacked and defends with a number of unlikely objects, made me laugh at the time (it does not look quite funny in retrospect, but you go there). <br /> <br /> Besides, it's total stupidity, think about it. But it's probably worth a watch if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yeah, I saw that too.
