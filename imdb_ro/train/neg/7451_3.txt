Sorry, it's not good. It starts exciting, but loses its way in the film for a few minutes. It does not help very much that none of the normal actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) offer very good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be because I saw a dubious version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was especially wood and annoying, and Danny Glover is not really a credible villain. Moreover, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story (except saving the life of a main character at one point, but that scene is just as necessary as a windscreen wiper on a submarine ;-) <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is indeed the confused and clich√© story: Detective (of course!) He has to solve a personal problem with the villain and is (of course!) Suspended from his official duties by courtesy his personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * He wants * to be watched and plays a cat and mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies rely on a similar plot - most of them better, However. <br /> <br /> The parcel has rough holes and many completely useless and useless scenes that do not contribute or do not work well with the story at all (for example, the truck stop scene or the car's edge at the edge of the cliff, etc.) In the end, the end tries to be original and interesting, but fails completely in these respects. I've seen a lot more finalizations with some sort of final battle-on-train-in-fornor-winter landscape ... Finally, there is the assumed reunion of the parent and child ... hokey, at least .
