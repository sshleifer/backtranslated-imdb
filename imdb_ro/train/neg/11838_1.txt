If your entertainment idea views graphic images of people driven by cars (see a woman passing under the front wheel, being twisted as the car passes over it before it goes under the rear wheel - and a shows it twice if you missed it first), then this is the documentary for you. Admitting that I did not watch any very disturbing voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Perhaps the rest is even better. I wonder how long it will take for television networks to start showing slush movies. Maybe game shows based on self-mutilation might be nice. I already know there are troubled people in the world, and horrible things happen. I do not have to see the evidence on the TV that acts as entertainment.
