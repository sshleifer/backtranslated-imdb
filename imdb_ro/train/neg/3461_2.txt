Filming films are often seen as derivatives, repetitive and frankly non-original. I happened to be a horror film fan, but this movie was just so poor, the words failed. The scenario is severely lacking, the intrigue is ridiculous, acting amazingly bad. Just a stinker around me, I lost my time in my life. This had all the entertainment value of a fifteen sequel to a movie that was terrible, first of all. <br /> <br /> Who embraced this misery? I just liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was beautiful. The second was the Austrailian affinity with humorous profanity. Save yourself and avoid this terrible mess.
