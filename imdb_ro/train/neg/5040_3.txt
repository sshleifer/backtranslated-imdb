I read the comments about it being the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you've seen have had no dialogue, long drawn and silent, and hack editing, then you're on the scene. Hard. Try minors and amateurs. Exquisite shine and haunting memories? Hard. Try to get bored and let go. It was terrible. I could not wait to finish. Especially when the best lines in the movie are "How are you? I'm fine, are you sure?" Wow! What depth of character. I think uncontrolled smoking should talk to them. As a great fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was completely disappointed in this regard. Even Zhang is sentimental digging "The Road Home" was better than that.
