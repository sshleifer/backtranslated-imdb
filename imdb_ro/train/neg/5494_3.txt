<br /> <br /> A cheap and ugly look, this film did not even seem to entertain the kids in public except for a funny joke. Christopher Lloyd is far beyond his first and, in fact, quite tiring in this role, although excuse for the jokes of writers does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is an amateur full of embarrassment in a supposedly comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable to compare it with the often-brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
