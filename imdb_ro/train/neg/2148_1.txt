Possible spoilers, maybe. I have to say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First, the movie was made during the height of Disney War. It was created at the same time as "Little Mermaid II", "Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which are disadvantages for their classical classic film. (Disney has also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I'm going to give up that topic because their original films have never been classical first.) Let me go I say that I am a passionate supporter of good Disney movies and absolutely love Disney "Cinderella". Continuing Cinderella, however, was a waste of time, the character of Cinderella being so different from the original girl Cinderella was kind and full of love. The new Cinderella had extraordinary characters, with the expressions of the current era: "I will make this banquet in my own way!" you as the new Cinderella (as I called it with affection) says: "Ewww!" This is anti-Cinderella. I'm trying to find the best of people, but in sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepists, is good! Why? They've done everything like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just members of the terrible family for Anasta. My Question to the World: Did Disney people watch the original "Cinderella" when they did this? Well, it certainly does not look like this. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. They are all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no sense of redemption for Anastasia in this film. In the first, Anastasia was bad. In the second, she is good. One can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this film, among other films, distorts Walt Disney's name. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner has disappeared, things will begin to form around the Mouse House.
