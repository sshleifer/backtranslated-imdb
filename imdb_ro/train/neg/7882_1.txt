After I stopped at the movie store to find something to watch, I got over it. It was appealing from the abstract, at least, so I tried it. And here is kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, he spoke too fast. Somewhere there, the movie had a disgusting transformation into Christian Christian fundamental washing, right. I'm not sure what's going on, but I think the writer found God there somewhere, finished writing this script and did not have time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting to meet his friends in the Westboro Church and with his hood is not clean. Can they give warnings about that? I refuse to support this religious idiom. Just like video games have rating systems, the movies need a kind of symbol: maybe a small cross in the lower corner to show us that a movie will have a bad deal for the worst. feelings of everything that went with this story and have the Bible open in your lap as you follow this and plan how you turn your neighbors, do not waste your time. These are some of the worst junk that has come out in a very long time, and radical religious walnuts no longer need funding.
