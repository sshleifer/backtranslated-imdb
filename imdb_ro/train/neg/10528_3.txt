I chose this because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a metasonix modular synthesized customer (made by someone my dear). The art jacket says "the 2003 version". I give him a point for a strong female, a point for the stingy dialogue and a final point for the megastre eyes of meg foster, of which there is a lot of it was fun to see David MacCullum swim occasionally (the pool has a viewing window of plexiglass!), while the love of her ladies was followed by a psychopath in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were marginal impressive - the rich houses of the people of LA and Mendanassos (where?), where the castle was. I woke up wondering how they managed to keep clean with all the blown dust. The wind was not strong enough to be credible to me. I thought the leather on the furniture must be unpleasant ... and I realized that the film must be pretty boring if she asks me these things when it's supposed to be the alleged plot. I found things like why he lit a fire, blew the match and threw the match into the fire! A terrible thing like that. It was at best. Good. Robert Morely has to have some fun with his scary character and a nice vacation.
