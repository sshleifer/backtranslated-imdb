I have recently watched this film at the GÃ¶teborg Film Festival for 30 years and, to be honest, it was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Do not get me wrong, fun and funny movies (like "Manos' hands of fate") and then there are terrible movies. (This is in this category). Cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. I felt deliberately that the cameraman kept everything out of the fire (except for a free shot of nipples), enlightenment was something between "a guy running around with a light bulb" and "non-existent." The actors were just as bad as the soap players, but not as bad as the porn actors, and they felt that each line came as a total surprise to them. The only ransoming feature was the look of the masked murderer, a classic look of Jason Vorhees of the "Friday 13th". The plot was extremely poor, and the end was even worse. I would recommend this film to anyone who would need an example of how it should not be a horror movie or maybe an insomnia needs sleep.
