I would have given a movie from zero to ten, but I will give it two. Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a smooch with Kamal. I love Rani very much and I have a respect for being a great actress. That's why I did not enjoy it in this movie kissing Kamal, but that's not a big deal. However, quite a few scenes in the bedroom that made this movie visible, allow you to talk about this movie. It's good or bad, I think it's a complete garbage film that made me marry. I'm a fantastic critic, you can see my other reviews of over 250 people by clicking on my name, I have a great taste. The movie is not fun is one thing and if this is supposed to be hard to hit the cinema, why there is no moral in this movie. His biased film is not a true story and moves. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, Man can not kiss properly properly anyway.
