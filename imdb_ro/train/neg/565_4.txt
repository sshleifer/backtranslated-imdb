The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver". Instead of composers writing during the stylistic period of the game, they wrote only Broadway songs, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically erased. Also, the brutal and reckless actions of dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties that penetrate the score. It's an uncomfortable mixture that leaves a really sour sour snack. Casting Oliver's boyfriend does not help in the matter: stamp and precious, it's a little less solid than here. Fagin adequately fulfills his traditional routine, although the songs he has to sing have no basis on a regular basis. "As long as I need," he has a strident, throaty and tense teaching. The two big production numbers, "Who's to buy" and "Realize", seem to be over-produced, quite different from the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to get out, but another to go over the overhead line. <br /> <br /> Hope, despair and depravity of the majority of the novel does not seem to be spreading to such ditties and choreographers. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess that I have problems with Mr Dickens's consciousness in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of unfulfilled personal life, full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all of the combined talent of this production, either in the room or behind the camera, can overcome the nonconstructive nature of the base material. All of this results in an inconvenient experience for me. <br /> <br />
