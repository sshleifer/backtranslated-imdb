This obvious pilot for a series of unproduced television shows Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as amnesia, with some pretty incredible powers to be implemented when a stray demon of people is left free in the world. CGI is a hair for a television station, and Appleby is OK as amnesia, but hard to swallow like a super heroine. Familiar TV facing Richard Burgi is along for strolling as Appleby mentor, but he can do nothing to lift this upright level above the mediocre. We see too much of the cartoon flying demon right from the start, a bad sign. Also, scenes where Burgi trains Appleby for battle are actually ridiculous. I'm a bad copy of similar scenes from several movies, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
