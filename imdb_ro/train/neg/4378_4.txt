Considering the title and art of extraordinary boxing, I was ready for anything. Perhaps my expectations were forced only a little to the height, because I was a bit dry. A film crew working on a sexual film end up in a strange house when it's lost in the fog and decides that the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where was not this setting used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to display all the goods (the inguinal photos have been illegal in Japan for a long time, which is shown to be naked), the film is as hard as it can show the spectator how hard it can be unnatural sex. In the midst of all the perversions, a monster of mud (of which I can not understand it) appears and starts killing men and raping women ... then killing them They. Some of the sights are a bit more, especially a woman who has intestines extracted through the vagina or another woman who spits a piece of ... stuff, but otherwise the gore is quite standard. > Finally, the movie is pulled down by your own drawings; is too over-sexed to be a terrible and too scary picture of working like a sexual blow. Mediums can work, but there must be a balance. 4/10
