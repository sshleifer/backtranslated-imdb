Corpse Grinders 2's film, Ted V. Mikels's film, is 103 minutes of cinematic agitation. Complot is pretty much a mixture of absurd business relationships among people who eat cats in cat food, while cat aliens who lose a war with strangers dogs seeking to get some of their cat food. Watching this movie, I began to look for any kind of distraction, anything to calm me that I was doing but to lose my mind from the outside. More scenes take too long, that the characters take forever simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use too much waste, fearing that they will confuse the audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "vanguard" or just "bad". Tryin 'how I could, I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessary distribution except for the possible exceptions of the elders who are the caretakers of the factory. Most of the cast are a bunch of talented amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics to "Amazing Grace" before they sing in the room. Although it may blame it should go to the poor quality of the sound because I actually heard about 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. This is probably the worst movie ever to be shot. I listened to fragments of the comment, and Mr. Mikels came like a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing to do this kind of garbage? I would like to hear the explanations of the elders who were supposed to be without shirts on a metal carrier waiting to be founded. The movies I've hated for a long time seem much better. I wish Excalibur's intermittent music and the consistent light of the Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, anything. You do not see this movie.
