I watched this movie simply for decoration. He was filmed in an old hotel that a friend holds shares of. The story was predictable, the act was mediocre at best, frightening was all mistakes, not true scams. I do not remember too much of the plot and I think because it was not so, a large number of people remember. They have not even used the hotel to have the greatest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At reflux, you can go about 1/4 mile in the bay, which is actually a wonderful sight first thing morning or late night, when the wind screaming through cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand, so you can fast forward through the action (and I use this free term) scenes and pause to the beauty of the surroundings!
