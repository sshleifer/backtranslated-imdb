This was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this movie was mainly to show the newcomers who did pretty good for the beginners, but, above all, the movie was not credible. > With all gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. Even the coin was a mistake on Sean was bad. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the currency is the bug was not realistic. It seems that this movie has been studded fast. Poor pregnancy. Get a better writer. The countdown to the end was not in sync with anything. It took more time to fight. And a coincidence that every time Billy was going to make Sean, he had no bullets anymore. Once, I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was crazy. It was so bad when Sean hit him. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
