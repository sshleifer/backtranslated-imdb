do not watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look for this documentary and you will see the facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ Documentary series Death of Yugoslavia five episodes) is a thorough analysis of the massive blood mass research the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and took place almost the first half of the 1990s. It includes a huge wealth of news and interviews with both Yugoslav and other parties involved. The only "real improvement" that could be made for this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of further developments in the Balkans from the program. This was indeed done in the late 1990s for a repeat showing on BBC television, but adding more recent events would help complete this admirable and detailed work. Can another whole episode be justified? The very succinct title of this documentary became even more appropriate by the possible abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro, now called - a very sharp and formal admission of what happened years ago. /> <br /> No fiction as in "Yugoslavia: Avoiding War (1999)"
