Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tango and, yes, tap-dance her way through this regular thriller, which has a distinctly-made '30s atmosphere. Two ladies, reunited when their sons commit a crime, try to start their lives, leading a dance dance school in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is affected by neurosis. Can you imagine this 10 years earlier, with Robert Aldrich guiding Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would not have allowed Joan so long to gather his stuff and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the other roll, dancing her heart. This is a purely false piece of macabre, written by Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​"good shock" is to stage the mass killing of a group of rabbits!). It's not an odd ounce of fun in the whole heat pack. * 1/2 from ****
