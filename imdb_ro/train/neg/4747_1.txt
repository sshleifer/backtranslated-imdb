I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only good thing about China's film history was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the battle scenes were very brick and false. Many actors and actresses were not very good. Some of the jokes that were supposed to be "funny" were really bad. I think this movie should get the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really received more information about Chinese history if it wants to create an extravagant film. Mulan was pretty precise. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
