So far, you should know about this movie, Jessica Simpson's "Bomb", which went pretty much to the movie (limited, anemic). Practically, Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her friend, surprise him, just find him in bed with another woman. She is stuck, but she has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like to see more often in the movie), who lets her stay. Katie gets to find a job through two convinced collaborators (Penelope Ann Miller and Andy Dick always funny) who just use Katie to remove Larry Miller from the company. This is strictly a b movie, is not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is fairly beautiful and never really annoying. The film can be traced by the fact that it is not an abomination, but its bow to throw. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me giggle) and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (he does not read too much about this). So, not horrible, but easy to skip. Your sure bet is to watch it on TV if it ever happens. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
