This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up in Vietnam as I did, then you've seen and heard all the filming and arguments here a hundred times before. But what really makes this boring movie really is the narrative of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is shot with Sherwood speaking directly in the room about his opinion of this conflicting moment in our nation's history. If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you have won "find something new here." There is no new evidence to convict John Kerry or new evidence about another documentary about Vietnam. Those interested in this subject should see the great movie of George Butler Going Upriver! The storm of honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet work on John Kerry, but fails to accomplish that goal.
