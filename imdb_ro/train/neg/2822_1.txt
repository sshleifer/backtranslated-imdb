OMG this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would have been in this movie? Did he need the money that was wrong with him? I like AJ and I have seen almost everything she ever was, so I looked at it 2 tick another. It was bad! not even bad evil, bad bad. It had 1 or 2 funny moments, but everything was bad in a waste of 101 minutes. I can not even say that AJ looked good in her because she did not succeed. Plot is predictable if you do not expect to re-tell about Romeo and Juliet, then you do not. Everything disappointing. Maybe if your 12 could be a good movie otherwise I really do not recommend it.
