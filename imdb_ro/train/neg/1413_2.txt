I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an appealing, appealing and talented actress. I'm sure it would have been a good movie if something had happened. Nothing is happening. It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, we scanned the remaining 20 minutes. Excruciating. Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked from time to time - looking for a part he could play as a checkout clerk in a supermarket. Visit the supermarket where they work. Nothing is happening. She decides to take her home trip and they go to an Arby, a Target, a car wash. Nothing is happening. They were talking about their lives. Nothing is happening. Ever. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But they also do not get Bill Murray's "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers." If you like these movies, you may like this. A lot of people find movies like this capricious, charming or - for reasons that escape me - find the fascinating dialogue. A common device in movies of this type is to have a long silence / silence after an actor delivers a line that should make sense. We know it makes sense because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. I'm sorry, I have to be a philistine. I do not understand. For me, these types of movies are not funny, charming or challenging to think. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. Do not laugh. No suspense. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, none of the things I'm doing to the movies. I can bore you for free. I see strange / strange characters in real life. I'm going to Target, fast food restaurants and washing machines. These elements do not make a movie, even if stars do these things. I'm going to be fun. If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and you feel that you hear it is nothing, have fun. If you want to sneak over Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise you. A total snoozefest.
