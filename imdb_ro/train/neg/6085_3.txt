In this paranoia boiler, our reporter hero is battling with impeded authorities, with duplicate colleagues, renegade UFO dungeons, and silent aliens. (Although able to control the mind and put objects from outside, it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script gathers from event to event, leaving puzzlers aplenty. Why did strangers blind the dog? Why did the soldiers fry with the radiation just patrolling an empty landing place? And what space dudes worth the month cheese abduct the first ugly photographer instead of his model? Minds who want to know! Writer-director Mario Gariazzo has apparently researched his subject by hiding a lot of UFO tabloids as he took on a dual feature of Sunn Classics. (The screen closes on the fact that it is based on real events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by the end, but they should turn to conspiracy coils.
