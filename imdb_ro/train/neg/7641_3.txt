This is one of those movies that tries to be moody and tense, and instead ends up triggering all over itself. After seeing her at a queer film festival, I was intrigued by the "young college who had to be deceived" write-up, however, everywhere she was quite disappointed. It's hard to criticize a "true story," because there's not much to do about the plot - but we've discovered this disjointed, melodramatic and completely depressing. It is dark and almost sinister, painting a gentle mildness of the seventies, with impressive music and some wonderful flying. It just does not work - some scenes in which they were so stunning that instead of amazement, my audience was suppressing snickers and rolling eyes. The story has an interesting concern, but this only pours down into a dark, miserable spiral.
