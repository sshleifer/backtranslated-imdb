I'm sure people on the Texas / Louisiana border must have had a good laugh or two when Paramount's B picture unit caused him during the war public. Quite simply, the area along the Sabine River, where the film opens, is the cotton land just like the rest of the South Deep or at least the South Deep was post civil war. There are no big cattle empires there, they are far farther west of Texas, farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could go to set up his empire. The film starts with their two partners in a riverboat, and when Leo Carrillo attempts a theft of their services without paying them to take off their cattle, they keep the cattle. And this is the beginning of the great Ponderosa as a ranch on which I start. On the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford, and doubts with much smaller neighbors. Besides, we Westerners who like Westerners do not usually bother us with geographic rifles, and it's still a good West of the production mill of Harry Sherman, who produced all those Western Hopalong Cassidy for Paramount. The climax is an ignition, and I mean literally the fighting weapon that should have been used on a production A. But I would not have other Western fans to look at it.
