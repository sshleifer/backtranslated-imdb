How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie, I thought Manos: The hands of fate was the worst piece of nonsense I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you could fall asleep, saving your eyes the pain you will suffer. The biggest tragedy of this film is that the old man who holds Hobgoblins "closed" makes it on the final stage. The time spent watching this movie was an absolute loss of my life.
