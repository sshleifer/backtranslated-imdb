God, I have not been watching such a horrible film for a long time. Maybe not from "The New Guy" or from different movies Freddie Prinze Jr. Yes, it's terribly terrible. Sorvino's bridegroom, who has no part, must be inspired by Freddie. Stage shooting was awkward (as a piece, rather, and that sense of confession DOES NOT work well on the film). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible and her sex did not exist here, so it was painful to see her seduce other characters and "fall" for it. And what about the eye-catching photographs of a living audience in the lawn chairs? No Sens! You had to disable the dvd player, it would have been a self-inflicted pain to complete this movie.
