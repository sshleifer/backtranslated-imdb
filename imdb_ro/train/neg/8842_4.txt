It is somewhat to say that most of the reviews for the IMDb movie come from people who have just reviewed a movie in their entire IMDb career and yes, you guessed it was "Parasomnia". Often I have suspected that there are good suspicions about IMDb for what turns out to be a quality movie, but not as a good marketing, but it seems quite transparent in this case. That does not mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops too little to be good or great movie had the potential to be. On the plus side, he has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick, who does a brilliant work designing menacing and evil, I could easily see him having what is necessary to play a truly memorable baddie on Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful pictures in the dream sequences, in fact, if the movie would have decided to explore that more land it could have been a little better. The real concept of abuse of hypnosis abuse is also great. Although I understand that the suspension of unbelief is necessary to be submerged in any good story, it is the sign of a good story that manages to let you do that. If you get angry at what you find illogically or simply stupid, then the story loses you, and that's what kept me with this movie. Other commentators have mentioned this here and I do not want to enter the spoiler's territory, but I will say that the configuration at the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not mentioning too much the different mental age of a character who should have only had a few years of life. On the whole, there is the germ of a great idea here in hypnotism abusively abused, but unfortunately this film fails to achieve it in something special.
