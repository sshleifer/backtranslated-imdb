Lee hosted 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about movie werewolves. He said something in the sense that his only lycanthropic brush was The Howling II, then he limped: "The less they said about it, the better." Indeed, he was right, because this movie may be the worst in his entire catalog of screen shots. Joe Dante's first "Howling" was a werewolf film, with incredible special effects and his sense of style and object. It was a movie to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers believed that, for a strange reason, more campaign resumances were needed than they were for the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles from the first on each face. There is absolutely nothing scary about this. It looks cheap and is black pitch through most major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that's worth mentioning (well, I'm gonna give Ferdy Mayne too). Lee seems embarrassed, saying the dialogue is ingenious and makes ridiculous things (check that he ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this is, which is younger than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not worth examining here, and you can bet that there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel playing in much of the movie at the beginning and end this dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and yes, she gets dressed once and then we got up again and again - a commentator said 17 times (I counted ten - but it would have been so bored from my mind so far) . I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave them are 1 for Lee and two for Mrs. Danning's contributions. Yuck!
