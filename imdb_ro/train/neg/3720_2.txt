Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? It's definitely not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is any intentional humor, but, a few times, the poor action, the weak direction and the terrible scenario have made the audience laugh out loud in cinema. The complaint is acceptable - a promising young artist who has just reached his dead shot dead by an assassin he leads by mistake. The killer sees the work portfolio of the young artists he carries and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. At the show, the assassin meets the sister of the dead artists and they fall in love. All things are very predictable, and the end will not have someone to guess because it's so badly written. The film takes place mainly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city is. Do not waste your time with this movie, unless you study how not to act, direct or write a movie!
