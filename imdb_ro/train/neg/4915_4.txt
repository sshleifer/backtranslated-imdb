One of the previous commentators has written that there seems to be no intermediate reason for the views on Love Story; he loves it or hates it. But there seems to be a remarkable cast of opinions across the scale from 1 to 10. For me, this movie has appreciated 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland turns into a fabulous job like Oliver's father. But the film did not make a particularly compelling job of telling the story, and the story was not so unique as to justify multiple views, at least not for me. Maybe I'm a snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet - because most, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc ?, in which his straightforward performance is the perfect emphasis of Barbra Streisand's protagonist - and, not coincidentally, makes a hit at Love Story for a good measure! McGraw and O'Neal tend to bury their lines rather than act. This movie is remarkable for the beginning of a good career: it was Tommy Lee Jones' first film.
