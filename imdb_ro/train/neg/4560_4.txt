Men in black 2 was a real disappointment for me. While actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, it's not a cure for a poor scenario when it was produced. The film had a sense of "continuity," playing the partial events of the first film. The story was, in a word ... bad, at best. It was not well thought out and seemed very tangled and sometimes incoherent. At the first move, the MIB Organization had a kind of "elite" force. You had some special agents and you felt something "clandestine." In sequel, the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp atmosphere. The film was not terrible or something else. It lacked only the "cool" (for lack of better expression) of the first film. Much of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second and did not bring any originality to the MIB universe. A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worthy to wear his title? Not realy.
