I feel it is my duty as a horror movie lover to warm people up on this terrible horror and horror movie. Do not waste your time or money on this movie, the act is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever met and the script was terrible. Nothing about it was good, you figured out why I was looking at these crap. The plot had so many holes in it and they were not clarified at all, it was so bad, I do not know how such a movie could be made so terrible. As I said earlier that I love horror movies and I was so disappointed, it was an 18, but you see little blood and do not scare or leap at all. Also, what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the movie that had no use at the plot, just like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all I can say. Just do not bother, there are many more horror movies out there, just do not waste your time is too short.
