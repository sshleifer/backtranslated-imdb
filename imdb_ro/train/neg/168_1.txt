Despite a decent first season, this series never approached the realization of its potential. Established as a prequel to the original "Star Trek" series, he was almost condemned by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt bound to limit and artificially restrict what a "Star Trek" series might be futuristic and increasingly anacronic from a dramatic point of view). Ronaldinho, Brannon Braga, did not help things uninspired and tedious remixing of previous Trek episodes and negligent ignorance of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious that he was just for salary). I have never seen a series that has consistently served a cast of talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock) for so long. It's like this series was produced in a balloon outside the contemporary landscape of television, where the audience (even the Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in its dramatic wishes and desires. Unfortunately, it seems Berman and Braga have been able to convince Paramount that "Enterprise" suffers from " franchise "and that its basic audience has not gone but has been eliminated. Create a quality offer that matches the ideals and high standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come in. Just put yourself in a the TeeVee universe where we have performances such as "Battlestar: Galactica" and "Shield," the powers that must be, must provide the visionary audience with a "Star Trek" that measures and is dramatic com It's just that simple and easy.
