This movie comes as a final disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. She escapes the laziness of every frame. So I will not analyze it completely. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why do we see the city's landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if it should mean anything in the metaphorical context of the movie (where the thirst notices the lust of intimacy and the watermelon trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a bad movie that does not give birth to being coherent. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she's unconscious or perhaps dead. It seems to be a matter of importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is fulfilled successfully, but in retrospect its inert body turns out to be a cheap dramaturgic trick, a pretext? as free and exploitative as the activity in which it is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing is expressed in this film that Antonioni did not express himself better 40 years ago? and without humiliating their actors unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from "The Hole") felt like an idea of ​​secondary artistic counterpoint, executed on that secondary school's high level of qualification. If this is the point, the point was sucked.
