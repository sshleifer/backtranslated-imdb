I saw it by chance, pointing to the cable that she wanted to like it, as I thought Sandra was pretty funny to what I remembered. The only facial movement we had along the movie was that the jaw fell amazed at how terrible it was a movie that I just suffered through. The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time, please indicate a line, just a scene, which even deserves a chicot. She is a much better singer than I remember to be, but I did not want to look at a lounge act. <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this is a movie that hardly tries to please because they think I should and do not see it objectively.
