As an ordinary film observer, I can not say I liked to see this. It's not too exciting for a drama that does not crash too much for a thriller, not too fast for action. In addition, some moments of the movie are hard to believe. OK, I understand, the soldiers are getting a little out of their minds there, but it's hard to believe that a person will risk their lives, a carjack in the middle of a hostile city, and after being called by a teacher's wife, a question (in an appropriate way). It would seem extremely romantic to me if it was an animation, but it should be a SERIOUS movie about war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes the impression it's just a preview of the movie and it takes a lot of work. It feels that movie makers wanted to create a picture of a brave emotional soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This image left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give him an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is the most thrilling part of the movie :)
