Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good cast of B-quality actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... that's about it! I think a guy from some anonymous marketing departments had an idea. Basically, it allows you to make a legal movie, but do it in New York. This great bright city of chances, strength and money and where everyone is a heart, power / money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, bimbo small town, that brother to Owen Wilson and to some for no obvious reason Andy Dick (only because of him you should ignore this movie). /> <br /> The boy leaves girl for NY, girl follows, boys live, the girl is in NY with her cousin, gets a job with false pretensions, beats up, is courted by another boy (brother Wilson) and together saves the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> Some words come to mind when reflected on this film, that is terrible, dreadful, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic. Just do not look at this movie, you'll be happier. A commentator referred to Guantanamo and certainly agree with him. This movie induces shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I'll see Simpson naked or close. It will not happen, it will waste time and YouTube on it. You will have more sexy time! Movie editing is thin, the act is unbearable, and why use blue screens? In conclusion; this is a cinematic betrayal that should be punished to the maximum <br /> <br /> Another question: why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father in almost all Jessica Simpson movies and why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?
