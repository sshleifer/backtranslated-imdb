This is not a good movie. Too many sermons in the parts and the line of story was under par. The 3D was ok but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie. The story is about three young flies who want to have an adventure and follow it. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is nothing to keep an adult interested. This is not Pixar. I'd love to see more special 3D effects. I also liked to see more model jokes than my mom constantly saying, "Lord Flies." Very sexist in showing women as homewives and fainting.
