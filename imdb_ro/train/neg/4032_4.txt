I've never heard of this before appearing on cable television. It's very typical for sci-fi in the late 1950s: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! In spite of the inclusion of a typical romantic couple, the film is presented in a documentary style - which is probably a cheap way to leave a lot of narration exposure and an excuse to insert as many posters as possible for what is unmistakably an extremely low business! Although it is not uninteresting in itself (the angle of the apocalypse-via-renegate missile, later used, with much greater aplomb, for both DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964] unintentionally laugh - especially in scenes involving an imminent birth and a gang of juvenile delinquent clueless!
