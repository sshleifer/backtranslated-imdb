I have seen this weekend opening the film in Australia, anticipating with an excellent interpretation of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that Ned Kelly's definitive story will take place in front of me. Unfortunately, despite the remarkable performance of Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was thin of paper ... that does not inspire me to read our "Sunshine". There were other plus points, support from Edgerton, assuring Jordan's direction (confirming his talent for the Buffalo Soldiers show) and production design that gave a real sense of hardness to the Australian bush, just like Immigrants Irishmen at the beginning of the nineteenth century must have seen it. But can not I feel that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folkloric hero (or was it?) ... in what I suspect is a Hollywood concession and the selling of the image in the US. Well, at least Jordan and the producers did not agree to lose their beard just to please Universal ... I think I will have to thank Peter Carey excellent "The Secret History of Kelly Banda." 4/10
