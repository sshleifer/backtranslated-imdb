The black candles are rather a terrible misery from the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others. We just noticed what I saw. In any case, we have a couple who makes love and then somewhere near a needle is put on a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man is spinning. I do not know if it was good for any of them at that time. Move quickly to the place where the human sister came to the house to investigate and hear the will or something, and of course, everyone else, except her, is in something that happens to be the worship of the devil. It's really hard to tell who's who at the moments of the movie and sometimes gets confused. However, to do things higher, there is a simulated simulated bestiality scene (I hope it is simulated) with a black goat, sure there is plenty of pleasure. Ugh. Sometimes, this "Baby Rosemary" echo, minus the baby, because the hostess always gives a female herbal tea, and the place falls in love with any ugly Satanic grasses, which are they too, because it continues to be remarked. However, herbs are not the only thing that comes back to this film. The end seems to be back at the beginning and many spectators may wonder where they were in the middle. It's not inexcusable, it's not very good, and I think everything depends on what you like to see in the movies and it was not too much here to do something for me. 3 out of 10.
