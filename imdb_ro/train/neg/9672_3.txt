While most of the movie is very amateur, the Kosher slaughter scene is played but not untrue. The Kosher Law says an animal must be aware when the blade touches the skin. The Kosher slaughter scene is exactly as someone knows who saw someone or saw the Peta movie showing a Kosher slaughter in which the animal's neck is cut and the esophagus cut while it's still alive, conscious and obviously suffering. We must remember that history is written by victory. Is it even allowed to even think that the Nazis were right? Do not say nothing that the Nazis outlawed this vicious religious sacrifice, and the Jews still practice it today?
