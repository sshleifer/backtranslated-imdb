Predictable, hackneyed & badly written. We foolishly argued that such a prominent distribution would only be involved if it had merit. I think the competition between actors is so intense these days (and you will get worse) that you can not choose and choose more. At first, we were given certainty that helped her assassinate, and since then we got stuck from my neck. The film had no intrigue, giving us a brief perspective on the victim and only a possible reason for the crime. Some speeches were, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that someone would consider, even to hire, to spend tens of millions of dollars to do so.
