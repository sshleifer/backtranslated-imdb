This is the biggest load of nonsense I have seen for a long time. The last time I hated a movie so long was watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There's absolutely no point in this movie, except for genuinely sick and twisted scenes, and Gillian Anderson releases to the side of the road, and every dialogue word must use the word "F" at least a few times in it. It has extremely cheap action and has a very low budget. My friend and I stopped the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save this cruelty. Do not look!
