This comedy, for which Peter Marshall (Joanne Dru's brother and later The Hollywood Squares perennial) and Tommy Noonan were hype as the "new Lewis and Martin" is just shy of horror: fast and nothing works properly - there is a scene where Noonan throws grenades at officers and politicians in anger; are about five feet away, Noonan throws them apart, and the total reaction is that everyone is wandering. In the midst of a terrible one, only by Julie Newmar, moments of brilliance: Marshall and Noonan engage in brutal occasions of double talk and arguments, and their time is almost perfect - clearly these were a pair of well-done comedies. It is not enough to save this turkey, alas.
