I'm not a big fan of the Stooges hammer, but I find history interesting. I recently tried to check things out of every age of Stooge, but the opportunity to see Joe's pants does not seem to be easy; this is the only one I've ever seen. Some say the quality issues with Joe's pants are not Joe's guilt and I suspect it is. Joe as an interpreter is far from the worst thing about it. The thing that bothers me most about this was highlighted in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the entire Stooges comedy / ethos team. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by those responsible that they did not really fit - though there were no real conflicts between him and the others - and that was their way of working around it. /> And what happens to the headlines and some of the other Stooges shorts? Clearly, a lack of creativity is happening there; Was that the cause or effect of the socks market that was drying up?
