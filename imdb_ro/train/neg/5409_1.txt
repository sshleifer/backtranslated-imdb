The Christmas Secret was presented as a wonderful film, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the movie when it's over, which makes me think the producers were very proud of this project. As a screen actor, I felt most of the shows were called, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not have put this movie on my resume. It was an embarrassment. I was a fan of Waltons' days, but I woke up trying to look at any of his later works, so poor was this offer. In the defense of the actors, the direction was sprinkled, mechanics, and I both did. I hope this is not considered an angry review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I filmed the movie because it had a good distribution and I was ready to enjoy the film. However, I would cause anyone there to watch this movie and not want her money back, even if she was on Tv.
