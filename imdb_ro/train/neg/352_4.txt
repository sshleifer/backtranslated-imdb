It seems that distribution should provide at least one medium film. And so I put 102 minutes of unbelief. Besides Ed Harris, nobody seems to have the ability to act. Even Sean Connery, whom he usually worshiped, should have had a free day during the entire Just Case movie. Not once during the whole movie, an actor could convince me. This made this movie look cheap and unreal. The story does little. It is thrilling, and the plot is unexpected. The conclusion is just watching this movie if you have nothing more useful to do.
