Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the genre of adult film. However, I did not like it at all. About a woman who sucks in a scene more suitable for a horror film, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the lust of life she has never done in her worldly life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they miserable because they try so hard to be artistic to take them from real sexual act. I mean, we're looking at pornography for sex. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course, the girls in that are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. If you find that the lead in your adult film is untouched, there is no artistic vision to make me enjoy the film. Sexual scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean there's a snake in one of them. So, for me, this movie fails, because it does not excite me at all, but rather stops me.
