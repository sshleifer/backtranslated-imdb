Peter Fonda is so intentionally grieved as an actor that his reading of the tear does not contradict any irony or humor in dialogue. Live sassy barbers and non-witch rehab with Brooke Shields as if it were a wooden block with retired hair; even his smaller touches (like fingers of a mustache not on his grimy face) do not reveal a character as much as an insecure actor being directed by himself, an insecure film producer. In the Southwest of 1950, a poor player (no less than a cheat) wins an orphaned Lolita who would have been a teenager in a crazy poker game; after winning a promising golden treasure map in Grand Canyon, the two seniors became prospectors. Some wonderful views and a strange, but interesting, cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon, are the only compensations in the tired comedy drama, the two causes being drawn by the caricature killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map . Shields is very nice, but although the camera loves her pocket, the beauty of the glossy, she has no presence in the screen (and her voice is in no way); every time he opens his mouth, someone is inclined to wander or beat. * 1/2 from ****
