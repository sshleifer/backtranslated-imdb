After seeing the remake of 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil punishing her for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was pretty funny and, in my opinion, better than the animated one. But, in fact, no second was needed. First, if Cruella returns, she does not cure her and does not make her crazy again. It just makes her move away from prison and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It is supposed to return only one original puppy. I expected it to be Lucky, because he was the most attractive and, in addition, they also turned Roger and Anita. However, they decided to make a complete reformation and add not just one hundred, not even one hundred two, but only three Dogs and a parrot who thinks it is a smart dog. Gerard Depardieu's part was useless. In the end, Cruella suffers far too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. Bake in a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first. That did not work. It was too much above the top, and not too funny. I'm sorry about Cruella.
