This is a confusing and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. This is not an exaggeration: you have to make an extraordinary effort to try even to get involved. I thought Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira is committing suicide at the end, but instead, in every scene someone tries to explain: "when he was young, that happened ..." and "just returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything there ... "etc. <Shortly in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse talking to a friend of a prostitute (certainly a slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little chat) and while telling Elvira's life story, Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course we come to the forced and gross symbol of "I've suffered a lot in my life and I'm about to die." In one of the rare moments when something happens, Erwin / Elvira faces a former boyfriend that only after performing a very homogeneous choreography with two other guys (as if going to the required level of homosexuality) is the fact that he recognizes Elvira. There are some interesting pictures and ideas, I have to admit (like when the young man tells about the young Erwin), but all about the film is wasted by Fassbinder's self-indulgence.
