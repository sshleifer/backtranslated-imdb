Although it is a R rating, I doubt you will really enjoy it if you are not a teenager. Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny joke. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie often has is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chickens (pretty nice that I could add) to celebrate your eyes. I do not really understand why this movie has the American Pie title, since it's just a bad combination of an erotic movie and a comedy without being one of them. My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chickens, but you are too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> Give it 1/10 for the 2 smiles we had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for cute puppies
