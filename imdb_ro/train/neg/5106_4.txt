ALIEN LOVE (How this movie is known in the UK) is a very strange movie. It does not mean that it's an esoteric art house in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, that is TVM with oath, sex, a very good T & A, a bad scenario and a very retro feel. Can you imagine someone like John Hughes, who had directed him ten years before, though, of course, he would give up T & A. Turning to the evil scenario, one of the problems is that few of the characters have any kind of motivation in particular Amanda. Why does Connie get to the bar? Just to meet an alien? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a lot of other films from the mid-1980s had this type of plot, most of them being more defined and convincing than those seen here. The story continues to follow a defective, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> That said I found ALIEN LOVE visible and not only until the T & A displayed. As a SF comedy is much better than FLESH GORDON and the EARTH EARTH IS EASY
