From a point of view and motion, this movie was terrible. I woke up looking at the clock in the theater hoping it would end and ease after the long 80 minutes she had done graciously. Basically, five characters appear in the film, One Son and Father, son son's friend, and two male characters of the age of the son who appear, and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing happened to reveal this one or the other. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the film, his son's girlfriend is at a window in front of the room and engages in a strange conversation. The photo and acting showed an incredible seduction of the interaction between the two, ending with admitting he had another "elderly" man. The end of that story.
