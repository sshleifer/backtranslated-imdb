There is never much for classic movies. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, how green was my Valley, the Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane wore me. However, I would prefer to watch any of these films 3,469 times as she was tied to a chair than to look at an American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I had done that, I would probably have slept all the time. The direction of color art and music did not interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dance and singing could help a fall of insomnia to sleep. Dialog does not match Singin 'in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I slept only 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Too bad we can not give zeros.)
