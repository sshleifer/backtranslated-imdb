KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I remember evaluating BOMB) was my introduction to the cult of Honda director; is not that necessarily better? just that I learned to be more tolerant towards such an intrinsic lowbrow rate! <br /> <br /> Here, we actually have two Kongs for the price of one: a huge and huge monkey and a robot variant that looks even worse! The simian creature lives on Mondo Island (!) ?? where he appeared to be fighting with a few other monsters and to befriend a trio of people. Naturally, it is the blond (and gentle) heroine; In fact, more interesting is a fatal female in cahoots with the crazy genius of the film? called Dr. Who and sporting anemic appearance and head, usually associated with a vampire! He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotize him to take over the Element X, which is embedded in the ice of the North Pole; apparently, giant waters are more radiation-proof than their mechanical counterpart (and, to ensure full co-operation, which captures even the three "comrades")! The female agent then has a heart change, helps the heroes (one of them is usually an insane American) and is killed by Cine. Kong finally escapes and makes it to Tokyo, where he has a final showdown with the robot. Doctor runs away from the chaos that appears in the sub? who, at the request of Kong's dream, is briefly shot by the giant monkey.
