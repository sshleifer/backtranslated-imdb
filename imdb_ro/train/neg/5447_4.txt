Only the hottest DORIS DAY fan could find this even bearable to watch. When someone thinks about the wealth of materials available for a story about the most famous blackout in New York City, a movie that could have copied with many stories about what people had to deal with, this scribbles the bottom of the barrel due to lack to tell the originality. Once again, Doris is indignant because she suspects she'd been compromised on the night of darkness when she returned to her homes in Connecticut, took a sleeping potion, and woke up in the morning with a man who did the same, trampling in the house from mistake. No one can save this mess - not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. Directed by Hy Averback, the worst car was the day she was in, hired to make the film because of her husband's machinations and unable to get out of her. Sin.
