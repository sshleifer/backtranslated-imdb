Since John Doe seems to inspire creator Kyle XY, I expected the pilot to be quite exciting. However, we probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed with it. First they turned the protagonist into a stranger who had the crazy idea of ​​showing his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area. So, after that scene, I started to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it has worsened since none of the other characters have been introduced correctly. They focused too much on John Doe, who made the story much less interesting. I was also a little disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance because I discovered he did not create a credible John Doe. Another problem was the police story. It was really felt like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant feeling. It leads us to the worst problem in the bouquet, the episodic format. I have already seen that the fillings come one after the other. So, overall, I was very disappointed with this and I do not recommend anyone. Considering how bad I was, I better understand why the show was canceled. In a way, I have the impression that he has lost his target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was a potential like the people he met at the club. Production quality was also good enough and proper casting. But I will never know if it would improve, probably not, because I do not intend to follow the next episode.
