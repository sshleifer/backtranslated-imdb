With MASSIVE advertising this happens on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that ilk, my son has bugging me to see it. Between DVDs and theaters, I have seen quite a lot so far from the remarkable ones (Incredibles, Shrek) to the very bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or kids. Was it a "when this stupid thing is over?" a kind of experience? OK, it's meant for small children (or, better, it's insulting the intelligence of anyone over 3 years old), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive and slow. Then, once you've finally fed, but you understand the movie is over, there's this bizarre thing at the end that you think is a joke, but it's not one - it's serious, though it's hard to say what try to achieve. The 3D effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, these are a big deal, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored to the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in all respects.
