A concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... Rudolph's shining nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this movie - just like the Force in Star Wars movies do not need the explanation of "doctors in the blood". But most of all, the movie left me sick because of Winterbolt's complicated plot to destroy Santa Claus. He has the power to put suggestions in people's minds, so why does things make such a sensible thing? Breaking Rudolph's nose magic, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the Frosty family ... The exaggerated comic stories of Pinky and Brain and Dr. Phineas and Ferb's Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are deliberately made and played for laughter) seem to be straightforward and direct to Winterbolt's, which we expect to take somewhat seriously. There is a strange (and fun) strange moment when a character throws the two weapons to the bad guy, such as boomerangs. I understand if they do not want to have guns shot in a family movie, but then why do they have weapons in the first place?
