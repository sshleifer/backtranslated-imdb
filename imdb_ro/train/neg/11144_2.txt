This move reminded me of those tricks of "erotic thrillers" that I used to stay up late and look at Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would label this softer motion because there is no simulated hammer and crushed. There is, however, a ton of nudity - the opening scene is in a comic club, we see Kane Hodder's keester (or at least one stunt hood) and then an inexplicable ten-minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and a nude female werewolf who looks as though they beat Munster for a suit. The 13-year-old boys are enjoying themselves. Besides, the werewolves' transformation scenes have the worst CGI I have seen for years. Photos show FMVs in the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained and, despite the poor quality of the costume, is shown too often. Plot and act do not make sense. There are some stories about the werewolves and the werewolves - Darkwolf is the last, but from what I can tell the hybrids do the same thing with all werewolves - it looks human, it changes to a wolf and a killer man. Darkwolf tries to find a pair, but strangely does not find his partner, but he can pull anyone who touches it. Once again, these skills prove to be less useful, since Darkwolf shows some people who never touched, did not meet, nor did they see how well they can say. The partner does not know this is a werewolf and is struggling with the transformation or something like that. You think it would be hard to get a simple monster movie bad like that, but well. Want a qualifying age-old werewolf, go for rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T & A, this is your movie.
