it's incredible! Fidani (who was also spiritism) was one of the cheapest directors around the world. This movie stole the original title of "Duck you sucker!" From Leone! but tells the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this film filmed in the expensive landscapes of Lazio. The story is bad and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not capable and ingenious at the same time. There are some crazy illogical things in the story (such as the talk in the sheriff's house and Butch Cassidy's dignified appearance, but really Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terrible American tongue, absurd behavior, illogical plot, bad action, and an escape from one of Italy's most revered anhormons, Renzo Arbore. Of course: Klaus Kinski. Yeah it's great and great, but I'm sure it was just for him and for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10, but ... DO NOT REPLY !!!!!
