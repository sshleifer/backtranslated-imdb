I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and appealing: each episode would be an hour of an hour, directed by a famous horror director. Then, when I finally watched them, it was a little letdown. Some good episodes came out of that first season, but overall it was a mixed bag. I attributed to the learning curve and I realized that season 2 would be much better. Well, I was in shock. At least one season had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (except "The Black Cat" with excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total and total loss to me. The "Sounds like" episode may be the worst thing I have seen on TV over the past 10 years and most other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 will turn this around next year, but I'm not breathing.
