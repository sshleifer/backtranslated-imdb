This is a movie that has had a lot to live with. In the year it was released, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and heard nothing but bad things about him, especially a criticized plot that was too complicated. honest plot is something of red herring, and the film suffers even more when using the word "plot" because, as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There is something that involves Russian gangsters, a character called Pete Thompson who is trying to get his wife, Sarah pregnant, and an Irish guy named Sean. How do they all fit into something called "plot"? I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the plot of Guy Ritchie's films, but if you follow any of his films, I'm sure we all agree that they all have one, no matter how complicated it would seem at first viewing. Also a James Bond movie, though the plots are full of action scenes. You will have a serious problem, believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has any kind of central plot that can be clearly explained. Looking at the distribution list, you will hear a number of warning bells about what kind of movie you will be watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and does nothing to make it inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name (and plays a character called Kant, who sums up the image of this movie), while one of the supporting characters is interpreted by a television presenter, probably because no serious actress will be seen dead in this one <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and, immediately after watching, I was going to write a very long period of critical review of people, which they were able to look at, but so far I forgot why. But that does not change the fact that I remember that I do not like this piece of nonsense
