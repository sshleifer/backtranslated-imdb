Two years ago at Sundance I loved the directorial debut of Josh Kornbluth - Haiku tunnel. I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) of Jacob, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good child growing up in a lower class area in New York. The film is not without its painful moments. But sometimes it's like Kornbluth is working too hard to make it clear: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not right. More subtle and more important is our understanding that, despite all these terrible cultural foundations and the antisocial behavior they can produce, these characters are not lacking in kindness and humanity. We can retrieve their language and their living conditions, but we can not reduce their intention. And, in fact, their struggles to maintain a family in such adversity have a certain degree of nobility that most of us can hardly appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for people is obvious along the way. After saying all this, the world's best thief suffers from many painful defects (including the title). Characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the plot line is barely discovered. And for many, the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys who imitate gangsta rap between scenes. For each one of them: But while I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, I am frightened to see the 5-year-olds mf'ing and talking about having sex with a number of women. It is a useless shock value and is a little forced by borrowed interest.
