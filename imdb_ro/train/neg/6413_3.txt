My friends and I got into this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When I came out, I was just a little more informed about what the plot of the film was actually about. Although not the worst movie I've ever seen, I certainly do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. You may have a friend leased for you (not even worth the cost of renting) if you really want to see it. When a movie is so convinced you have no idea what's going on until the last five minutes, there really are not many things that can be put in defense. The act was decent, more than you would expect to get from this film, and some of the photos were good, but it was stunned by a blade plot and a poor scenario. This movie was so bad that as soon as she left, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just to clean my mind. We recommend that you all go over the first step and see a good film instead.
