In 15 minutes, my whole family is rooted for Goldie Hawn's character to die or at least for Steve Martin's character to leave her. At 40 minutes, I stopped it. There are only a few movies a year that we are trying to get so annoying that we can not even stomach long enough for the story to settle. Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying Neil Simon's original. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director "What's Worst to Happen" and the writer "Miss Congeniality 2," and I think that's what we get.
