The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the shooting James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway Cameron Diaz tries to get out of frame as soon as he can (successfully), does not ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their embarrassment with these dirty stuff. Provides an endless dialogue with little meaning and action. Tulsa is a city with beautiful lobbies for lifts, a deco art house by Bruce Goff and a lovely mansion set by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not make room for justice.
