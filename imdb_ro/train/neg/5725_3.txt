2005 gave us a very decent "gore porn" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Feed Live; a not so decent fun of the Hostel. Live Feed follows almost the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, except that these children are in Asia rather than in Central Europe. The park focuses on these stupid kids, and one of them has bothered one of the locals, so they are in trouble. The locals decide to close everyone in a theater and kill them. Despite the fact that I heard some less favorable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped it could be at least decent, because director Ryan Nicholson previously shot the 45-minute "Torched" the film falls just because most are either ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to return to the old days of the Grindhouse cinema (which the Hostel did successfully), but it really does not break. Surprisingly, given Nicholson's previous work in special effects - it is not even impressive for the gore ... though it is much better than acting! I can not say anything about this movie anymore ... it's bad and it's not in a good way. Avoid it!
