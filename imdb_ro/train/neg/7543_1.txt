A trooper is on the roadside, making sure everyone obeys the speed limit (he does his job); he then shoots over a woman who seems to be a mother (there is a baby in the back seat); he then tells him what is bad and BAM ... they are killed. Okay, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would have been a good movie. When I looked at this movie in the theater I was with some friends. It was our first night after the summer, so we wanted to see a good movie. We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes in my life. Not only did I lose $ 7,000 on a movie ticket, but I had to stay tortured for the brain. This movie started with mystery and suspense, and I seriously thought "this cant be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole issue with this movie is that it does not make sense; even if you manage to live as a bad act, the story "not so frightening" and the misery of everything this movie has been, you will still be puzzled. Not because you're not smart enough to understand this, because no man with a brain can understand what the stupid film means. Right now you might think, "Man, I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as that person says it is." CHOOSE YOU TO HELP YOU FROM YOUR CAPTURE I'm trying to save you the difficulty of watching this movie, telling you it's so bad that it makes no sense to think about it. Please do not make the same mistake, I thought this movie has potential ... no. I give this movie 1 in 10 (if I could give a zero I would like) and I do not recommend that nobody ever see this movie, you will save many sleepless nights, trying to think w.t.f. that the frantic film is about.
