The movie must have been shot one day, there are scenes where you can see the camera's reflections and its red indicator, even the green light of the landscape that mixes with the actors !!! Plot and lines are really terrible without even the slightest inspiration (at least as a thriller movie). Everything that has to do with Poe in the film has a superficial and childlike approach. The film is full of clich√©s and without thrill. If you want to watch a funny movie b for a relaxing evening with friends, then go because you enjoy it (as I did) but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
