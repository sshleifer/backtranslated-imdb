There is a very good film that hides just under the surface of the layers on the cheese layers that is "Pagemaster". I learned this when I looked again this morning after I neglected it for years and years. I remember hating her when it first came out, but this time I found that the special effects are pretty good. The plot is just the "Neverending Story" with an endectomy of creativity, but it's a short move for anyone who just wants a wonderful candy-eye. The animation is amazing and I especially liked the way the animators let their characters look and act a little more surreal than the norm. I give her a note of three, as I would have given her (just for parody value) if I ever decided to look at this movie waiting for my story to blossom.
