I have to say that I was a big fan of the show. The first 3 were wonderful and the others had moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is a shame, because this was a great series and continues to get worse. I know they're made for DVD movies, but an effort would be nice. They're not laughing, just a couple of good pairs that will make a smile if that's what. There is quite nudity and very hot chicks. But neither sexy things nor jokes really work. To add to all that it's a RACIST movie too or a racist of a movie, it can be done without asking you to be called a racist. I am not one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive. I would not waste time with this garbage. See previous versions, make you laugh is not sick.
