I thought this movie was pretty lame. If you are looking for cheese, you may like it. I myself do not mind a good amount of cheese, but that was ridiculous. The progression of the movie bored me and the story was very poor. The only thing to have fun about this movie was zombie-day, but even that's not enough to see this movie.
