This title seems more like a shooting exercise than a movie that should have been released to be seen by the audience. For Dafoe and his wife, it must have been fun to work together in a movie for the first time, not to mention the fact that people might really look at it. I felt that 90 minutes had been lost while I was eagerly waiting for a plot to develop or even begin. Try to match this movie to a genre and you will not do it, because it does not have a beginning, or it ends. I have seen movies "arty" before and this does not even approach being artistic, abstract or original, seems to me to be completely useless. I think I speak for myself when the only people who rated this movie were 10 under 18. Undoubtedly for the constant and useless erotic scenes that the film insisted on casting on us. That if you can call her erotic. Definitely it did not taste.
