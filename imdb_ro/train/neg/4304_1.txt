This is an anti-Serbian propaganda film made for television. "Muslims are good, Orthodox Christian Serbs are good." <br /> <br /> That's the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to get a propaganda message is nothing new. This film puts it thick. </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> 500 American soldiers were injured by the Germans during the Second World War. Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and support the British behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed the example and, as a result, after the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to Communist Tito. And the American ally Milhalovitch has been blurred by the media ever since. The film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), culminating in Kosovo's "war" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of wholly false statements by ICG about "" in Kosovo full of "victims" of ugly Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves, and Albanians (Muslims) had no business in Kosovo in Serbia, are facts that most newspapers will not print. I chose this movie to watch because the description of a single thesis on the video cover seemed interesting. Imagine my disgust when I found out that we were fooled to rent another branch of the propaganda machine destined for Serbia. from this propaganda somebody should make a film about Clinton's unwillingness to come clean with Congress and the American people about his complicity in delivering weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. > I will not hold my breath waiting for such a movie.
