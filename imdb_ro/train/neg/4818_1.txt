I was 7 years old when MONSTROSIT was released. In the UK, it was broadcast on TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were an incredibly blockbuster movie. It was actually the first movie I've ever seen at a cinema and I've been left to go for years. The next week I was invited to visit the new Star Wars movie and refused. Until now, I have never seen it before, in protest of the fact that I have to look at Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7, I could say I was looking at the garbage. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Nonsense of luck, who NEVER had to do it at a cinema. I was, however, amused to read all these years later that the director never directed, as well as I did. WATCH AT ALL COSTS!
