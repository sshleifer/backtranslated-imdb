This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see this tonight ... on the first day, because anticipation and hype were too much for me. But in the first half an hour, I knew it was a disaster. Not only does it not fit with the created hype, it also insults the original blockbuster. The script had gaps, editing was blurred several times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor, did a good job. Amitabh was okay .. the director wanted to describe how bad his character is, but he went a little overboard, which led to a force. Ajay, who is particularly unclear in these roles, was also a disappointment. Let's not even start with the new Prashant guy ... he would not be proud to start a career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was cast for a few laughs, could not even smile on anyone because of forced humor and the voice shouting. Nisha Kothari proved to be one of the worst actresses today. Generally, RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors that India had ... failed. He took such a challenge and responsibility so great to remake what is known as the best Hindu film ever and made a mess of it.
