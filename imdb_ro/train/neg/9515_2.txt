OK, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine this being better with subtitles. All I have to say is that this is the most boring movie I've seen for a long time. There is almost no ransom quality for this movie. That's why I do not understand all the positive reviews. It could be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are best left untold. I usually liked slow-motion movies as long as it serves the purpose of the film. Tarkovsky's sun is extremely slow, but it allows introspection and setting the mood of the film, for example. But in this case, the film is just filmed with a mindless dialogue that can tell us a little about the characters. None of which I could identify or interest me. In many scenes I woke up thinking, "When will they stop"? The act was pretty bad. Not in a clear way. But it seems that none of the actors cared for their characters and they all seemed to want to be elsewhere in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue that has been given to them. Also, the entire film flow has been quite mechanically felt. Moving from one scene to another. It seems that this movie was just written (bad), but it has never been touched. This is one of the few movies I can tell you have not generated an emotional response from any of the scenes. No suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sadness, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest so much. A perfect example of what I call an anti-film.
