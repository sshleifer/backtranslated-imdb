What can he say about this movie, other than "look at the viewer". The evil Christmas should come with a warning label, such as cigarettes, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely dissatisfied with a horror movie "b", but this film could not bring even hope at the age of five. The point of an infinite madman who has a thirst for blood in a movie is that he should seem close to God as though nothing can stop manic rage, but in this film the resident psychopath locks in a horn in a bizarre attempt to surprise the next victim and, of course, to follow the popular legend of Santa Claus, it is a reminder to the spectator that this man is by no means dangerous because it is too bad to be dangerous. All in all a total loss of film.
