I watched this movie after I saw other comments on IMDb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie". I wanted to like this movie, but it did not work. The "Love Story" was good, but the look of horror was pretty bad. If the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a parasomnian girl, then it would have been a better movie. The care center has spread the credulity far beyond the limits, in fact it was ridiculous. The practitioner happily ignores the privacy and professionalism laws. A nurse enters a room for a routine patient's food (without security escort) and drops the tray and leaves the room screaming for no apparent reason. The criminologist (and the villain of the movie) is tied up in a fully dressed position - apparently for years? None make any sense. The film even had actors who liked me in other things, such as detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
