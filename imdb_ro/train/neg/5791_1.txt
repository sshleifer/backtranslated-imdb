As a native film teacher, I can honestly say that this is probably one of the worst movies with native content I've ever seen. I would prefer to receive a root channel than to see this movie again. Using stereotypes, non-critical attempts to use portions of traditional coyote stories and working in an inappropriate room has only worsened by the glib, the ungrateful story and the evil scenario. The writer and director presented the most serious parts of a colonized approach to illustrate indigenous peoples and communities. If this person is Native, they have to go home and apologize to everyone they know because they are apples and internalized racism, and for a poor sense of humor they have developed. If this person is not native, he must seriously reconsider his white privilege and ask himself whether he has an unexamined, unintentional racism or intentionally ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors in this movie had a good time and at least they were paid for their efforts. If you want to see good original movies then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Me Out, Medicine, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... to name just a few.
