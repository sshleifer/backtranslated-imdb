This move reminded me of my stories from the Crypt Guard. He has the same idea that people get what they deserve. I think they're always in a story about Crypt. The same goes for bad action. Very bad action. I liked the movie knowing that most people did not like it and did not expect too much. Whenever I watch a movie by Stephen King, I do not expect much because all his films are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I like how Carrie played as if it were a true story, and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories, and so on. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were nothing like movies. The finalizations were very different from the movie versions. I assume from the two novels that all of his novels have changed a lot and that the endings are always cheesy. The end of the Thinner is the worst. So, Cheesy. I want to read the book to find the real final. I suggest to all those who intend to read Stephen King's novels to watch their films before hand, so they can compare. And this way you will be very pleased with the book. I intend to do this with all of his novels that have been made in movies. I'm sure if they were made in movies, they were really good books ... and the script was terribly wrong.
