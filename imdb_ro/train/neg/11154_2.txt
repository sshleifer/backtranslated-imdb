This movement was on TV last night. I think it's a filling time, because it suffocates bad! The film is just an excuse to show a few boobs and the ass at the beginning and somewhere half way. (There are nonsense and nonsense). But the story is too ridiculous for words. "The wolf," if that's what you can call it, is hard to show in full to save his teeth. When you see it fully, you can clearly see that there have been some CGI trainees because the wolf is running like running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur seems to have been waxed, all bright :) <br /> <The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily see who will still be killed / cut / eaten. Even if you like these brilliant movies, you will be disappointed, did not do a good job of doing this. I do not even start with the actors ... girls scream at everything every 5 seconds. But then, again, if someone asked me to do bad action just to give me some money, then, hey, where do I join? Horror general and boring.
