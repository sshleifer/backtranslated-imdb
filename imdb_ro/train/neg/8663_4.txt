Only when you thought it safe to get back into the water ... Another computer created a mutant crisp on the bow for the human lunch, left free from one of those facilities that lead crazy science. Gereco Biotech is fooling with growth hormone research by accidentally releasing a crocodile for children that evolves at an accelerated rate. B-movie brings fun in this monster movie run. Costas Mandylor recalls Mick Dundee, the Australian accent, the hat, the big knife, the work as a crook specialist employed by Gereco, executive Joanna Pacula (lost to the stereotyped role of the corrupt executive, denying any involvement with the giant beast released to innocent people) . Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose city is in jeopardy, and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter working on the animal shelter. The soap opera Matthew Borlenghi is the interest of Longenecker's love, a local artist who collects sculptures (his brother is a crocodile victim). Of course, this skill will be useful when our heroes created a trap created for croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. The Croc itself is never convincing, through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low-grade variety. As for Roger Corman's productions of renegade dynasties, they are with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on the hind legs, often straight, while pursuing potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and the directors fake Crocodile Dundee with the crocodile hunter, and this imitation could amuse the place where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets his hilarious comrade (gulp).
