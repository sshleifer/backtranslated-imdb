Sistas in the hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except da hood is a wild west city in the late 1800s. I do not remember any Western like this when I was raised. What would Randolph Scott say? If he had seen Lil 'Kim, he could have said, "Okay, I have to admit I did this just to see it ... Midriff balls and cut blouses are not the basic ones of the usual cowboy, but these are cowgirls, and I'm fine Now, do not look for any important story here, and the usual ghetto crime drama is here in a different setting And when you've heard the last time John Wayne is calling someone, Dawg "? And I do not remember Earp Brothers hugging and kissing before going to OK Corral.I'm looking at BET, so I lost the action I got is a R rating but I doubt if I buy a DVD to see if I can not be sure Lil Kim was in that action.
