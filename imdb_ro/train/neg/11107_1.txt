It was a terrible movie. There was no story line. At first, when they could not explain the blood and the gorilla (the only good part) ... they threw in a few strangers! I hate when the directors (or anything else) have no ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But I'm not saying I did not warn you. Two things: How could Vinny say "welcome" when he did not have a tongue? Too bad Mr. Jones did not have a bigger role. The second thing we bothered, why I told Vinny Jones the heat and cut them off and put them in a blue liquid, and they did not work anymore. Why not? I do not like to show anything, and this has nothing to do with the story line. In short. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I wanted to watch the Mirrors instead.
