The film starts with promise, but it remains too long in a sepiatic world of distance and alienation. I'm hanging but nothing else saves slow photos of the faces of the males and the men so proud to enjoy. Of course, we no longer have the rope in the wall to help us climb. It is a shame, because the concept is worthless. I was wondering why a loving couple - a father and son no less - should be so alienated from the real world that the world of itself is preferable when claustrophobia beyond all imagining. This loss of presence in the real world is rather too obvious and useless in contrast to the son who entered the armed forces. Why do not the circus, so we can appreciate the color a little? I'm left with a sense of loss, but unfortunately, no illumination, which is amazing in view of the film, is apparently about a form of accomplishment that is not available to all of us.
