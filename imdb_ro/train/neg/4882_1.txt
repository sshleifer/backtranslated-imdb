There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are quite fun. "Criminal Insane 1" was one of those blows. So bad that it was nice and had a re-watch value. "Criminal Insane 2" must be one of the worst films ever made by me, who say a lot, because I'm not the type of person to say is the worst. But believe me, this was totally awful and running only 1 hour is an hour too long. The movie has a fairly incoherent story, but cares about the story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running through killing people because it's not fed. Well, you do not see this in this movie, except for all the retrospective sequences in the first. The new story could have been very funny because Ethel was sent to a middle-class house and killed everyone, but nothing happened until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that time were already asleep. > The camera in this movie is just atrocious. This literally reminds me of something I shot with the friends behind me when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is different, as you do not understand any word that most characters say. To give an example of how bad it is, get into a subway in New York and try to understand what is said over voice speakers, that's what this movie sounds like. It does not matter what he's talking about anyway, because the actors are as dry as a piece of dead wood. Now I know that saying that this is the worst movie that is quite harsh, but the words can not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, you see it for yourself. 1/10
