*** SPOILERI *** *** SPOILERI *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> From there, the whole movie crashes on itself. First we find a dishonest program, indicating that we will get ghosts, vampires and werewolves and so on. We have a guy with a retarded accent that talks about endless rubbish, two "ghosts" that do not serve any real purpose, and they have no character and a lot of scoffers. Someone told me they were vampires (directly from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not realize it. The funny guy with a ridiculous name suffers from the same problem as Oracle, only for much more and much worse. It has a simple point about cause and effect, it does it, then it continues to do it and make it until it becomes complicated and bad. His final line before walking is comparable to that of Storm, "you know what's going on with a frog ..." among the X-men, in levels of nothingness. Chocolate cake is a lazy, pathetic paella, and Monica Bellucci, as a wife, does nothing but what we expect when we see it. And then we get another fight with kung fu! WHY? Neo is, supposedly, The One. He can do anything. He has the supreme power and for what he uses it. Kung bloody was all the time. And while he can stop 1,000 bullets, he is still cut by the sword and makes a mass of 5 undetectable flakes (vampires?). I wanted to see the powers of mind. I wanted to see him make the wildest, the fools, the fools, for the people, because he can do anything. I got the same thing as before without "wow". Fabulous hunting machine. That can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. I just was not what I was, it will be. ALL of the cool photos in this scene are in the trailer. Everyone. So every possible Wow was taken from us so that all we have now is a good succession of guessing what, a kung fu fight! OK, it's not Neo, but you would have thought he'd explain to your closest friends about the reality of the Matrix. At least he taught them something. It is not difficult. Morpheus, do not worry about what's happening to you in the matrix, it's not real, as long as you understand that nothing is real, then nothing can do you harm. "There you go It's so bothersome and yet it gets worse The last climax of the movie is probably the worst imaginable They have the whole elaborate plan , which involves three crews, then they only show sporadically between Morpheus's long-lasting monopoly, super-preaching, monologue, to make it worse, they never define clearly what this plan needs of 3 teams. , but you do not know who does what, when when a team descends, you do not care and do not know how it will affect what's going on. /> I'll sum it up, however, it happens that Trinity can return to Matrix to establish the end. This is the only reason to Whatever the question, why did they initially have to send 6 people? Trinity enters in five minutes of herself! Neo's journey to the Matrix center (so to speak) is treated as lazy. Ooohhh !!! He enters another Smith 100 agent! Woooooo !!! I probably thought a lot. Just now I'm on a corridor so the fight does not have a scale and ends in a moment. Man, what a final one! <br /> <br /> And then the architect! Remember everything I said was bad about Oracle and the stranger? Add them together and double them, so the architect is really terrible. His only reasonable potential is that he is about to set the climax of cliffhanging. And then blow it! Let's look at the options he gives to Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and all the humanity dies! Given the choice is something that this movie is trying to explore, it does not really give it a hero. If he had a choice between saving mankind and dying the heir or saving laughter and killing humanity, there is the pot for torment and inner tension. Also, with the Trinity being in the middle of autumn, the potential of a real cliffhanger that would have made the third one more important. But no. He did not save anyone and did not save Missus. Now the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo's death and then the return to life at the very end. The year he went out, everyone was so mad at how bad Jar Jar was that they did not notice that at the end of The Matrix they made him look at Steven Hawking. "The oracle told me that I will fall in love with One, and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How could the whole world have lost how terrible that was? So what's Wachowski doing next? Well, they make the finish of the original look better. How? Well, doing the same thing again (only the changing characters), it's just so much worse I think my keys will be used if I continue to write long before it gets worse. The cliffhanger is not even a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. Basically, this movie is bad. I really did not mean to be bad, but it is. Bad in many ways. And to make things worse, it's not a poor budget movie. It's not a movie with a short program. It's not a movie that's been pulled out. It's not a movie where too much influence came from outside. That's exactly the movie that Wachowski started with Warner's fortune fully behind them. And that's what makes this so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say he did not have enough time or money. Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not really. The most disappointing film ever made. <br /> <br /> Inevitably. <br /> <br />
