This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the twin connection feels something is wrong with her sister. This movie has always lasted to establish the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The act was terrible for the most part. Once the script meets, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with an abusive father. Father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura is to blame for everything. There is a promise that girls would never be separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a dinner where she meets Barry, a married man. Naturally, nothing can come of it. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse for a way to follow him. I expected this movie to improve and there to have a certain resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
