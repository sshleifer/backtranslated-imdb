Also, the opening magazine was nice, in a way it was made before-but-still-funny way. And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and comes from someone who's not Billy Connolly's big fan: Movie Star. I just had this fear that she would grumble and try to steal every scene, but played pretty little for him and probably came out of the most sympathetic character in the whole movie. > Everything, not wonderful.
