for a lot of time I was anxious to see this movie here in Latinamerica Japanese or any Eastern movies have no distribution in the theaters, we can find some of these movies in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something good, but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, simply stupid, with lots of unnecessary scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time even writing about this movie. Sorry, but it's the truth.
