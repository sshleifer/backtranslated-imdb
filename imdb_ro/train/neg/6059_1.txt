I have to say that being a fan of the man who created the Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best movies. Then you got this POS. I can not reasonably believe that he has made every effort in this respect as in the case of cigarette burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. You have to look at this from the point of view that it did not look like a movie. Like someone else would have guided her for one thing. I can not believe Carpenter has made every effort to do that. I just listened to the old soundtrack of the H2 / H3 / The Fog school and it was great, especially for the times. > <br /> He used a style that no one had and worked so well for his movies.
