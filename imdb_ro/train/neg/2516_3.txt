Unfortunately, I do not remember the book, but I remember that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film is a typical German low quality production. I do not care - though the story itself is good, it's just badly adapted. In the center of misery are the characters that are overly simplified and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even well-known German actors, Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy, can not save this poor performance. However, there is hope ... I was told that the films that follow are becoming better and better. In conclusion, I have to say that this film does not deserve the cinematic screen, but it may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
