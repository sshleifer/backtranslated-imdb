Student Seduction finds rescued by Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the office and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking by myself, I can honestly say that no teacher ever saves something done for me hormonal back when I was a student. This was Mrs. Diaz who was a music teacher at Junior High School. Even a gay couple, I could see what he was doing with the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had, which could have been played in any way by Elizabeth Berkley. Corey being hot is also accustomed to having his own way with women if they agree or not. The fact that it comes from rich parents strengthens that belief. He does chemistry, which is what Berkley teaches and keep GPA up, she agrees with the tutor, but I do not believe much. <br /> <br /> So when he tries a rape and does not get an answer, it is damaging to his ego. When Berkley gets out of the canals and reports the police murder, the policemen who take into account the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just do not think here. Sevier's parents have the means to get good publicity for this for their boy. Student Seduction, which is a defamed title for a title if there ever was one, is garbage all the way. After the beats that Berkley took for Showgirls, this TV movie was not an upward move of the career.
