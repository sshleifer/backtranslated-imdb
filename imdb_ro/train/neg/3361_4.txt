This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made ,,,, it had everything to make a great movie. Incredible action, great special effects ...... oh waiting I have to think of a good movie. Well, it was not one of them, but just aspired. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is what kind of head of a bitch would think this movie was 10. When I voted 206 there, God knows what's going on in their heads. Now, like any other vote, an 8 or 9 was really too big, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie so good to give a 10? I know they are the same people who think Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
