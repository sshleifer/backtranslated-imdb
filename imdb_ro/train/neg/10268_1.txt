Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever lost money! The plot is, I'm sorry, I said it was a plot? The most frightening moment was when ... you can not think of one! The best special effect I hid under the bed was ... I can not even think of one for that. You knew who the killer was from the very beginning. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact, the only two interesting vague bits were when you saw the child's sister, Misty, in the shower, and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her upstairs. This movie should be watched only to get an idea of ​​how not to make a horror movie!
