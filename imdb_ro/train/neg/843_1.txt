A "subculture" of Los Angeles BDSM serves as the backdrop for this low budget and a mess, clearly a piece of vanity for the best paid player, Celia Xavier, who also produces scenarios while fulfilling a double role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia. A question soon arises as to whether some camera rooms, light and editing, rather immoral, can ever reach a point of connection to a poor and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensitive viewer. Celia is hired as a highly motivated probation officer in Los Angeles County, while her evil twins have become an iconic figure in her fetishist world, largely due to her erotic CD-ROM performance, but when the disaster is "Mistress Vanessa" Celia, determined to discover her sister's victorious striker, is starting a new job as a "sex slave" at the private club in the castle, where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party." Two FBI field agents (whose involvement in Vanessa is impressed by their involvement in BDSM websites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department's homicide detective, are designated to investigate the crime by trying at the same time to provide security for all the enthusiasm of performance in her new vocation is considered quite avid by her clients to have created personal dangers for her. Defects in logic and continuity abound, such as a murder that is attributed to South-South Operations within L.A.P.D., a region of the metropolis that is far from setting the film. The direction is unfocused and is not helped by post-production editing and sound reproduction. The aforesaid gymnastics culminates with a frightening fit, near the end of the film, which is relatively tangential to the scenario. There is a solid twist amongst this slag: Stan Abe, as a zealous agent of the FBI.
