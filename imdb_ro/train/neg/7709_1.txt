You never see this movie. Try to be a spoof on the sci-fi / thriller movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but everything that sucks makes you really want to look at one of them and not one. <br /> <br /> It's very lame. A spoof must have a look that is of a certain superior quality. This movie does not look like this. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... do not look at her.
