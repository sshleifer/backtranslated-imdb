Rich widow Anthony Steffen (like Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochist boyfriend, and British lord. He brings sexy women with red hair to his castle where he whips and kills them. Erika Blanc (as Susie) becomes temporary. Mister. Steffen is haunted by his wife, Evelyn, who died at birth. As a therapy, she decides to marry again after meeting with beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). By the end of the movie, they will have to dig further tombs. "The Night Evelyn went out of the grave" is the best title, at least. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
