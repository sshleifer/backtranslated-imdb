Not since I Caligula Caligula thinking he stopped the movie halfway ... but then with it, I was only 15 minutes when I thought. Unfortunately, we did it all the way. Make sure you do not. It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or scary or scary or scary or sexual. There's none of those things, but all the more they all want to be. Instead, it is boring, banal, ordinary, predictable and, exceptionally, badly executed (filmed, special high school effects, no sense of visual narrative, barely audible dialogue ... not that it deserves to hear, though). /> <br /> This film is proof of the argument that even direct-to-video distributors have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
