Armand Louque (played with veteran character character Dean Jagger in a rare role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls for the wonderful Claire Duval (who brings the blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the gentle kernel to get Armand's colleague, Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland of hopeless wood), to marry her. Angry, being used and refused by Claire, Armand uses his voodoo skills to take revenge. Interesting sound? Of course it is not. For starters, Victor Halperin's static (non) direction allows the meandered and debating story to unfold at a slow pace. Worse, Halperin fails to bring tension, atmosphere, and impetus to hidden procedures. Most blah, acting from a largely insipid distribution, does not help; only George Cleveland, as a general heart, Duval and E. Alyn Warren, as drunken Dr. Trevissant, manage to multiply things a little with their benevolent and refreshing histrionics. The scores in the drop-drop library, painful scene sets and raw cinema are pretty stupid and unimpressive. In fact, this feeble excuse for a frightening trait is so frightening that even the unbelieving eyes, with the charming eyes of the great Bela Lugosi, can alleviate boredom that damages the brain. A weird boring one.
