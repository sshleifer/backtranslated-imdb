Warning Tracking followers. Superb recreation of the Antarctic base, where the real events of the film took place. Besides, slanderous, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; probably by a largely Canadian and distributed team. I caught the last half of this recent film on global television in Canada. Nothing to say except how profoundly I was to what was a blatant patch of American Revisionist historical propaganda; and tries Susan Sarandon of all the people! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make the USAF movie heroes when in fact the real saviors, if a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
