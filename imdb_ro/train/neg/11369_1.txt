That's pretty ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live everywhere in the US, U.K and around the world. Religion has over one billion followers. I myself was born and I ate bread in America, and through my religious courses and teachings I was taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to society. I'm very dedicated to my religion survivors and teachings have been stressed through the life of educating and preparing for success through education to contribute back to the world. I met many Muslims from all over the world and I traveled to countries like Pakistan ... I met another person who thinks we should hurt someone or accept other religions except those in the media ... I wonder why ... Also, it is sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion. It is a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent, I'm sure other people in other religions would not want to be represented by the KKK, the IRA and many others who are extremely simple extremists who use outdated and no literal passages of the respected books to pursue their own revenge, personal or business problems through their so-called religion
