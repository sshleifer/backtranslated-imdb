Now, I've seen many bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and I have enjoyed) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including the one in which the clone is, both of which play twins, and all three where is a cyborg. In fact, they have the place where a fashion designer plays and fights in a truck full of duriani. (Hey, if nothing else, has a big ass and almost always see it. With DVD you can even pause and enlarge!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, does the Plan 9 to look like Citizen Kane. Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The land is bad. The scenario is bad. The sets are bad. Fights are bad. Cascades are bad. FX are bad. The actress is spectacular over the past, most likely posing the worst performances of each of the so-called actors in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that really says something. And I'd be willing to bet that everyone involved in this movie is stupid in bed to load it. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It manages to be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are a congenital idiot or very, very crushed. I managed to stay alone by it because I needed to look at something that would distract me from washing my cat's urine in my laundry. It did not help too much, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's role as a gay burner.
