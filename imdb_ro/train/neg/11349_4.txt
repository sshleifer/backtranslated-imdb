In fact, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3d animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. And Bug's life did not do that? I think she was at Disneyworld on that tree, so I say before going and using it as a logo. Also, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should consider it another movie because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least they were little kids. I liked the IQ. I agree with the animaster, they have made a job of God to make a movie out of something that is just an outdoor adventure. I recommend families and children.
