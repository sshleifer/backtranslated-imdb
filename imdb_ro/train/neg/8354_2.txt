Any movie in which Brooke Shields comes out of a Fonda will be both an anomaly and a horror. Shields is actually bad just because it is young, inexperienced and obviously not well directed by co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, well, because it's bad. I liked Ulee's gold years later, but the Lord above is terrible here. Not that someone else is good. There is only one interpretation (outside the delightful Henry Fonda's house), which is even acceptable. I've never seen a movie with many such bad performances. If Luke Askew, the main villain is clear that this is due to weak dialogue and direction because he did a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing sound. Writing is terrible, and actors can not be condemned for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! Editing and direction are worse than pedestrians. Photos are held for too long without any dramatic reason or cut before the impact of the scene can be achieved. This picture was much worse than I imagined it would have been completely forgotten (and perhaps never made) without the participation of some familiar names. One bright spot: Cinema Grand Canyon is great, capturing the beauty of that area in some way, even if high production yields Imax have not done too well. And finally: whether it is a version of improper Paper Moon with a nice pair of male-daughter, or a version unpleasant Pretty Baby, a relationship considerably romantic of a person of forty-something years old . This suggests several of the latter than the former and is therefore quite disturbing.
