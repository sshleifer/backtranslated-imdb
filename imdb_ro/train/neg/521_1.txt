Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can not imagine how anyone could have read this stupid script and would have given her the green light. The distribution is uniformly second, with some truly terrible performances from almost all of the distribution. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. Talking, lead and predictable. No spirit, no charm, no humor. Not even sexy. Characters remain as flat as proverbial rinsing. There is also a strong current of misogynism that has become more and more difficult to stomach as the movie continued. When your leader (Carrell) is unhappy and untouchable, he is up there. Despite the fact that the false overthrow is over, where love triumphs over the lust, we have a sick feeling in the stomach. If this is what passes for humor and social commentary, then we are certainly condemned.
