After seeing Versus before, I had great hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Alive did not deliver it. Very slow development. Potential charges with distribution and cold images. The premise was intriguing, but the gain did not compensate for the accumulation. He could do much more at the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". To make it clear, three of us were ample sitting and watching this movie and at 50 minutes we tried to make it to the end. It took several elements of shock. If you are looking for Ichi Killer or Versus type fights, then save some $ and a lot of disappointment.
