Have you ever seen a movie made entirely from long shots? Not? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one in "Spring in my hometown" and I have to confess, now I know why people do not do that. Technique is "art" to be sure, but it is certainly not ripe for public consumption. The technique is wrong wrong simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and maybe it could be the intent of the entire director. I do not know, I can not read my mind and I certainly do not know enough about the director to make a judgment. But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is ridiculous anti-American feelings. As an American, I am very aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very conscious of the fact that we are not always angels, but I will be damned if I take that guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind madman, Americans were not only at the root of the war, but I was the CAUSE of the war and almost destroyed the country alone. Anything, Director. And suppose you're gonna make this movie in KOREA COMMUNIST if we had not intervened, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost similar to making the Nazis "good boys" as they turn allied forces into "bad boys." This movie is so naive historically and so inaccurate in fact it's almost embarrassing to look. For a man who comes from a country that owes his EXACT to US interference, he moves away from the tall and powerful and judgment.
