Before watching this movie, I had very low expectations and I just went to see the cars. Finally, I even regretted leaving for this reason. The plot is almost non-existent. Character development is non-existent. So many cliques and much joy-dropping joy existed in the film I could only look at and wonder how it was even released. If not for exotics, I would not even have rated this movie at 1. An attempt at a coherent story line is being destroyed by the pure absurdity of this elite racing cult and the ridiculous characters that make up its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple that an average child could predict most of the story. Bad action, evil plot, bad jokes, bad movie. You do not see him. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and you will be tired of your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad taste.
