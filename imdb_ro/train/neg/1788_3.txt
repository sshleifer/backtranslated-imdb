By giving credit if it is due, only technically colored, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention. This is undoubtedly the lowest point in Bing CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is just as unclear as you can imagine, and neither the casual Bing, neither William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely stupid in a boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a role as a heroine stocking suit who asks her to look adorable at Bing and something other than warbling a pair of unbalanced ballads in a voice probably called for the occasion. Mark Twain's notion is not evident in any scenario. Only Crosby fans dead can appreciate this misery of a given film in the uninspired direction. Even the extras look like they do not know what they should do. <br /> <br /> Summing up: Sweat as drinking water. Not recommended, even for children.
