There is no way to describe how real, indeed, this film is really bad. It's a shame that I actually stood in this movie, this very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong with her? By acting: There is no performance that is just a short distance from being sub-par (atleast they are very beautiful). Soundtrack (melodies): "If we get Orgy on the soundtrack, then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film!"; Soundtrack (Score): Okay, but whoever has a keyboard can make a good soundtrack these days. You do not even ask me "What the hell?" moments, here are some: The killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens the actress returns, no one is there, turns back, there is something standing in front of her; From the moment the Killer appears with a power drill, a very big one! Those who create movies get points for at least connecting, but I can think the killer took the time to find the power plug to connect it. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I mean "Where did you get the drilling?" I could go on and how bad this movie is, but I only have 1000 words. I'll give 2 out of ten stars. A star to make me laugh and another star for all the split. Seriously, do not waste time with this.
