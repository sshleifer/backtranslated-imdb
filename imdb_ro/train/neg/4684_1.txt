This movie is an insult to all submarines. It was bad. It seems to have been written by monkeys. The act was absurd. If this is the opinion most Navy people have, then we cry for our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it under "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" as the underwater movies go. Gene Hackman must have really needed rent to do that. Denzel Washington must have been picked up. Few in the plot makes sense. And the end. For a rebel to be rewarded for his murder? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you have not figured it yet, I did not like it. And if it was not for all the pro, I would not have bothered to post.
