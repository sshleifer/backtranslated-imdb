This movie is published as an intelligent romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic, and it's certainly not an effective comedy. The adventures of the well-understood, but pathetic character, "Tom," oscillate from an extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only rescue harvesters are the competent performances of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see Paltrow's pleasant face. In general, to be avoided!
