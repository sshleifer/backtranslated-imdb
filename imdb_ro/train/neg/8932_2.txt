I have to say that I was very curious to see this movie and it was considered a notorious disaster when it was released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It also appeared on several critical lists of bad films, an interest, I had to see what made this movie so bad. After seeing him, I think I have my answers. Though I say it makes for a curious viewing, the act, the direction and the script are so sorry that the alleged satire is completely lacking. Racquel Welch appears to be trying to transmit the movie, but after the sex-change-opening sequence, the movie goes so far down that it can not cope with this task alone. John Huston, like uncle Buck Loner, has no help, as he licks himself and leers on the screen, sometimes he shows he marvels what he's doing there. Rex Reed echoes around Myron, Myra's alter ego and even has its own masturbation scene celebrated. Bravo for debut performance! Farrah Fawcett plays a bad blonde; she seemed convincing in this role. But, of course, certainly the most notorious role was in West Mae. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face that made sexual inconvenience seemed more suitable for a horror movie. I do not want to personally put this; but in this movie no one is doing well. Direction seems so unclear and non-existent that the film is not only bad but also boring. Cast in old movies of old movies and the movie gets even more disconnected. For each of them to anyone who enjoyed it, and I was glad to have seen her at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that has always been reputed to be from the beginning.
