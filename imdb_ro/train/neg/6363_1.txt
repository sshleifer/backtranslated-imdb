I have not seen anyone split this movie yet, and I think I can be the first one. It was terrible. Actually, I did not look at the end. It was like watching a boring soap or a very good soap (all the soaps are shit). The actors were poor, and the story was bad. The person who rated 10/10 has no idea what this is about. The scenario was terrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation involving threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and beat him out, but not. He says, "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look away. Please do not watch this movie because ... It's CRAP! <br /> <br /> Summary: Poor, bad battles, bad scenario. Do not forget! Of course, this is in my opinion.
