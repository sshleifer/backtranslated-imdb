Wow! Just a movie this terrible thing could inspire similar Showgirls. I mean where to start? The song is indecently feared? Do Zadora's non-expressions throughout the movie? The fact that, despite having been in Los Angeles, aka "land of casting sofa," every single man (and a woman!) Walked everywhere during sleep with Pia Zadora by any means necessary? Or about the fact that every person in the film is not perfect at all because they are either stupid (Pia) or a desperate person (all others)? And given that this movie was written by screenwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of comprehension of the movie industry (which Hell would admire and kiss to a SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br /> But is (funny) funny though hell. The "breakdown" scene will make you giggle and after you've seen the climate "I'm not the only one who had to" the awards "(all are done at the usual negotiation-basement level we expect from such quality actors as Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia declined this discourse when he won the Golden Globe, make me a day, however, if you are a fan of the bad camp, let him go to a sticky film.
