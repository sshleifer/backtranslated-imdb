I agree with the previous comment, what disappointment. He dropped the idea that it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier are in it. I was surprised by their performance, expected more than when they were good actors. I thought it was a slow start but it got worse. I even laughed at some bad stunts! when it is supposed to be a mysterious movie. You can even guess who the killer is in advance! <br /> <br /> For what really happened? <br /> <br /> We are sorry to say, but you do not even bother to lose time and money. <br /> <br /> Plictisitor !!!
