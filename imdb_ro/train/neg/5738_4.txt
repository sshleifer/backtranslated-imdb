"Darkness" was fun to some extent, but it did not seem to have a plot, missing one more than other films accused of this disadvantage; that is, "bad taste". It started very well, with a man running away from something. It was very creepy for these first few minutes, but after a while the movie became fun at the gore level, which was hard to find at some points due to poor lighting and poor recording quality anyway. The film was hard to believe because of the juvenile act, which most often seemed to be talking to friends with a video camera, making lines while they were walking. This, with the absence of any plot, made it seem like the movie started without, and ended without, a scenario of any kind. As I said earlier, gore was the only drawing point of this film, which has often been hard to find.
