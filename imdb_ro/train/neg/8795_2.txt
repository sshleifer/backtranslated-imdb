I have not really seen any redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I've seen was apparently obsessed with Quentin Tarantino for that ... There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe decent. However, in general, I found this surreal and ridiculous film. The hand film has been linked to the slow movement and other cinematic tricks, I found clumsy and dizzy, even bad. Overall, the music along was horrible and repetitive at the extreme, as well as reminding me of the US Army's psychological war against the various malcontents. The various veins that made up the film are incidental in their placement and unrealized and unresolved in their content and "conclusions". A depressing film (not a true movie, a term reserved for true art) left me feeling bad. Do not you think that the different people who try to rotate it as a "romantic comedy", although there are isolated elements of both films, repudiates in content, form and conclusion any association with this kind. <br /> <br /> suggest to stay away, despite the apparently positive ratings of IMDb and other rating sources.
