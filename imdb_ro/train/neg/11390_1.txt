This is not a movie. It is a collection of unassigned, poorly designed and poorly assembled scenes that show the unauthorized results of a 10 year old room with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that a highly abrasive girl on the train's corridor - the one with her hair, trembling, ipod and nervous tick - probably shot her in a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you have done more than the ten minutes I have done, do not bother to try to match what you have seen in the context of the European artistic mentality that I praised above. This is a true and complete loss of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine. The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what is now going on for much of humanity. What's next? Six directors who interact socially with the Wal-Mart snack counter?
