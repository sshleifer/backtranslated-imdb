I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane," all of whom are in this story! Add to the Gary Cooper mix as the main actor, and he sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I woke up at my watch for only 40 minutes, bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison did not look or behave like a Buffalo Bill. Cooper was far from being the best, sounding too woody. That was a few years before he hit his actor. <br /> <br /> In a word, his western shots are empty. You start crossing and watching another because most were much better than that.
