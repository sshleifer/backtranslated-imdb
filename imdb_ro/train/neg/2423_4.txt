I received this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about it. It had 7.8 in IMDb (9 votes) and some external reviews were nice. But I have to say it is a very ordinary and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinema, the movie is well-directed but never scared me. It starts well, but although I'm not bored at all, the story is so common and the things that appear so normal I did not like it very much. You can do some laughs. And you can see some tiny boobs. But if you like the giallos genre I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsense, astonishing, atmospheric, brutal of crimes ...), you will not appreciate this movie much. I give him 4 good directories and editing, as well as the final twists, making the movie fun. But it could be a lot better.
