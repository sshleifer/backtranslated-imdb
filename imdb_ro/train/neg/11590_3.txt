It gets worse, the series is in a serious fall. The first two sequels were acceptable and since then I've seen a bunch of really terrible movies. Robert Englund gives another extraordinary performance like Freddy, but the rest of the song can not work. The story is that Alice, after surviving the previous tranche of the Nightmare series, finds Freddy Krueger's dead dreams that start again. This time the stabbing killer breaks the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but maybe Alice can free her spirit in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, lose the next three, then watch the last one.
