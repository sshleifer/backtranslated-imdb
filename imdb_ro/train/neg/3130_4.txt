I entered this movie really wanting to smooth it. I thought the premise had plenty of potential and was ripe for an exciting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I did not expect Citizen Kane, we take this for the B movie that is. That being said, however, the expectations did not succeed. The historical aspect of the story is glazed and the end left me a little cold. The act in the movie was very wooden. In everything I give him 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have gained much more, with a little more attention to the grounding of the film. Is it worth seeing? I did not want the two hours back, but I do not know I recommend it to others.
