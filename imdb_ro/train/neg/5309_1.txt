I saw the movie one night late on the cable and I did not realize how bad it was. I usually enjoy inappropriate movies, but it was so revolting that it was not even fun. Among the most important moments of this film are absurd music that is constantly playing throughout the film, hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun that turns green neon and quickly disintegrates) and disgusting action. The act, in fact, is what I feel the show is stealing. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film and I hope I never have to see any of them. In general, we recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can not imagine a video store that carries this garbage) just so you can learn to appreciate good quality movies after seeing this garbage.
