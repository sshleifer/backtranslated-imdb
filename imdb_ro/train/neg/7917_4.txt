"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad policeman (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad mood, who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cayons in fast-drying concrete. While we wait for the cement to dry out and the film to figure out what it is about, we are periodically overturned in time without rhyme or reason to be able to follow the events that lead to the cement issue. A boring, boring junk, "Cement" suffers from the lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and the most ubiquitous flaw in the film; no cause for concern. A killer of time for the best potato potato needs. (D +)
