This film features a clip of mutilation of the live animal of an animal that was hacked by a machete and made her skin. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I'm watching movies on the basis that Im really does not happen on the screen. These clips of live animals are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people who belong to certain organizations to help horrible things people make other species. This should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate on getting this movie on the market! This movie should be removed from the audience. The person who made this film needs psychological help.
