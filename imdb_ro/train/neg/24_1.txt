I have to congratulate the genius who approved it. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as you think you are a partner, you can not grab every piece of low-cost cracked retail, the only intention you have to be to earn some money. it's bad, and I mean bad. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. As an actor, let's just say: do not go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a diploma or at least have a damn experience! The director. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life as a director you just suck. Your director is weak, angles are tangled (not in a good way), the lines seem to be read from hygienic paper and miserable music ... always comes when you should not and there is no apparent reason. And do not go to the writer by the way. Making movies is not like serving in a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things that I really doubt you will ever have. Instead of doing a bad movie, you must have shot this turn to oblivion and wait "until something good comes in. Or just go find a job in a coffeshop. You will have less stress and you will save someone in the movie some money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> vote: 1/10 (my first)
