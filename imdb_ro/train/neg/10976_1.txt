A terrible movie, which should be an independent one. He needed some addiction to something. This completely miserable film deals with the interactions between the Irish people. They tried to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this film collapsed entirely. There are too many things happening here, culminating in a small, moving clown and throwing rocks in buses and cars that obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is too busy to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years while a younger sister is pulled by a suitor. This makes the former sister become a bitter vetch and walk in clothes that do not deserve to believe. The older sister also gets agitated, but soon finds a love. Then we have 3 losers buying masks to rob a bank. Obviously, robbery does not work, but does not seem to be a punishment for offenders. Perhaps the punishment should have been for the writers because it did not create a cohesive film.
