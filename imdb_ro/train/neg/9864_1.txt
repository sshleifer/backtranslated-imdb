As a player, I can not say I like this movie. The truth is, I hated well, I hate that. I tried to look at her as openly as possible, but when it comes to her, she feels rather insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> I met a lot of players, of all different life categories. I do not know anyone to behave like any of the characters in the movie. It's as if the filmmakers took the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most players are more social, some with a more active life. <br /> <br /> 2. Style does not work. The mockumentary style is inappropriate for the subject of the film. A real documentary about gamers would work better. While it's good (clean IE put together), it's not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. The players swear I will admit this, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. Humor is missing. While self-depressing humor is a support of my group and other groups I have met, it is less self-deprecation and more than the humor of the toilet. Also, much of the game's humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not humor to the toilet. Most players would beat and throw someone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is essentially: Accuracy. I do not want to say rules but dynamic. Invariably, this film will be compared to lower-budget films, The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both representing real-world players playing real-world games. The difference is, Gamers: The movie presents a situation where you want to defeat the meaningless players of The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Huh, I know a guy like this ... Yeah, that's definitely Gary."
