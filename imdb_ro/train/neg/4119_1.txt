Thank God I did not go to the cinema for this movie. I'm sorry for the money I gave. I saw her on TV and I could not think of my eyes. I wonder if a movie could be worse than it. have spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. a terrible scenario of action and awful. I think the other people who wrote the comments are the man who works from that film company;) is a very big fiasco! in the year 2000 can I still laugh at this type of film? embarrassing ...
