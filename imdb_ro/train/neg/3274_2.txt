Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the TV series is transformed into a long-lasting movie and is ruined for all hundreds of viewers. Practically, Duke's cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County spend a very fast time in The General Lee. But he has to act together and stop the destruction of his family farm, along with almost the entire city, by Jefferson Davis "Boss" Hogg (Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds) to make room for a huge coal mine. They received help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Ricky Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while they are being watched by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane and the police. He also plays Joe Don Baker as governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of some impressive car stunts and, of course, Simpson's gorgeous body (I admit that the legs are not even Catherine Bach, but still!) But besides, it's pretty boring. He was nominated for Razzies for the Worst Picture, the worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst remake or sequel, the worst screen for Simpson & her "Daisy Dukes" and the worst scenario. Pretty poor!
