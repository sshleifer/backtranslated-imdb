Clich√©'s story about an imminent divorce - or not? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red heron zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no rewards, either emotionally or dramatically. Does not anyone teach writing more creatively? The true sign of a poor storyteller - when you can not create any kind of satisfactory denouement - just ends the story. I have to ask, "What made you think it's a story that's worth saying first?" <br /> <br /> Well, but lost, the debut of the child's actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgetful. And he wonders why nobody is looking at indie films! Now, ninety minutes of my life I will never come back.
