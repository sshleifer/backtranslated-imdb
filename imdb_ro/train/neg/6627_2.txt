What happens to RGV? It seems to be repeated in every movie. Eliminate creative ideas? If he has time, take a seat in the back. I went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course, I never imagined that it would be anywhere near the original. I knew it was not, the promotions said it all. But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treatment, after not being the same guy who directed Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have doubts when I saw Aag. I'm not going to talk about plot or story because most are taken from the original, if you even die to see this, you could play a fun game with friends: identify scenes from the original one and give your own ratings! So, Veeru gets Heero (how is that?), I suppose Heeru does not sound that good. Ajay Devgan is a disaster like Heero, the comedy is tense, and the unpleasant words that were actually in the company sounds fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more charming NICE tries to be more irritating it gets. It reaches a peak to the end. Rage is not really bad compared to the others, it's a guy to look for in the future. I was very disappointed by Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl covered with a shawl, instead of inspiring the fear that he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really came out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write more.
