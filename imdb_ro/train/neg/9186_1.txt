Do you know the sense of hilarity that you get when you watch a movie that tries so hard to be a serious cinematic play that causes credibility and miserable failure? When can not you laugh at the terrible nature of the garbage that cuts your screen? "The House of the Dead" strives to reach even this low level of cinema. From the beginning to the end, the "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling as if you just woke up to find out that the cat put the clean thing on his forehead as you sleep. It is clear from the outset that female actors have been cast for their size of cleavage (which they exploit shamelessly), while men for their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude. Frankly, I did not care about any character for any moment of the movie and I woke up wishing to resign her to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll would have had to consider examining two hours of filming in real-world movie play. At least then will we have a better adventure? However, not all the blame can be put on the actors, as it is certainly a challenge to produce a compelling film when faced with the scenario of this film. It's probably the worst section of the movie and actually contains such lines: "These are zombies, simply" and "No head, we do not have to go there! It's bad!" We all know that zombie movies will never be specially thought provoking or meaningful; at best, there are two hours of action, blood and horror. Trash, yes, but fun. It's not the kind of garbage that breaks out of your bin bag when you pull it over the room and blow your shoes in the sour milk boxes and the fall of the bananas. According to IMDb, "The House of the Dead" has received such bad reviews that no Danish cinema has bought the movie. If we could have the same privilege. Final Score: 1/10.
