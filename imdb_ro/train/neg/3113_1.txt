This movie is a mess. I'm surprised she even has a theatrical release. Robin Williams would have gone straight to the movie. It is insufficiently written. It's low. The more serious offense is that it took an interesting subject and reduced it to a ridiculous thriller that does not have emotions and has no suspense and no internal or emotional logic. Especially after the first half an hour, the movie blends in a series of ridiculous pieces that are so high that the audience I've seen laughed at her. Save your money. The trailer is misleading - it's not suspensory and there are no emotions - in fact, the most serious crime of the film is that it's simply boring.
