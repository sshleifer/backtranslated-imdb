This movie is nice to look at, but it's like watching a very bad experimental theater. Plot (if one exists) makes no sense. But it is very "artistic". A lot of photos of actors dressed in the bottom and deep into the eyes of the other. Lots of artist photos through windows and people in the frame. Mumbai and stray people. Lingering close to faces and bodies. Until you reach the cat's roof trois, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. It is supposed to be a father and son relationship, but you just want the two to be just f * and each and end it. If you've always wanted to see Russian porn pigeons without money, your wish was granted.
