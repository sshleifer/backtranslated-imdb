- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean the city. Not everyone in the city is happy with what it does. When the sheriff orders a courtyard in the city, the owner of the local salon (and a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. The owner of the salon can not know that the sheriff and the killer will fall in love. Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with an inadequate execution. It's a good movie somewhere trying to get out. In a more capable or a larger budget, Gunslinger could have been a fun look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a ruthless mess of a movie. There are only so many things wrong with the film: a supportive, unsupportive distribution, stupid and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene with actors (and horses for that) will start, expecting Corman to shout "Action." The best is the scene of two riders on horseback, standing by a building. Suddenly, they take off and turn to the corner, as if traveling a few miles. Or take the example of people who can turn into the city. We see that a man enters a building and a second appears later in town to pick up his horse. - It's not like Corman did not have a few decent actors to work with. While none of them were big, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were able to turn into a good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they do not have much to do to work. - I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend you go on the MST3K route.
