Think, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make "officials." How the hell have they spent $ 45 million to make this musical video glorified? A virtually unknown cast, two or three sets, with no special effects to see ... I know it must have been spent on the scenario with elaborate, economical talent and tension. Pull, the set of bars must have cost a package. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead doing something for less. I'm just surprised he did not throw anything. Anyway, it was not a terrible movie I think. Female conduits seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was okay. IMO It is only a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $ 5 million without any loss of production and could have achieved another 6 worth of 5 million dollars.
