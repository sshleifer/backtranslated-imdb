It is kind of fascinating for me that so many commentators consider this masterpiece. I'm not boring in quality films and I will agree that, from a technical point of view, as well as for several portrayed characters, the film is in a class that deserves to be awarded. But there is no sense (for me) of this film that actually goes anywhere; I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. It's a series of mood scenes, maybe even remarkable, but I want more from a movie. I'm looking for a story, a movement, and an accomplishment of arrival, none of what I've found in this movie. Yes, it could be considered poetry on the film. . . but there is a great poetry that I can not live for the same reason: to paint pictures without going anywhere. One more thing to say is that it documents an English childhood in the middle of the century, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personalized by what a young British boy had to live at that time and in that place. After I grew up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I can not wonder if this contrast has had an effect on those who review the movie so favorably. In other words, may there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on the "movie magic" (which I recognize there) and completely ignores its lack of relevance to the nature of the actual experience?
