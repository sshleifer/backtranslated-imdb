I did not like Frosty coming back and that. Both films are absurd, with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been made, but Frosty's return was the worst because of the unalloyed snowman they had attracted. Frosty's winterwonder was great, and so was the dramatic drama. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty Snowman was just as classic of 60 and a fun line as when they talked about things that are not real and then Frosty walks through the humming window whistling what he does but everything something else was badly written and badly animated, and we just got the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library 2 or 3 years ago, and the art seemed impoverished, so I did not get it until this year, because the pictures on the back seemed a little excited, but I played this movie. He was a bad artist like the DVD and it was terrible what's going on. I saw this at night and I realized I was asleep on the whole thing (Always wait when I look at something during sleep) But this movie was boring in general Overall rating: Grade -C It is similar to another special evil, bad in the frozen returns and this one. This is the 4th sequel as the only 4 home and I thought the movie was OK, but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad house just 3 and 4 people hate it. My sister did not watch so much that when she walked into my room to watch two and a half minutes of her, she went like "I hate the animation!" I agree with her the same as the 3rd Frosty return. Very terrible!
