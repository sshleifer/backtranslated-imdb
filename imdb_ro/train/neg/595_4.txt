Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, it's all about this movie. No real plot, no story. There are no good, good characters, "characters" are not correct, since you have no clue about who they really are. I mean, they're being watched by strange things that look in the channels (who is this? Why is it there?) That's scary enough, but am I really interested? No. I do not know. Why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I want to live or die. It's dimensional and it's based on gore and sound effects that scare you, which they rarely do. This movie has no meaning, no purpose. It feels like I fell asleep and lost the 45 minutes of accumulation. Jump into action. Basically, some women and her friends are stuck in the underground of London, they are being watched by a weird creature, and eventually escaped her. Creep has the moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is great and the sounds are good, but that does not do what makes a decent horror movie, unfortunately everything that goes to waste. There is nothing new. Another modern, predictable "horror," in which Kate (the "main character") is constantly doing "stupidity," knows that you know you know you have to do sensitive things in this situation, but no. to do the opposite, because I am a blonde blonde thing. "I would like to not do this, it's done so many times, it's boring and it's predictable, in fact, I'm pretty upset, the bad woman was not stabbed by the wanted creature The Creeps Journey ends shortly in the movie. If you had a few beers, you took some pairs back to then, surely, follow them by all means, but if you want something original and intelligent, avoid it.
