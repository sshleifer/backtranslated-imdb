Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) directed and performed this strange movie, which is the second installment of a sort of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma '95 manifesto, though it really does. I'm not sure why I think about this movie. All the actors are good. They offer quite good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somewhat interesting. But I do not know, it's about the movie I do not like. Sexual scenes are too long. It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of nonsense, I do not know exactly where it is. Of course it's not a bad movie, but I will not suggest people seeing it or telling them not to look. Just do what you want. If you feel curious and you are open, try, you might want.
