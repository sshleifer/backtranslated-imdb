Maybe I miss something because I read more positive things about the Man who deceived himself than I read mistaken reviews - and I do not understand. I like the novels to have a little style with characters who talk, watch and behave like Humphrey Bogart in Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call. Take the lead actor, Lee J. Cobb. His stuffed, wrapped outside the bed is just as far from the noir archetype that will show you quietly and smoothly, as you will find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as fatal females as another example. This is one of the worst cases of miscasting that I have seen for a while. It is not convincing about the role. As for the plot, he is tired and has no real surprises or something new for the genre. We could predict the outcome of the Man who was cheated after about five minutes. And that final scene of cat and mouse tracing is common. Ten to fifteen minutes of anything that happened really ruined any pacing the movie would have had to go for it.
