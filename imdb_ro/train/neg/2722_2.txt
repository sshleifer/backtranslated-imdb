For the greatest thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is an incoherent film from France that offers so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about a bitter old boy, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes to Tahiti in search of a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea what the people in the movie are or what they do. Without a coherent story to boast about, the film is losing momentum, although I am perfectly willing to admit that there might be something that actually gives a profound message of this film. This muddled, melc-paced drama runs for two hours and five minutes - although I seriously doubt someone with any kind of life will still remain around the closing credits.
