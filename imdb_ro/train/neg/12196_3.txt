The actors did a really good job playing their roles - especially the mother. However, as the movie progressed, I found I was looking more for their action and not because I thought at least for people. And sometimes I felt irritated by the irresponsible and maneuverable approach of the parents shown again and again. The daughter is a 17-year old scandal, whose main ambition in life is the bed of famous people and becomes a nyphet dance (complete with a lot of "prey"). The son is a low self-esteem guy who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much he throws a film of late drug in the movie. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather than putting energy in their outdated relationship, they would rather look for new partners (though the wife does not say stupidly, because the man she "throws" is going to be gay - OOPS! ). I just felt that ALL characters had to grow, and they had a hard time caring for such devious little villains. I think the author's attempt was to show the banality and the total lack of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems to be disingenuous.
