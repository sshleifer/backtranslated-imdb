Do not bother trying to watch this terrible series of mini-games. It's a six-hour height, an incredible triangle of love among three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no warmth in this story, no real passion, no true story. It is dry, boring, drawn and uninspired as they come. Nor does it meet the expected level of technical competence. Take the six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
