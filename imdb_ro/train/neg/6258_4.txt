Writer-director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his own game about a just-seen, recently widowed man, learning over the past three weeks that he's HIV positive; he pursues a homosexual partner he ever has, takes him to an apartment and binds him, forcing a blood test on the guy and a promising bloody reward if the results turn positive. The intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it is playing. James Marsden's captive is cynically realistic and angry, but the artist's manners are disconcerting - it's like watching a version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with his more difficult role, but his personality - his transformation from the shy type to the kidnapped-to-the-edge is not convincing, nor the conversations the two men have. Marsden, the homosexual party boy, is not apathetic, of course - he feels momentarily the sympathy of Speedman's situation - but he does not react or behave as any homosexual man does in this situation. The film is not an exorbitant, but it is a fraud that is still affected by poor drafting, poorly designed flashbacks, low-budget and high-end production that damages the silly claim and the soap melody. * 1/2 from ****
