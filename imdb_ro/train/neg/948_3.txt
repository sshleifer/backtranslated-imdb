I've been trying to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That's 70s Show," I do not get away with some haircuts and occasional references to the disco that evoke the 1970s - the decade I grew up. Of the episodes we've seen, most of the plots and jokes could be set at any time. Remove the novelty (supposedly) established in the '70s, and the show is neither interesting nor funny. If you are looking for a show that most successfully represents the youth experience in America in the 70s, in my humble opinion you can not do better than "The Wonder Years".
