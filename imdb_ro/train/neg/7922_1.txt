In a distance, the Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. Indigenous people worship cats. But dog men are fighting these feline-loving people and have no choice but to go to Earth and break people for food. This is one of the stupidest ideas for a movie I've seen. Let Ted Mikels make a more incompetent film than the already low standard set in previous films. It's like enjoying playing in a Limbo celluloid game. How low can it go? The only ones missed in the screen are US viewers. Mister. Mikels and his little handlebar mustache are actually people who still buy this stupidity. My class: F Extras from DVD: Comment by Ted Mikels; The story behind the achievement (9 minutes and a half); 17 minutes, 15 seconds from the scenes behind the scenes; Ted Mikels's filmography; and "Witch Hunters Trailers", "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Team", "Ten Violent Women" (with nudity), "The Devil's Blood Organ" and "Corpse Grinders"
