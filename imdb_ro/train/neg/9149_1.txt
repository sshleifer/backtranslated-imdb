There is absolutely nothing in this movie to show even the smallest talent scraps. None of them ever tried to act before, even the excerpts in the cafe look like they were stuck on the spot. Nothing looks repeated. The quality of the movie is terrible. Most of the "action" takes place in narrow corridors or in flats, with the cameraman piled up as a later thought, spinning some cheap appliances back and forth between "actors" as they lay their lines. No proper tripod and microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even Manos tariffs are better than these, at least they have the right equipment. What plot is simply lost in production misery. Keep your home movies, preferably made by a 5-year-old kid trying to be part of the video feature on Dad's new camera phone. You'll be looking long to find a movie more than that.
