Fairly beautiful woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie offers another good performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare has been far superior, she still deserves to look into this film. The distribution is full of typical Melrose Place types, characteristic features and seductive curves that I have never seen before. Along with Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I've seen in the Delta Delta. The plague is centered around a group of arrogant people in California who initiates Debbie Rochon in the shit right now. They tell him they have a crime club and they have to kill someone to be accepted. Debbie just wants to be accepted by these bad people, so they quickly kill a person and now the group has to decide what to do with it after falling for joke. VIOLENCE: $ Debbie Rochon occasionally has the blood sprayed all over, and all crime scenes are made in front of you. Gore hounds will surely enjoy!) NUDITY: $$$$$ (Also, Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as well as many of the actress and actors who have not been nominated, and the party with the pool seems to be just an excuse to get everyone naked, both the man and the woman, the character is gone after the first five minutes.) STORY: $$ (It could have been a bigger vote because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a filler between nude scenes. B-Rate movies often use nudity, but this is excessively limited). ACTING: $ (The act is sub-standard to say at least.) Rochon is always on the net, easily the best B-rated actress in today's business, but her character in American Nightmare was superior. Danny Wolske does a good job of Debbie's lust, but the other actors have nothing to write.)
