*** SPOILER *** Do not read this if you are thinking about watching the movie, though it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is predictable that it does not matter if you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you are wondering if you want to see Coyote Ugly or not: no! It's not worth the ticket or VHS / DVD money. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick" can be said. The plot itself is just as superficial, as it may be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. Beautiful young woman from a small town has become a great success in New York. Some desperate attempts to give the film any depth fail, such as the father's "tragic" accident, "the difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (the director) tries to awaken the audience's pity and sadness has no chance of succeeding in this attempt because of bad scenarios and superficial acts. In particular, Piper Perabo fails to fully convince Jersey of singing to an audience. The only good thing (and quite funny) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who is the little hope of this film. I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now ... what happened to great movies such as "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That was a real thing about Bruckheimer. If you are looking for a superficial film with beautiful women just to have a relaxed evening, you should go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much fun, fun and self-ironic) instead of this shot. Two fingers down (3 out of 10).
