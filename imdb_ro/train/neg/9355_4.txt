Recently I was able to handle Marilyn Miller's films because they are not on TCM in the UK. I was very intrigued over the years because it was one of the 20-year superstars. . For some celebrities of this era, such as Jolson, some of the magic shines, but it's not for Miller. The dance seems strange and poorly choreographic, singing somewhat limited, and as an actress makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. this movie, as the audience got tired of musical, almost all the musical numbers were deleted. So, I was left with a comedy of that period with a very little real appeal. $ 500,000 has been paid for this! So, I have only two conclusions. Whether it was poorly served by the cinema, or had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to the latest than the first.
