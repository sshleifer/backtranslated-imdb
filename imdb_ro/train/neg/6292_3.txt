I wonder how much this film has to do with the 1984 Bachelor Party movie with Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official sequel? This movie is devoid of each department and obviously it is better not to watch it. For a comedy, this movie is not good enough or funny. They rely heavily on their character, stereotypical evaluations, rather then the movie actually has some good, original and funny moments. Of course there is also very little present story and the nude of the movie than the pages of the script. Just wait for things to start in the end. There is a main plot of plotting in it somewhere, but one is so terribly non-original and is executed so badly in the movie it feels more like it is non-existent. I think there is even a message and a moral story in it somewhere, but this is again so terribly non-original and stupid in the movie that just does not work. It's basically a typical comedy for adolescents, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, only without the main teenage characters, which makes the story even sadder and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any type of movie. I regret to ever see this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
