Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s adolescent in the turbulence film. It's not a horror movie or science fiction. The plot refers to a group of teenagers who are about to be removed from the "hot rod" club because they can not afford the rent. Once out, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only rescue of the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the She-Creature costume) turns out to be a monster filmed outside of Blaisdell's work.
