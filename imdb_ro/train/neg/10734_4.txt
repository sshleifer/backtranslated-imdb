I've still read a negative professional review of this movie. I think we lost something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and have fun with invented stories. This is the best part. After the three take their separate paths, the film is divided into three threads. This is the moment when boredom enters. Of course, the Felliniesque robe, who makes chewed bread dolls, is at first a curiosity that opens his eyes. Unfortunately, the director beat him dying, even by injecting a line of terrain full of wilderness that does not lead anywhere in private. Bottom line: a two-hour, thin plot. If you suffer from insomnia, you see it in bed and you will have a good night's sleep.
