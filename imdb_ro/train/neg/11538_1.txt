A really horrible movie that let me feel embarrassed to watch the forty minutes or not, I could stay. It does not blame the actors, but the writer / director, the producers, the financiers, etc. they need a very rigid discussion. Maybe it's deep. Is not. This rape and ultra-violent violence, unlike the one centered on Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say or add to the amount of human understanding. There are no straw dogs that I have seen comparatively. Rather it feels something Pete Walker could have turned his hand, but even saying that I'm probably a little wrong on Pete Walker. Revenge is a strong human desire, but the Bedroom Window has more to say about this and the emasculation of men than this painful effort. I do not think it is particularly misogynist, simply joyful in describing certain details - for example. It is neither challenging nor confronted, although I'm sure filmmakers think they are very "bold", very profoundly unpleasant. Is it as great as we can target? That's why those involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote there the Latin phrase that translates as "Oh Times", but the customs!) But the new spell check on IMDb would not let me post until I did not remove it, so I had to remove the square braces. SorteazÄƒ IMDb.) Where is the high suction? The noble impulse? When you look at the British film - the Ealing comedy of Ealing or the Boulting brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene about Fallen Idol, our man in Havana, or the sublime The Third Man (a movie that has much to say about evil than a thousand straight); Powell & Pressburger's work; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and men's emasculation, look at "The Offense," director Sidney Lumet, from an original piece by John Hopkins, check "Tunes of Glory" for something worthwhile. said. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is, unfortunately, a total waste of celluloid.
