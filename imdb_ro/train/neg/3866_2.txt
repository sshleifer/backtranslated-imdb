I thought this movie had absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on the wedding day for your cousin? I would be heart! It's classified as a comedy, but it did not seem funny at all. I thought he just found cheap laughs and took them. Normally, I love Julie Stiles, but this is an exception. Jason Lee plays in another shameful show, which once again demonstrates that class and decent morality are not relevant in today's society. She had a total lack of taste and despised movies like this. I understand that people will defend this film and its morality because it is "just a movie," but I still stand in front of my signal that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, because everyone has the right to their own opinion, and some parts of this movie are nice, just say that in real life people who behave like characters of this movie are shameful.
