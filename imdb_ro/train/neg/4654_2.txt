A female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. He has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what he orders or be turned into a sneaky blood. After some killing, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. What can I say about this movie? That his rhythm is too slow, has strange sound effects (never such a bite) and ambiance (the new jazz here comes) and that the lights do not seem to be included on the set. It looks like a horror film "auteur", all in the inner soul. The plot is completely stupid and as you can guess, it is the vampire woman who explains how to kill her even if she does not have to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic, and sticks do not work. It's not even a funny movie. Perhaps, with some friends and a lot of beers, can not have funny parts (to be honest, it's funny in 10-15 minutes near the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's a bad movie he's posing.
