The 1960s were a moment of change and awakening for most people. The social revolution and disturbances were commonplace as people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, war in Vietnam, sexual promiscuity and drug use were part of the daily fabric and daily news. This film has attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects in a fun movie and has largely succeeded. In this film two families are followed: a white one, a black one. In the first half of the film, the story follows each family on an equal basis through social and family battles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. Of course, there are several characters in this family, and story lines are mixed, but no equal attention is paid to the racial aspects of this century. Overall, the act is well done and historically the film is mixed with color and black and white pictures to give a documentary film. The film is a fictional work, but well-known historical figures are used to set the time line. I enjoyed the film, but the situations were predictable and the story was unilateral.
