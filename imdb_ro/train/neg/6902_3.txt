Despite rave reviews, this movie gathered in New Zealand, any hype surrounding the production is, unfortunately, undeserved. Apart from a cliché-only plot, the film is disappointed by some weak accusations, accents and general lack of tension. While you have the overall look of a large budget (for the NZ), you feel is definitely the small Kiwi town ... <br /> <br /> Did not anyone see the Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who chose will pick the similarities immediately ... I heard comments that scenes like the guys who played basketball etc were shot to have fun at the clichéd fun "the boys talking but it happens to be forced ... I think Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but his delivery always seems only vaguely self-conscious. <br /> <br /> who have doubts about the fact that the Samoans culture that lives in the NZ has been profound, we hope it is not permanently affected by American discourse, culture, and everything that will be used will safety mind at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Robbie Magasiva always looks good on the screen but is left down by the script .. Always rub me wrong when a "comedy "has scenes that are so obviously set up, you are left to feel that you have a bad luck at the dot points - you see that you want to be white boys ... I know someone who found this hilarious mound - anyway, that person has the brains of a tadpole, and would fight to say his name if it offered a million dollars .... This pretty much sums up the mentality of this movie, OK, but not wonderful, fun but not funny ... Wake up NZ - this is not a 5-star movie, despite all the alive (white middle class blame :-)) reviews .... My advice? if you watch it, you drink it first!
