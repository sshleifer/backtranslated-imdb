Wow ... OK. So, after reading the little prey here, I decided I had to see this movie for me. This movie is HORRIBLE. I have not looked. We strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you will be more scared / entertained. It is a low budget, with bad action. Who gives this movie 10 is completely incorrect and should be ignored. I am not at all connected to any of the other commentators. Simply, this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Very, very stupid MOVIE.
