Dr. K (David H Hickey) is trying to master a formula that puts an end to all diseases and disabilities, but needs living donors to complete their work. His brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted into the medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is pre-law and plans to attend the law school the following evening. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah calls up with her current boyfriend, who is torturing Walt's lady (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend, who recently paid his friend's deception job). Eddie gets accidentally hit by a car and appears on the trail of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard ... to "recover" Eddie using his illegal methods. When Dr. K is applying Eddie's serum, terrible events also occur. Eddie's face swells massive warts, while he also has a taste for human flesh. Many will die, so Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite that he can not extinguish. Soon he can even represent a threat to his father and his girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be stopped. Usually horrible horror film directed to video suffers from a severe lack of budget, acting and general talent. The premise, which seems to be an interesting fest-fest, fails to deliver even a zombie hit. The gore is limited to a few food scenes, but most of the violence occurs outside the room. Using time to move the story over time can become annoying.
