There are two reasons why I did not give a movie to this movie. One of the reasons is that some actors (such as Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) are working, who have tried to play at their usually good level. However, many scenes have somehow been blocked by the bad script. The other reason is the cool idea and the Cyborg look, which is quite different from most other such roles we have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is just as bad as it can be. Scenarios, unnecessary and boring dialogues, stupid script work. And it seemed that it was the first film for many actors. It could have been an interesting story though, but they failed completely.
