This must be the cheapest movie ever made in the 21st century. It's just low quality, but it finally drops below ... everything. All cheap tricks - such as flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects. All actors are below the average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne wonders: "Why do you look so careless?" The correct answer is that he can not act. No matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her boyfriend dies, she's fired), she's got the same grin in front of her. It's not just the movie, which is B - quality. It's also a description of the back cover (at least in Finland). In the text there are things like Lorica Gray -Vessel, Capital-Vessel and the main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like a different movie, both having characters called Fletcher and sea monsters
