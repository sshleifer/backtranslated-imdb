I saw this movie accidentally and this movie was an accident ... well it must have been. blonde women being watched, the villain then disappearing from place to place in the minute that disappears and reappears, hiding. He was not really a super hero, so I do not know how he did it. cat and this is not hard to do. the old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer frightening, in fact, it was no longer scary years ago. you had the policeman on the path of the villain, another clich√© (played by the Irish idris with a very convincing American accent, is from London), the director had no clue and made a movie full of frightening moves "which was a scary comedy Pitiful!
