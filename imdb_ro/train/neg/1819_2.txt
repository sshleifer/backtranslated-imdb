I've been looking for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He's one of the worst directors of all time - right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and horror panther. However, I was disappointed that although the movie was really bad, it never approached the horrific levels of some of its previous schlocky films. For this reason, this movie was not particularly fun to watch for bad movie fans. Now I was careful to watch this movie because the title "Navale stewardeses" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie - something I would not review on IMDb. However, this movie seemed to be sometimes - especially the first 10 minutes. But you could say that the script has undergone many changes, because for most of the movie there is no suspicion and by the end of the movie there is a plot that does not come from where it is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result is total confusion. Unfortunately none of them is good. For example, as a pornographic film, it looks surprisingly little and it is incomprehensible why it would put a 71-year-old in some of the scenes of love. Sure, because Mr. Livingston, aged 71, seemed good enough - but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him with a young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, Livingston has become a Rambo guy! Talks about strange and inappropriate. In general, this sad movie is a little recommended. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to take care and the movie manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title as Naughty Stewardesses.
