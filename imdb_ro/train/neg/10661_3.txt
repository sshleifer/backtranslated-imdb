It's "The F.B.I." with Reed Hadley, with a cast guest! The movie begins with an accidental (convenient?), Which leads to one thing, and another - which does not really indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, USA". prison break. The story is very unlikely to say at least. It's like a TV show, just more "violent" (for the times). BAR - the cast is a trip! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his colleagues are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (read a "Muscle" magazine) and William Talman (read a "Detective" magazine!). Sincere! You should know this, an early scene reveals what happens to a "missing" boy, answering the end of the "voiceover". If you do not want to hang this up, do not miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the boy (Peter Votrian, who behaves well as an asthmatic fugitive). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, United States of America (1955) Howard W.
