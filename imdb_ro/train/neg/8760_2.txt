This film refers to the alleged non-establishment (aesthetic and sexual) that apparently can not resist the basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a younger screenplay that relies almost entirely on smart dialogue; which is not. Nixon's role possesses the best lines, but often shelters too fast, a malfunction that must be directed at the director. The grotesque climate uses every available clich√©, whether spent or not, and duly completes this great comedy test.
