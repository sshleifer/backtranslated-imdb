Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients of being a policeman that is his life-long dream. But his luck changes when he has a car passion (a very bad one) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he begins to behave wildly unconsciously and becomes the best cop ever to be. Over time, he realizes changes, and his animal instinct begins to take over his human side. Meanwhile, he finds a beautiful girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to be controlled and behaved civilized. I'm not a great fun of Rob Schneider. Actually, this is his first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best man to play in the loser (see his part in Ally McBeal, quite funny in fact). There are some good parts in the movie, such as flirting with goats. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the spectator feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is good to watch as long as it's not taken too seriously. But very sad to see such movies do very well in the box office. The animal is not the worst movie I've seen so far, but it does not manage to get more than *.
