Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it somehow? After reading the book that this movie is supposed to be based on a few years ago, I can say that there is little if something in the original book. I went to this movie with low expectations - I knew she would have a telemovie feel sick to it - but it really did not manage to meet those <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel. - the only relationship with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character that was given the same name. They just spit in front of the fans of each Carlito Way; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other film will be made by addressing the original, untouched material of Carlito's Way - something I really would have liked I'm seeing. I felt the same about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography from the most feared underworld of Australia, instead they made a film ho -hum a dementia but strange (though Eric Bana's performance was on the scene). Now we will never get to see Carlito's initial ascension and fall. The three stars are due to the fact that watching it simply as a stand-alone movie is not so frightening - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but he could be good in other roles), and the story is not too bad. Even Puffy Combs suits his role. But they misunderstood the nature of the underworld nature at the time (I'm a little bit of crime and crazy fiction) - something the original movie and the books were right to (after being written by that lawyer and now judged by Edwin Torres). The fact is, however, that it is not a stand alone - it is probably the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
