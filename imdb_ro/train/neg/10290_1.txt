I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay some time ago. I watched the songs and I thought it was too bad to review again. The excessive amount of aqueous "blood" from the beginning is simply overcome - not to mention the whistling wind sounds. My friends and I made a low-budget movie, and the effects went beyond this fest. With regard to the amount of mistakes in this movie, there are too many to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, was my teacher THEATER. HA! Ultimate verdict: Do not bother with this "horror". <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of a possible 73)
