absolutely garbage. I liked Halloween and since then, Johnny was in a downward spiral. it's about pits. we have John. pro-lighters are frightening! you do not have to make a bad movie that fucks me to tell me. Pacing is far from here. It feels like John does not have much to do here. to realize he did not write this junk. There are countless moments when the camera just stays and expects the actors to look bad or say something stupid. I like cutting long. too carpenter carpenter does not know how to use it. he must stay with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago. Please, John, do not bother me or bother me!
