Russian film "4" follows the life of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. One is a musician, a frozen meat seller and a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4," gathers me, is meant to show the righteousness and hope of life in post-Soviet Russia to make stories to make their lives look more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit all the way through it. There seems to be a suggestion going through the film that the shadowy Russian government has some shady things behind the scenes - the exploitation of secret cloning facilities, the sale of frozen meat ten years old, etc. - But the movie is so unformed and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone can figure out what someone really is doing right here. Despite the decent act and some incisive scenarios, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
