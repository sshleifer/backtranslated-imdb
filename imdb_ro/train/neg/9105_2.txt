What can I say about 2 crude intentions? Well, I can say with all sincerity that I'm going to watch this movie again if I'm stuck in a chair and my eyes are orange-colored. Robin Dunne's "Star" movie (No, I've never heard of him), whose terrible impression of Ryan Phillipe has made me wander all the way. In a terrible casting case, Dunne tries (and fails) to meet a handsome, charismatic handset. Because the actor is not beautiful, charismatic or charming, character is left entirely unbelievable. Amy Adams (she was in a buzzing episode) tries to take her place where Sarah Michelle Gellar left and brought to life Katherine's life ... However, Adams is not such a good actress, devoid of any real emotion, she often showed she was reading tact books just outside the room. There were two good actors in the film, but Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington in Austion Powers) performed very well and fun like Sebastian and Katherine's parents and are the only reason I've rated the movie as a 2, not one. The film itself is a bad version of the original, with minimal carbon copies of the imminent dialogue and scenes that did not have the originality of the previous movie. <br /> <br /> I think, as a TV show, it would have worked, but if it was recovered with people who could act in the main parts.
