<br /> <br /> Once we have ignored some of the inconvenience, it was actually a pretty decent monster / monster movement. So I will give some of the good points: - The dragon was quite convincing, especially when he ran through the tunnels in search of a lunch (clue: he likes people). - the action was quite uninterrupted and, after a weak start, I was quite absorbed in the story. - I'm sorry to say, I was kind of rooting for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. Now, for things unclear ** maybe some spoilers **: - if you hunted a dragon that breathed the fire in 1100 AD, would you load in the cave with a gunpowder gun under your arm? Spirit. - a female character with a name all over America, blond hair and an obvious Slavic accent, trying to claim she is Spanish? It is not like that? - a lead scientist whose ghost accent can be cut with a knife and supposedly born in Chicago, educated in the US? - a military helicopter pilot who carries out his own repairs, flies with a huge transport copter with no other crew, and is a combat expert and a boot soldier? O.K. Uh huh. I do not even remember that he gave 3 different ring signals in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. It's still better than some of the Japanese monster moves of the 1960s, but not so much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although, naturally, the end has left this possibility largely open. Or maybe they'll rent a real director next time. Despite everything I did, he gave me 4 out of 10. I added 2 more if I manage to compile and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
