Some movies are so bad they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was as true as the story of Pinocchio's chances of becoming a true boy. The act was terrible, the direction was poor, and it was traveling too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to overcome it and do it and go home. Neither Melissa Joan Hart has ever hit me like a talented actress, but then every movie she's made is pretty low, budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets the characters push them too much, speaking too fast, as if her hurrying words make her more dramatic. She really highlights the fact that there is a crew in front of her and she speaks with a camera when she should engage the spectator in her character. He's left pretty much all over the movie, and any foot he should have let him sit on, is ruined. Probably the only good thing about the movie is when she was finally caught. But even that was not satisfactory enough to subdue my hope for such a bad movie. Take care if your taste in the film is softer than a piece of toast.
