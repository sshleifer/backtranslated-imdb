This movie was a piece of confusing garbage. You never knew what was happening. The characters were badly written and, for the most part, were totally disappointing, with the exception of Gus (skillfully played by George Eads). I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, The Curse of Dracula) should have won a prize for the academy. It was really sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and sticky film. Life time has sunk to a whole new level. Someone has to make sure that this director does not work again in the movies. It also had to be a horror film because it was much more fun than scary. To Shame Life, To Shame.
