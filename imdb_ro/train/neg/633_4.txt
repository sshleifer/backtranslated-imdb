Good land is the life of a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on Pearl S. Buck's novel. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to throw Anglos in the main roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as the farmer's father. It has such a hard American accent as most of the main actors that I could not bear listening to. It is a shame that Hollywood has failed to overcome its racist beliefs to impress the Asians into the main roles. To take Anglos and make them show that the Chinese are close to Anglos putting shoes on their faces to play African-Americans.
