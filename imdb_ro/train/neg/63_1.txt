Crack. This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. All the shows are good, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns are talking about this and that's your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall's character is senile and continues to ask the same people the same questions. This brings him the same answer repeatedly. I'm pretty sure this movie has reached up to six, because people think she should like it. Good performances with famous and well-known actors, but the real complete work is a steamy flock. Well, maybe it's a little misleading, because the steam rising from a fresh bunch sounds a little like something happens in this movie NEVER FACE! Bag
