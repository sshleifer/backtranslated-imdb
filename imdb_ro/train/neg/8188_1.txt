The ridiculous thing about this ridiculous film is that if someone becomes a saint, he or she and his family and other significant people live forever. Let's forget that, in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and the saints do not have any other significant ones. That, for a millennium, Nick was Jolly Elf at Fred's Scrooge is never suggested! Open Nick to learn how to make toys, then Fred learning how to lead numbers; Nick gives a sick child a doll, Fred refusing to dolly along with the family farm! After several such episodes, he turns to Fred, who opens his spleen today to the Anonymous Siblings, while his colleagues lose their heads in empathy. There, I've only written a more coherent story than this idiocy! This Santa, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss in Queen Harpies hip, a direct operation from Mega-Mall Hell, and responds to a Council (huh? , who just gave Easter Bunny a pink egg. Oh, and her right man is a ditzy blonde in a mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! But what really sent me across the edge was Slam being named # 1 on the Births List. Should not a picture list be reserved for future Hitler and Stalins? Children who are the true variants of evil? No, old guys, a good boy who sneaks up because it's undesirable and ruthless is Demon Seeds! The Nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
