This movie is horrible. Everything in him was done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand when the writers do not come with their own lands. A girl wishes her 13th anniversary and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds like a movie in the '80s called Big. What is even more annoying is the act of Jennifer Garner. She does not behave like she is 13 she behaves like she is silly. Since then, you can guess the whole plot. She has a good job, and it happens that a friend she's 13 years old is working with. Wow, how wonderful! But, no ... her girlfriend is bad and he's coming back to her trying to do her job. But, of course, she finally wins when she comes up with a "big" idea. There is also a dance scene in the movie I've seen a thousand times before. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
