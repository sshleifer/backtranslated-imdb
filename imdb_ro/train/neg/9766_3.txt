Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was the only one responsible for some of my favorite horror movies ever (such as Edgar Allen Poe's adaptations, Death Wheel Mask and Pit and Pendulum), as well as some inexpensive, inexpensive, fast-free fasts from The Great Haunted "and" The Gods in the Shark Reef ") Corman also made some movies that are simply unclassifiable and simply" almost impossible to judge properly. "The" trip ", for example, as well as the imagination called "Gas-sss" can somehow be labeled as psychedelic exploitation, in other words, they are incredibly strange hippie-influenced films. walks back and forth on the screen and where the hell is going all this stuff. The plot is simply and yet very efficient: a strange but deadly nervous gas is unleashed accidentally and annihilates the entire population of the world for over 25 years. This * could be the basic premise of an atmospheric, rocky and nail, post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman have decided to turn it into a trippy movie-drum. None of the characters attempt to even prevent their inevitable death; they just happen on the street and found a few juvenile crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s-s" is a boring disappointing and trying too hard to be bizarre. The whole script seems to be improvised on the spot and not at all funny. Definitely, it's not a cup of tea, but the movie has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who am I saying is not worth the time or the money?
