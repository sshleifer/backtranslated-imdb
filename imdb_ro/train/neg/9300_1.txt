Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (heartless). The lightning is terrible. Music is very bad (piano and orgu ... come!). The actor is ... there is no action! There is a guy who actually goes to the forest to look for his missing wife and take time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat clown that can not overcome a turtle! Each member of the casting is stupid and the director puts every moment of movie shooting in the film effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The end is the most stupid ever done. Think about it: The type (ken hebert) who has the ability to act is just like his writing (he is the brain behind this flop) to invite a co-worker and two of his friends in the cab for the weekend, kill them. On the morning of Monday, he returns to the office as if nothing happens. The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert is trying to make us believe he is a family business that continues for generations (his uncle is a clown killer) So, of course, NO cops will question him after his colleague disappears ... <br / > <br />
