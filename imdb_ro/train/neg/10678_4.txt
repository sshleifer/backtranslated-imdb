This film has shown good - a good distribution, an eternal subject and an explosive opening. He got out of there. Why was it filmed with the camera? It moves, sad, a part catches scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A poor choice. As if this was not enough, the most serious editing in memory involves a drugged spectator - mandatory if you want to enjoy it at all. And then she commits the worst sin of all. After driving the viewer to all sorts of improbable and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they give credits without revealing the denunciation - the end - the pay - how the hell the reason? How can you expect to succeed by doing endless thrillers? Doh! This movie had a great promise and ended by making a plant in the mud. What a loss of effort. The poor effort of the writer and the director.
