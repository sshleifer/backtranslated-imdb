This is an amateur video shot, not an "electrifying drama" as the DVD liner boasts a fake. I've seen much better things from film-studying students. Most of the story takes place with a taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could be made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was poured together later. Editing is extremely tough. The final edition was probably made with two chambers that create content back and forth instead of a correct editor. Maybe they did the taxi editing? English subtitles were written by someone who does not fluently speak English, for example, "Where are you going now?" To say that the quality of production is on a par with Blair Witch is generous. Unless you're still scared, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort with many cold and funky pictures across Jakarta.
