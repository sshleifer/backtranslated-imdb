"Meow's Cat" contains some scenes that boast of intelligent dialogue and some fine shows, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected at Chaplin (thanks in part to an excellent hair and makeup design by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing that novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins like Marion Davies (though why movies never use real life stutter is hard to explain). But these elements do not add to a whole success. The script seems to have worked a lot on certain scenes - meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well done - but not so hard on the overall picture. Several minor characters do not have to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic film is illogical (for example, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something that he does not really want to hear?), And party scenes are repetitive and tiring. I'd like to think that a trip to Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie shows. Davies is characterized as a typical bubble-type guy that is not really accurate, and the writer's ideas about Chaplin and love are unlikely. <br /> <br /> Odd, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected with the thirties in Paper Moon, does not have a similar affinity for the 1920s. He insisted that the excellent costume designer uses only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period (eg, "Yes, we do not have bananas"). When Hearst insists on everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems that the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> The life of silent film stars can make fascinating films, I'm sure, but not this time.
