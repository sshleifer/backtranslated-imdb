God's dreadful fear, terrible-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was being drugged. In a bad way ... The character that acts is the poorest thing I have seen for some time. This movie was more like Lord G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie seems to be on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when I am in the stroller and you can say there is no horse. They run from foreign monsters and go at the same speed as fast jogging. Then he goes to a long shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG, in general, seems to be sub-par 1992 beyond the eye of the mind. I mean, Come on, really. It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. The worst. Movie. Ever.
