A black guy is fighting ... and supposed to win ... yes ... 1/10. Obviously, fiction. <br /> <br /> So we are present with a beautiful damm title, a nice line of tags and even a nice plot of plot .. That's about it where it's over. We move into fiction after. Michael Jai White, the black guy so he does not get confused with the name .. portrays a black guy .. Umm, that's all there is to the name .. <br /> It's so hard to find decent help , you must have hired black friends to help bring down the budget, the low inefficiency of this movie, the shadow of the camera that trailed the first scenes .... Yes, obviously idiot moment for the average guy like you and me. but yes ... 10 lines. review sent,. if you paid to view this movie, you were screwed.
