"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who enter the body of Dracula. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to harvest the body and steal blood for the auction, it is an offer I can hardly refuse. Students are also constantly watched by a Vatican vampire killer! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a fun little horror film that has many flaws. The characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is quite average. there are some good gore effects, such as a really cold decapitating scene, but there is not enough violence for my movie. The film becomes quickly boring and forgetful and there is absolutely no suspension. So if you like the modern vampire, the atmospheric vampire cells from the 1960s and early 70s, such as "Blood Lips," "Dracula's Bridegroom" or "Lemora : Child's Supernatural Story "to name just a few of 4.
