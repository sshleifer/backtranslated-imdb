The progression of the plot is sufficient to "throw one in" and create curiosity about the outcome. Still, the feeling that remains is that the filmmakers have forgotten to put an end to it. If the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally made in the Twilight Zone), it was too negligent as a positive effort.
