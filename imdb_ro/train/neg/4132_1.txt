A characteristic feature of 21st century cinema that allows the shelter of various evil creatures and evil boys against each other. I have not seen such a thing since Godzilla v King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you brush up and in the fog of good things you have an inspired idea and see how you play before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you came to write it. Great ideas like all vampires are women. Ergo warm, deadly seducer, but in a way I want some kind of way to go. And all zombies are people. Well, that's what men are like a woman right after she's been thrown or deceived to the right? So everything would seem good if you did. Then the rot begins to settle. Mosters is struggling. Nothing is happening. Another fight. The philosophical capsule and the wind code. Eureka found how to win. Great fight again and end. It sounds great, is not it? Had it been an indie company, it would be great. But this is Hollywood's eyes on dollars: gloss instead of what fans want. Everything could be swallowed nicely.
