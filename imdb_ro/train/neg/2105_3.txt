Bela Lugosi crazy coward scientist who uses orchids to bribe brides to steal the essence of life for the elderly wife. The dick in this movie is hilarious !! A lot of madmen plus a lot of stuffing and no plot makes watching this movie a nightmare. I liked the way all the pieces fell together in a typical Hollywood way. The story does not become interesting, and you feel helpless as you look. <br /> <br /> Usually I would score light bumps like this small but the dwarf just added enough creepiness and entertainent to get more points for a couple.
