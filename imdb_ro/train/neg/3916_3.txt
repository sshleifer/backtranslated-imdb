We all know that a movie never does justice to the book, but this is exceptional. The important characters were cut, Blanca and Alba were essentially soaked in the same character, most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were removed. Clara's clarity was extremely low, making her look much less shallow than the one I know in the book. In the book, we learn more about her powers and the important effects she has had on many people, who in turn has been a key element in family life. In the movie, she was just a special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third, by the way, is the son and thus comes after Segundo the second) and his ties with that between Esteban and his nephew from Pancha Garc√≠a (not son, admit) is cut in half and its importance has been reduced. One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all about, but it is stripped: this is called the "House of Spirits." Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family should rotate around the "big house on the corner", a line that has so many times been in the novel. The house is fundamental to the story, but the film brings it unjustly to a simple background. If I had not read the book before, I would never have guessed that such a savage and small film would rely on such a rich and entertaining novel.
