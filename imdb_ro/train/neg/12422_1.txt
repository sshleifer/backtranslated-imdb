I hired this movie to see what could be a bloody and non-stop movie and received this extremely sentimental and super-cheap, low-cost drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou saves Reb de gooks, he is shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. Vietnam scenes are shot in the back yard, swear! Lou is now affected by the brain, and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money, and Reb goes to a killing snare to bring him back. There are no good scenes of fighting, the stripes are two centimeters away from a person. Personality of characters changes in seconds. One guy is stupid and the next scene is good. The actress is horrible, and music is a very sentimental sentimental melody, Frank Stallone, that would hurt you. I hated this movie.
