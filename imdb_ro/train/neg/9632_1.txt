I have a terrible shooting band "Boom!" And I want to see it in all the glory she has on the screen. So I voted "1" and I hope you will. Together, we can shoot this movie in cinematic sinkholes and we hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG BOND in launching "Boom!" in the extended version of his director. The film is one of my ugly favorites - you look at the people involved, the directors, the actors, the cameraman and you say, "Yeah, I guess you can fool some of the people for a long time." Producers considering DVD release "Boom!" you should note that wherever it was shown, there were crowds of soldiers in theaters, but it was not until now at Frostbite Falls.
