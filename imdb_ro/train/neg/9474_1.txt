In modern day life, Eastern Europe is tough and for young women, prostitution is one of the only career choices and a melancholy one. It attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, to pay more and more money for time with her until she eventually wants to buy it. She has two pimps with emotional attachments to which she differs and she is generally around the past like a piece of luggage without their feelings. However, we are in the "art-house modern cinema" territory, such conventions as narrative structure, enlightenment of the subject so that it can be seen, camera techniques added to rather than distract attention from action and a vaguely coherent plot, all can be abandoned. Much of the time I had no idea what was going to happen and I rarely cared about it. People started leaving screening almost before the last arrived and the last arrived I do not think I've ever seen so many people coming out Images are important to the director - Characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen, we get long-lasting photos, in particular, and a sexual scene takes place in the infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional film, sexual scenes were remarkably common; the missionary positions between the naked people in bed were abundant and there were no drugs or strangely related. But maybe these days are common unconventional. Generally, almost entirely without merit. <br /> <br />
