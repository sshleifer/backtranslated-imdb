The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in the vodevil, but made very few movies. As is the case for other performers in their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible piece of film for the field and Seeley is the biographical film about them, portrayed by other actors: Someone Loves Me ", with Betty Hutton, and with that great Ralph Meeker song and dance man. In their time of glory, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another act of husband and wife Vaudeville - - Jesse Block and Eva Sully - made almost as much star status makes an almost identical act, becoming effectively The "second team" Fields and Seeley. Outside the scene, however, there was a major difference in couples' life arrangements. Domains and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room-service charges for every meal they ate, and eventually in the money crisis. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending at a comfortable retirement. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this short Vitaphone are occupied by two leggings-bearing pianists. Apparently, these two men were of little value in their own name in the 1930s, though I never heard of them. Eventually, Fields and Seely are in a hurry and start playing. They both have plenty of stones and are quite attractive. I was angry that both performers continue to make moves as if they wanted to enter a dance, but they never do it until the third of the three songs she performs in this short. When they finally started hoofing, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two great performers doing their act of Vaude. Now that I have seen it, I understand why they have never become stars in film music. My rating for this: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stay with Block and Sully.
