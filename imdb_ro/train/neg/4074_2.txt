I'm expecting the same emotion as I spit on GRAVE, but I was disappointed just junk how can you even call this movie (like a mini porn). He hurt me when he was made to eat his own business. There is no line of story, all of them jumping from each crime. If you like to see a naked woman or even a male, then there are spots in the movie for and there is even a point of masturbation in the movie that makes a porn and not a movie at all. I saw some bad movies in my time, but this is number 1. I want to see him again. The actors bored me during the movie, because they probably needed money to make this film.
