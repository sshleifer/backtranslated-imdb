Do not look at this movie if you loved classics like Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach, Sorell BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER and BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE DISTILS OLD! First, this movie begins with Bo and Luke running monthly for Jesse. Bo and Luke would never do that in the real series! This film portrays unimaginable characters doing things that would never have happened in series. In series, Uncle Jesse was honest and respected by the law. In this film, he is a moon killer and smoking with the governor of Georgia. In addition, if this was an extension to the Duces of Hazzard! and the ladies from Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: HOW TO MAKE JESSE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE HAS BEEN HELD AGAINST DUKES FROM HAZZARD IN MOLDOVA IN HOLLYWOOD? AND WHEN BOSS HOGG LIVES WHEN HE HAS BEEN AGAINST THE MOVIE OF THE REUNION IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? MAGIC CONSIDERING WHEN THESE CHARACTERS WILL MEET LIFE, WHEN HAVE BEEN VERY SIN FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good film, he would have had to bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach, as they did in 1997 and 2000, and made a movie family friendly shows what was and is still compared to this disgusting, disgusting movie! If you want to watch good Dukes movies, buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy the DVD 2 set that includes the Dukes of Hazzard meeting in Hollywood movies! Both look at the original distribution and are friendly to the family! Do not waste your time with a movie that does not deserve the written CD!
