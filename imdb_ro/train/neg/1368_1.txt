One is the highest rating I could have given this movie, since zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pisces, a lot of actors who did a better job, written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a 12-year-old who smirks and chuckles at riddles, jokes and jokes. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from Everyone in the Family), who tells Marilu Henner's character to "spin in both ways" sexually, was a cheap humorous attempt indicating a general lace of the film. You want a good sense of humor? Rent the Animal House, American Pie (just one side), Old School or Office Space.
