Oh my. How can I make movies of such beauty, but I am so terribly sorry. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not shit like that. There is not even an idea about a decent story, characters with multiple layers or attraction. It's just a random sequence of worthless shame that joined to make a "movie." I suppose only children under the age of 3 can enjoy it, considering that the world is so absolutely dimensionless, and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be angry with it. But again, it is far too frightening for anyone under the age of six that there is probably no one who should watch this movie at all. Take my advice and stay away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better story, and though she may not be able to draw such beautiful pictures, her stories are much more worth listening to. And please, on behalf of those you believe, do not expose your children to this piece of ****. I'm gonna give him 2 out of 10, and that's only for graphics, because the character's story and development are so terrible that they deserve a negative rating. And if you decide to follow him anyway ... to remind you I warned you.
