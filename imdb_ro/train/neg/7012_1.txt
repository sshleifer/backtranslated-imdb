Me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a "Premiere Surprise" I bought it for a movie preview before opening here in Denmark. I stayed in the first hour or so and I left! The purpose of the film seemed to be simply to describe the era (and club 54), but it did so in the face of the character's development, which did not exist and whose plot was little. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! The music was good, though. So if you like to hear some good music and find a solution for the 70-year-old mood, I think it's good. But do not expect to get a credible plot of characters. <br /> <br />
