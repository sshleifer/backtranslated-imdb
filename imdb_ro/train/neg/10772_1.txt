The sad part of this is that these are 87 minutes I will never come back again. I knew it was terrible from the beginning, with the guy dressed as a crazy Indian head on the roof. (See if it could get away with it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is really in baseball right now, so we decided to rent him on a rainy day. Even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it, I had to get lost when I heard all the useless tongues. Bad, bad movie. It was a terrible spoil of Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I do not mind a predictable movie if it does well, but that was not absolute.
