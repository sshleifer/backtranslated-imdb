Trying to compare or to represent this "bloated" like any "Hitchcockian" is an attempt to mislead Hitchcock fans to lose $ 7 on this movie ... Poor Action Stories Poor Script. <br /> <br /> No real suspense, no chills. Expect all through the weakness of this movie for big gain or even any reward ... You're thinking, what the hell was that about. And please, enough, with the move to make "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct! ... I can not recommend this to anyone ... I have mentioned how weak the action is? Williams did a better job than Peter Pan and Mork. But they were much more innocent ...........
