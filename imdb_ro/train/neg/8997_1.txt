This is the worst movie I've ever paid to see and except "They saved Hitler's brain", the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and so I anticipated what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced because it had no restrictions that improvised TV shows have to deal with. <br /> <br /> Writers must have thought we were going to throw something rough, a flatulence joke, some cheap sex, and hey we have a risky party that shares the ridiculous comedy. The shows of the game are nothing more than an unimaginable inexpensive deal to make on. Let's make a stupid business deal. The school comedy, which involved only one girl and her boyfriend, was just a bad high school jerk. The announcement of the paralysis weapon was humorous for Street Seasame. LA subway platform was gentle humor, using bloodless taste. The French chef who walks around the blind saying constantly "there is no difference" with a French accent was, you give me the point. The only funny sketch involved Chevy Chase, which lasted for a full minute. This means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Yes, I read the comments about the whole country that was stoned in the 1970s and you will love this movie if you are great. Well, most of the country was not killed in the 1970s. If inertia writers were stoned, they should have been on sleeping sinus drugs. There were four other people in the theater besides me when I saw this movie. Of course, the word has not yet figured out how bad the movie was.
