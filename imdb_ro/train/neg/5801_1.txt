Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist investigating the inexplicable. He travels to this small town where a witch (Ita Ever) is said to be terrorizing the community. His car stops and escapes into a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon and kills her, and the city wonders who killed this woman ... who think she was the witch, but I'm not completely sure. Ivan is now being pursued by her spirit or something, and she must have faith or something to beat her. I really hate Christian movies. They are usually full of actors blades, stupid story and minimal effects. Not to mention that it is not just a Christian movie ... but also a foreign one. The actor for Ivan's voice made the film more comic than terror, because it's so tall and tangled. Do not waste too much, losing this movie.
