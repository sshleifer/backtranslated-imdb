The fact that I watched this whole movie says something about it ... or about me. It's not a good movie. Terrible in fact. But terrible in the way that she kept my attention in that perverse manner that is like watching a tragedy and not being able to look away. He would have made an extraordinary MST3K topic! Most of the things that make a horrible movie are enjoyable here: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, built plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You will be delighted with deadly sequences, poor victims with agape mouth and waaaaaaaaay too long to contemplate their imminent situation facing those who offered their scandal of their death. Your heart will be warmed up by the old clich√©s of the action scene, like when two women fight for a weapon and go out but SHO? They both look to themselves, then to the others, then to themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one eventually descends. You will sing (in Latin, of course) with street carols that turn into a dead choir that, for a moment, threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical. you think I'm doing this because as the movies get worse, they get better, then it could be a decent choice for you. It's not as fun as my favorite sci-fi favorite schlock, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than luke-warm movies such as Omen II or III. 4 out of 10.
