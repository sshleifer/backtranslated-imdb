Not that I was really surprised ... the movies are never as good as the books they came from. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because it's one of my favorite books, even though I knew it would probably suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they have turned away from the story of the book too much, and the movie version did not find how horrible this house was. The end was different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible because of a very bad surgery. The actor was, at best, unmarked. Perhaps if a theatrical version had been made so that it would not have stayed so long in Lifetime's "made for TV movie", it would be a better move. If you've seen this movie, I really encourage you to watch the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
