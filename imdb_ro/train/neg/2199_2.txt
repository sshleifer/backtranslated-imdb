I caught "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think we had some big hopes for this film. Unfortunately, this is just another FX business card. The story is pretty tense. Poor illumination and camera work, along with the unusual edition and music, make the movie seem like a low quality. It's too much to ask that FX pants have better stories and have the rest of technical production to match FX! You can not get rid of cool FX in shorts, it has been 5 years since "405" made a big blow. At least so short, cool and even a little funny! None of this can be said about "Sorrows Lost".
