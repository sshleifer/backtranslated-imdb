This movie is terrible. Scenarios of decent or not, the act is very bad, as if you could say I read the line on a card. With the delivery of painful lines by everyone in the distribution. Think of a high school game and a clear lack of actor's interactions (strange breaks between the lines of the different characters, combined with rapid delivery by others). If the movie would be an action, this could be forgiven, but a lot of movies include the set of plot and Family Guy style, irreversibly cut (Oh, wow, they are badly done). I suppose they tried to be fun with them, but it came again like a bunch of high school / college students who left in the afternoon trying to create a funny YouTube video. <br /> <br /> Now, at battle scenes. I'm not too bad, given the quality level seen everywhere in the movie. Nothing too big, certainly not close to the same level as the other posters said (Nothing like Drunken Master). Fights have a superior sensation with LOTS of cuts at different angles, with positions clearly different from those involved. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the type friends involved in this very cheap production. The type you can ask? The same guy who wrote, directed, produced and watched in this masterpiece of the middle school.
