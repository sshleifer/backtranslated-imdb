Actor's first movie is usually something that lets you lose - it's often the first job where the lack of film experience by all the people involved is truly displayed, and this movie is no exception. But worse than that, even after the 1982 standards, this is so bad, it is hysterically funny. Recorded entirely in the Chicago area, on a small budget, most of the actors in the cast are rigid, wooden and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and a bad community drama. The noise in nearby traffic often harbors dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative, in a way that is not forced and efficient rather than natural and organic. The scenes are contrite and agitated, and although the characters go through a period of time, neither children nor adults age at all. I think it is possible to create a tasty Christian film for a gift but often the creators of such films are so focused on the "Message", either in this case, on their own autobiographical links with the project that the good values ​​of film production are thrown away. (Of course it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / publisher - and casting member.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was more interesting - and credible - to watch in his later films. A career like his is certainly not built on movies like this one.
