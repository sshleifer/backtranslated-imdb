Even if it was fun at a distance, this moldy sheet of a film would still be disrespectful. Stopping shortly to jump into boys' bodies and re-introduce "Weekend At Bernie's"? but just just ?? producer Larry Harmon and director of "Ernest" films use copyright as an excuse to crack all the deaths of Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain makes an equitable impression for Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot would not be in tenth place in Stan's appearance contest; even if it were both on the spot in the movie, it will not be less rebellious. The less the surrounding catastrophe, the better. Utopia makes a song of a swan worthy.
