This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people because I hate the noise and I have no idea how the people of the major cities, New York, especially how people do not sleep at all! It amazes me that people can withstand all the noise of our day. The film's basic film is that it makes an interesting subject. It's too bad it's about that. Tim Robbbins is decent, though, except for two scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel who is looking for Margarita Leiveva), he does not seem to be really there. The greatest hope for this film is that casting agents will see an absolutely amazing and talented actress to be defeated, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do but is a beautiful supermodel. Even when she tries to make her look at a closer girl. It makes me sad that there can be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without skills or redeemable talents to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not care too much about this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw some new talents. I hope producers and directors think of Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in the big budget movie. If I can make Megan Fox a star (because she is not so hot and her "talent" is worse than the one made for Disney Channel shows) in a movie, it should happen easily for her, superb and has talent! I would recommend her to change her surname so that we can pronounce it and make it more commercial. We hope that this makes her career and, if there is any justice, she can appear on a summer movie or two in the next few years.
