This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or any other important detail needed to describe a story. This film is just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his male and the rough guy. I totally lost my time watching this movie. The best part should be the final credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my fingers and thrown them to the producers. Anyone who has given the right mind to Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously at the same mental level as he. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could be the only thing you regret.
