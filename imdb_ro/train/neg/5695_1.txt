This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi indicate that this is a humorous gangster film. However, the introduction of ridiculous female lead begins with a series of ridiculous plot overturns that do not do much to hide the controversial end. The film moves between comedy and a surreal drama, with adult scenes out of context. The lively woman (the angel of the title) is badly acting, and the actress is not helped by the scenario that requires some incredible, extreme character to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one to handle his role well, but he is also disappointed with the poor scenario. One to avoid.
