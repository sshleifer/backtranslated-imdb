Eleven "great" movies, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes, each of pure purity, sophistry, condescension, indulgence. Treaties for people from all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt giving me a "hip hip"! for terrorism in its amateur segment. In the green line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel, using eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and to focus on a news reporter. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico focused on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to start the room. Sean Penn, who did not know that there were no buildings in the shadow of the 9-11 Commercial Center. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring everything. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial and clear adventure of love. Ken Loach from the UK focuses on Chile. Etc etc
