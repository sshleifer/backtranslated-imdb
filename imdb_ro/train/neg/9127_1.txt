Okay, so here's the basic story. In 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who has lived for quite some time. The film opens with a birthday party that celebrates drinking a special elixir that (even the film does not mention) prolongs life. Well, on this occasion, the elixir is abandoned by an assistant (Kato if you remember the Pink Panther movies) and ordering the servants to find 6 rare items to make the elixir. This creates a global hunt in which the monks end up robbing the diamond museums and venturing into London to meet the misty doctor Fu, a retired detective Nayland Smith, also played by the Sellers who are trying to stop him supposed to be a funny comic adventure. This was obviously the most recent feature-length film he had made before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he's in it. Sellers who are such a talented comedian and had some memorable roles in Panther films and particularly in the movie "The Party," is something in this movie. This movie was an absolute torture to stay and I could not even end up. He died completely and I continued to cringing while looking at the performance of the vendors. After the great work of "Being there," one year earlier, how I want to say HOW can he do this and how did he do that? As a single person mentioned the first 10..15 minutes I'm ok but then ALL DOWNHILL ... Avoid the plague. Rating 1 out of 10.
