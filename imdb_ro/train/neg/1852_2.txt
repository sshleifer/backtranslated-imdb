Anyone who made this film must have made it a joke. I mean, it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen! A killer snowman terrorizes a small town? Save me. Love when you leave the police. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want a laugh, rent it. If you really want a horror film, stay away from it!
