I have not decided yet whether this will replace Anaconda as "The Worst Movie I Have Ever See". Even if you ignore thin accents, low productions and incredible film work, this movie has absolutely nothing for it. I just went to see him read the book and I wanted to see how the complicated plot would work in a two-hour film. The simple answer is - they did not. Characters appear with little or no explanation as to who they are and then continue to play an important role in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason so that until the film reaches the climax you do not care what happens to any of them. I can accept that on certain occasions the books have to be rewritten to fit into the movies and that it may be unfair to judge this film against the book from which it was adapted. But after I left the cinema I was forced to spend most of the trip home explaining what had to happen. They even change the true meaning of the "Rancid Aluminum" book title by squeezing it into another useless voice piece just to allow the film to have a cool title. A real misery of a movie from start to finish.
