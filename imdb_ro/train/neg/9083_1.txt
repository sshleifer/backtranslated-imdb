It was so terrible. It was not fun at all to look at it at all. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, it's really fun to watch this movie. Again, the scene in which a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if this is the only part of the movie you've been watching, just a girl on the couch using a vibrator. Perhaps he should have released that scene in theaters, maybe the movie would have liked it at a certain level. My advice, before that moment, watch it, scroll the movie, look it up again, scroll, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for two hours. This movie is next to Spit on your grave and the Doom generation in the category of the worst movies I've ever seen.
