I liked how this started, with some decent special effects, especially for a 50-year film. There were quite impressive landscapes. However, the film sinks early enough with a very stupid dialogue because men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius".) Looking at this in the 90's after a long absence, it was fun to see again Francis, an actress who has made the most of TV shows ever since this movie has been released ... and still acts. It was also interesting to see young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not have recognized if it was not for this voice. I've seen half of this movie before boredom almost became overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to bed. I appreciated they made this VHS tape again in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is the overestimated film in which "elites" think it is so "hard" and "provocative of thinking." It's nonsense. He just appeared "smart" because the rest of the science fiction films of the 1950s were so bad! Some, if the early scenes were great on a large scale that I did not have at the time of this writing. Perhaps another aspect - this time on widescreen 2.35: 1 screen transfer will make me change this review.
