We thank G_d for bombing or we might be treated to such delicacies as "Skate Fu" where we can see how Brian Boitano likes to play a triple lutz and bad beats on ribbons with his sharp skates but I move . One thing that could have helped this turkey was a little T & A from Mrs. Agbayani. It's not that the world would have seen something new (at least that part of the world that saw Playboy spread.) I really think pornography would have been more suited to its "talents", though Aubrey Hepburn could not stay on the waterline this channel. An explanation for Kurt Thomas's presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly getting too close to disasters. It is a good thing that the CIO was not as diligent about "doping" as it is now, or Kurt would have certainly been beheaded by his medals. To be avoided at all costs.
