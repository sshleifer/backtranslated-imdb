Horror acts, horrible cast and cheap props. It would have been much better if it was set as a parody of action. What a waste. Starting from the movie name. <br /> <br /> The "enemy" calling it "Action Movie" would have done better. (contributing to parody). The cops looked like a 60-year-old blonde player who always had the same boring face on the face at all times. By the end of the movie, he and she are working together to take down the villains and every time I exchange words, I feel the cheap lines offered in front of a sexual scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste time.
