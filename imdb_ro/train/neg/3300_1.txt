Quite typical of Swedish films of this type. Strange that the act was so bad, these actors usually offer a good show. Casting was bad, made you expect something (I will not tell you what). The main character was terrible ... I do not know where I find it. Anyway, stay away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this is the Swedish action in it is prime.
