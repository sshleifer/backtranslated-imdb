He gave up last night. The opening (2001) lasted for a long time WAAAAAAAAAY. The hitchiker scene did not serve any purpose. Some sketches were retarded. I knew in advance that Chevy Chase went on for less than two minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield Song Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute film Everything else was either unfortunate or bad as hell . Let me give you some tips: If you want a brutal television movie spoofing and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Film". If you want a less abrupt film to spy on television and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise do not bother to rent this movie. You'll save $ 2-3. IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best film is STILL "Problems Modern"
