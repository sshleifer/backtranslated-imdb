After leaving the TV show "The Andy Griffith Show," Don Knotts offered a cinematic story an impressive attempt with a host of ingenious but mature comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, the "Reluctant Astronaut", filmed at cheap prices (as most Knotts films), is far worse than others. Don plays a small schnook city that gets accepted at the Astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as their new goalkeeper! Some might say that poor satire is based on Americans' fresh fever for the new age of technology, but filming is indeed a diminished excuse to keep busy busy children. It starts out in a good start, with a good position and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly idle and idiotic. * from ****
