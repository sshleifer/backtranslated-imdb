Why why? ... did I choose that? Well ... I need a madman in the summer heat, and the lid looks cool. Of course I should have known better. This is a really bad movie. And it gets embarrassed when the producers know it's bad and trying to cover it by adding sexy / beautiful women and sex scenes. Well, people ... do not cut it, do not you! If you wanted a cool movie about a great reptile that is actually very, very good, well played and fun: go rental Lake Placid! (this is an order)
