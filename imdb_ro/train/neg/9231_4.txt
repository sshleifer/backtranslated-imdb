I went to this film thinking that they would be the next clerks, but she let the feeling fall down. The humor was weak and the characters were quite flat. That did not mean it was bad, the idea of ​​dating shop in the grocery store seemed to be quite fertile material, but the director focused on "save Mam and Pop store from the hideous company." I felt like it was just the dating plot, it would have come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to make the movie right, I'm from Rochester and I loved how Webster represented. In fact, Kevin Smith's best honor (clergy) was to offer props in his hometown. Webster, NY is to check what Red Bank, NJ is for the Clerks. The director threw wisely at a meeting at Nick Tahou. Believe me, with regard to what to do in Rochester, there is a litter on the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this movie at the Little Rochester, so everyone knew when they came to the city and appreciated them.
