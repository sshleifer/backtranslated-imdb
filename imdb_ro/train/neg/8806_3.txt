How was this love of "being there" so loved? People say it is proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. He's wrong. The film is proof that luck is everything: we hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari; I hope that the shrimp boat is the only one that we leave on the sea when a storm collapses; I hope you do not die of shock when you're shot hard in your buttocks and not in the back; I hope you will not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactive - all who rebel against the social convention lose their feet, make drugs, beat their girlfriends or die young. In addition, placing products in this movie (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. A manipulative emotional film that is very, very naked.
