Joyce Reynolds seems to be an adult for the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old crazy boy in America who gets rid of a stable guy for a soldier and revolves around the cover of Life magazine all the same week! The unstoppable battle of the goblins, bullshit, and bullshit, such as Janie's little sister bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid), continues to wander after his mother Janie involved in the Red Cross, and Janie's father tries to write an editorial on issues with today's adolescents (such as parents, clogged, sexless Edward Arnold and pert, speaking Ann Harding makes a young man unlikely, even for 1944, seems incapable of helping to conceive a child much less by raising two of them). Nominated for an Oscar (!) For editing Owen Marks, Warner Bros. followed in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have overcome her cohorts until then - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
