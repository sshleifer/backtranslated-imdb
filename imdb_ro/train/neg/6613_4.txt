I'm a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe he made this movie. I was very disappointed. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag is not coming anywhere near the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a spectator. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There is almost no scene with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence in front of the meeting room, with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal, is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have made this film. Ajay and Sushmita sen tried everything they could, but it did not help. Modulation of Rajpal Yadav's voice - inefficient and rather useless. Mohanlal did justice and proved again that the action relates to face expression and body language. The rest of the distribution was below expectations. The comedy situation that was adapted from the original shola fell on flat in this movie. Ram Gopal Varma could have worked on the script, but due to the controversy surrounding the film, he failed and only for his sake to do has made this Aag. But there is no fire.
