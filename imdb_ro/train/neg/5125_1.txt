As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I looked at her. The act was not the best. That's forgiven. It is the message that is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you will do better, you will make stunning snaps, you will stop stammering, you will start attacking and you will even playoffs. All because Jesus is transforming by magic the sublime, feeble, weak in American athletes. I laughed aloud when a coach quoted scriptures to explain to the kicker why the field gaps were missing. But wait, it's not all. You will receive a new truck, a $ 6,000 raise and your fight with your wife with infertility will end abruptly during pregnancy - twice. Then you win the state championship because God helps a weak player to hit the winning field 12 meters further than ever before - and in the wind, no less - because "God wanted him to do it" . Then you win the state championship again next year. None of these good things would have happened if the team had not chosen to follow Jesus in all their hearts. Here's what I got out of the film: God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's about making life better, lighter and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win the games. On what Bible is this story based? I bet that St. Stephen wanted to know the keys to such a safe life before being stoned. Someone should have done this before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed because they followed Jesus. It would have saved them a lot.
