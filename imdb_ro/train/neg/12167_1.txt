Despite the fact that it was a continuation of the original stronger, it is more of a remake of the fun of the Friday the 13th century on the ancient subsequent Angela psychopathic, killing several teenagers for "immorality" them in a camp. Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls, but the film is so (unintentionally) rather than comedic suspense, it is a stinker. * From ****. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for graphic violence and gore, nudity and some sexuality, language and drug use.
