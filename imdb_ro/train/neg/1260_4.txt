Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname Donna Reeds's romanticism played by Tom Drake with the tag! So it allows you to clarify this immediately. From her first role in "The GET-AWAY" (1941), her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Ms. Reed could never be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim act. Whose role at M.G.M. seldom lived up to her talents. Reed is backed by a cast of competent character actors who, unfortunately, have to go through this comedy, supposedly "screws." Clearly M.G.M. it was outside of them to make this type of movie. A better guy produced at COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the "touch" of Ernst Lubitsch nor the spirit of Preston Sturges could save that film. A fairly conventional romantic comedy that had all the signs of a pre-war effort (WWII). If Irving Thalberg had still been alive, the screen would have had to go through a meaningful rewrite or never seen the light of day. It fit into Louis B. Mayer's "safe area," which contained no provocative family entertainment. A form that was unable to cope with the post-war challenges of the DeHavilland decision, the loss of their theater, TV and television, and would contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed, the best days are ahead of her, culminating in "A HERE TO ETERNITY" (1953) and "Oscar" as Best Supporting Actress.
