The film of this film is not at all strong, a lot of holes. If you get close to it as a car movie is not bad, a lot of big cars in this. The reason I like it is that I'm from where she was filmed. I have the greatest joy of looking at places recognized in St. Cloud MN and seeing the city changed from 89. It is an interesting historical piece for new locals. It seems that whenever a movie is made here, everyone wants a relationship with her. It's impossible to find a copy at any of the local video stores because they were all stolen after they came out on the VHS. I had to get a copy of Japan on Ebay. I find it interesting that the traction road is everywhere in town. I did not know the director was from St.Cloud.
