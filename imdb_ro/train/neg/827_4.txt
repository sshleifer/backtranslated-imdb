Salt burned! It is a struggle between two alienated brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of which can trigger psychic fires; they broke up from childhood differences, and Debra Winger was caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the TV behind Moonlighting) blows up the dark comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such a slick presentation, the movie resembles an entry from an enthusiastic film student to a fifteen- millions of dollars . It has prickly energy of a great commercial feature, but a formless form that does not take anything out of the characters except their kooky excentricities. They are not even characters, they are plotting functions. Almost released in theaters, the film is a disaster, though strictly as an example of style on the substance looks good. The extreme is the only stand-out in a cast that really looks puzzled. * 1/2 from ****
