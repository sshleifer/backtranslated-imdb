Let me start by saying how much I like the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man apparently unable to pursue dreams because of his arrogant, manipulating father, it was incredibly easy and fun to look into practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has 10 out of 10 ratings without reservation. This film, on the other hand, is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Almost no essence of the TV show is successfully transferred to the movie. This movie has a very disturbing, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing that Harold is beaten in a pub (and not in a comic way) is not my comedy idea, but it is certainly a reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The film was painfully dysfunctional except for the scene where Albert is left in the sink and seen by a neighbor. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely unclear and makes me wonder if the producers this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the television series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strips. Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's friends were absolutely invaluable in the TV series. In the film, Albert does not say anything when such an opportunity rises. Most spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be pretty dull, with the exception of notable films ON THE BUSES (which in some respects was actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE and SON have to be at the very bottom of the heap, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. My advice - skip this one and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RID AGAIN in return. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to TV series and is actually very funny.
