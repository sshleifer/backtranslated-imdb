I never expect a film adaptation to closely follow the novel (especially a lover as well as the evening), but when I saw the author of the book, Susan Minot, was a screenwriter and executive producer of the film, I thought In the evening, either a good fit. If you enjoyed the book, do not bother with this movie. It is so far from the book that the two do not stand almost any likeness to each other. Here our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris. Harris is the housekeeper's son. Buddy is drunk, in love with Ann and / or Harris. I do not think a single character made it from book to screen; oh, just gets worse with every passing moment. And, indeed, I have not learned from Bridges of Madison County that cutting off the story we have to admire in scenes of our heroes, "raised children who have dishonest and minor struggles, just do not work on the film? movie is a disaster. Get over.
