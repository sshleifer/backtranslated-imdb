If you saw the Sholay movie in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen Sholay since 1975, go to WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that could have gone wrong in making a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychotic villain at the best (probably the only 40 minutes of the bobbin that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch the amitab game with its character, it would still be worth a watch. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not respect his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely bright and the only reason I think they put Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is that he has a striking resemblance to Amitab in his young days. Sushmita Sen does well with grace and makeup. But the award for "Better performance and any role so far" has to go to Nice Kothari. She manages to degrade her action to such levels that even high school drama would put her performance in the spotlight. If you have a mortal enemy, take it to this movie. :)
