A vampire hunter wants to call her after falling in love with a five dollar prostitute in this extremely horrible comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I'm gonna give her a hallucination, but it does not bother. The only redeeming factor (and that's the fact that I'm extremely generous here) might be grandpa who is the only half-story character in this mess. Do not waste money or time. In fact, here's a tip, if Troma puts it on DVD but does NOT make it alone, it's probably shit. Troma DVD Extras: Comment with Omar and Kirk; the second commentary with scenes removed from the scene; bloopers; three interactivity; radar march; Clip from "Terror Firmer" Trailer for "Girls of Rowdy", "Teenage Catgirls in Heat", "Canibila: Musical" and "Avenger Toxic 4" <br /> <br /> My degree: D
