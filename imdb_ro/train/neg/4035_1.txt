I hate to be the rain on a parade (even a small one like that), but from the first scene, you could say that this movie will be an absolute shit. It's a shame indeed, as I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued how they would mix in a movie together, but to my dissatisfaction, they did not even have a scene together! I think I have to repeat this. The two top actors (next to posters and DVD covers) did not have a single scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. That's the only excuse for this film. False advertising. The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unrealistic and non-human. The scripts were pleased, the story was bad, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too much to be fun (and played a poor Tim Tim in the office), no one was full of love, and worst of all, some characters were so annoying that almost led me to stop, because I could not bear to look at them or listen to them anymore. This low-budget stinker was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could not inject some humor and charm into it, but he blessed, he tried. What a waste of time. How could someone evaluate this movie as "ten stars" is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on ... I will not even give some of the top ten stars, while ten stars imply that a movie was perfect. This movie was far from perfect, almost inversely, which meant it was almost completely bad throughout. Look if you want, but if you've seen a lot of movies and you've watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
