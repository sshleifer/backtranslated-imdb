The plot is about a female nurse, called Anna, caught in the midst of chaos all over the world, while zombies who eat meat begin to rise and take over the world and attack the living. She escapes the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually enjoy horror movies, but this movie does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even thrilling, even ridiculous. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more enthusiasm. It's like you've seen a bunch of blood-thirsty drunkards who can not enter a mall with more liqueurs. The heroes who have stuck inside the mall to avoid being eaten by others are not better. Even if they do not seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. Save your money instead of spending it!
