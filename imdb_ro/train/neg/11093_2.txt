If this film was fictional, the film could stand alone and could be judged objectively. Unfortunately, for the spectator, the film is based on "facts" that are very unkindly shadowed by Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were not taken into account (Carter was not a candidate number at the time of the killing, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a baby mole in the youth), but some of the larger facts, being robbed of a decision against Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexplicable for those of us who saw the fight on the band, and completely disrespectful of Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero of someone who at best has problems and around issues much more than any ordinary person should be (he was arrested several times to beat women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, seeing his actions in the 1960s and right now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person people can search for. Everyone knows Everson can drive, and Washington can act, but why choose this story because their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so necessary by a black hero that it must bend the truth in all of their bio to make them credible? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now, that's inspired.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest going through this.
