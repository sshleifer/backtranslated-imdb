I took the movie from Blockbuster on one of these shelves if you could get 5 movies for $ 20. I should have said that I took the money for that. I expected a horrible dialogue, scary monsters and cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three is not bad. The act is bad, though not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low-budget movies, I recently missed the prospect. There are some bits where the acting is really terrible, but it is mostly at least high school. CG for Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second. The first thing I thought when I saw him (and I noticed another commentator agreed with me) was that a man in a monkey suit would have been better. Clunky's stop-motion animation would look better. So you probably wonder why I call CG the worst part of the worst. That's because the worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are loud, annoying and constant. I was camping, I know what insects sound like in the forest at night, and while they can be loud, they are not deafening as cacophony in this movie. Usually, when the sounds of the "background" sound out of the dialogue of the movie, it is a bad thing, but from what we got from the dialogue of this film, I do not miss too much. The action was unusual and boring. The tension was nonexistent, like any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of characters, they were all cutters and gentlemen. The only gentle move was between ... in fact, I can not think of anything. It was a line or two that made me break a huge smile, but that was about it. The cinema was decent, a step or two over what you normally see in a movie like this one. Still, he still had the quality "home movie" that you get with the pocket change movies and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and get a blow from budget budget budget shoestring, and you see it in the dollar basket, think about catching it. Otherwise, stay away at any price.
