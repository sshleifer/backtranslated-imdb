I know, I know, "Plan 9 in outer space" is the worst movie or maybe "Manos, the hands of fate". But I can not handle socks. From * course * are bad. How could they be good? But if you talk about movies with respectable production values ​​and banking talent, T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl". All the gentleness, the self-absorbed self, the spots that Barbra Streisand has made since 1964, reach his climax in this film. From his horror loneliness peak, "Yentl" looks back at "A star is born" and moves forward to "Mirror has two faces". There is nothing quite like it. How emotional she shot Streisand to make this film, I would not speculate and what advertising is playing, I can not even imagine, though I bet there is a nine out of ten chance not to be a member of it. /> <br /> Nobel Prize winner and holy guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so indignant about what he did Streisand with his story that he publicly beat for her. It is a tribute to Streisand's implacable vulgarity that she not only did not commit suicide but has made many terrible movies.
