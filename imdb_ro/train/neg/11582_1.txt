I'm glad to see that most other people do not think much about this movie. She has some big names in the cast, but that's all. There is nothing to recommend, except the ogling a few beautiful women you can do in a thousand movies. The story only involves characters that can not be personalized, self-centered, smoking, hip, national film critics seem to like ... and most of the public can not resist. <br /> <br /> The accents from Oklahoma are so fake that they are ridiculous, the racist stereotypes in the south are even from Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
