What the hell! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for that ... but one of those who go to horror reviewers finds it disappointing. The man was right on his nose! This movie was driven by pure amateurs. They should have done only once, maybe two on each scene, the movie seemed to hurry. The script was also poor ... they had lines that tried to be unique, but they did not succeed. Miserable. "Get your flesh off me!" Man, I hate it when movies try to do that. It's always happening with comedies ... but with a horror movie and actors below the media ... the results are incredibly pathetic. Rows and scenarios were very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this movie was again the act of cursing. It was awful. Besides the little Asian guy who worked at the cabin. I thought it was great. The movie is about 5 stupid dumbash t tourists who are on a holiday in Asia. They arrive in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a Hungarian / slave sex. Sounds like a cold story. But chasing someone with an unpleasant diarrhea case is probably more fun and more intentional to follow. The only reason why this is considered horror is because of killing. It was not a trace of suspense. I like that many other fans of horror have died to get their hands on their bosom. But, unfortunately, with a huge U capital, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I liked the ankle break and the effects of the blood. Angry chickens were also so. Everything about this movie amateur screaming. This is the first length of Ryan Nicholson, and for the most part failed. There is no doubt that he has a sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray that the next movie will not play as another B-shot ... unless it tells us it will be what it will be. Even after this disappointment, I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I have seen from him, he is a true man, dedicated to the genre. Good luck next time, because it was bad news.
