The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I have very much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not so special. I think I managed to find so good effects from what I saw around the house. I wish I could say something about this movie, but I'm afraid I do not. Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey. I, after a small thought, have a good thing to say about this movie - it's over.
