Why does this film fall far below standards? Finally, the answer lies in the poor, humorless script. A thin / medium Travolta (looking in black, I have to say, even with a thick grill) and Gross, act very well as two young men dressed but still diminished by the New Yorkers eager to open their own club night. Besides, the rest of the movie is just boring to watch. It is so boring that it does not deserve to know what is happening in the climax of the film at any level. Kelly Preston obviously avoids sex appeal, and sex with his father Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite fun to watch how the KGB "Bob Smith" is fighting. Personally, I think the movie would have been better if the plot was slightly changed so the settings did not change from NY to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you will understand if you see the movie ... Apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for the 1987 release. I think Paramount stopped to release the film by January 1989 because of the incredible plot. They were reported to have considered that they "can not be released". However, this $ 6,000,000 movie earned slightly more than a $ 163,000 embarrassing income because it was released just BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before going straight to the video. This is the proof of the overall quality of this film.
