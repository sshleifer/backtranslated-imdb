This movie has no beginning or end. And it is really VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley should be interned working in a mailroom for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason, they are placed in a 5 star hotel (conveniently located along the Colosseum street), and all the other interns with whom they work are as abnormally as they are. One thing we've obviously found in this movie is how one of the twins DOES NOT end up with the guy. I think they tried to twist an ordinary plot. Good try.
