I wanted to watch this movie, but a ridiculous bizarre scene after another forced me to shut it down. The character does not seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger walks a night (through a cemetery that I believe) when attacked by spirits, which he removes. Once past this attempt, he calms calmly and meets a friend who has seen everything. When asked what is going on, he gently says "attacked by demons, nothing serious", as if this is just a little more interesting than a flat tire. I stopped her when I asked for something - a demon or something, I stopped the care - a questionnaire. The answer can only be rented from someone with the energy of death, and the priest looks at what appears to be vague annoyance, as a man is tightened and hung, and asks him the question of his body that dirty. br /> 0 stars from star ****.
