Well, better if you intend to sit on this amateur and old scene and hurry a middle-aged widow who has more in common with her teenage girl or her adolescent daughter than she wants. Located in Tunis, Mom falls in love with the apartment, gets sick and decides, though reluctantly (can not help), dancing the costume and dancing in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian drummer. This movie is so full of stuff I saw the DVD at x2 and I read the subtitles, repeating quickly through many of the most common dances and walking headaches (walking all over) and more going on down and just comforting at x4 just to get this boring, unequivocally low budget move that some have gathered some pretty good placards. Realize. (C)
