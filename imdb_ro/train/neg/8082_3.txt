It was one of those late nights "It's there," I saw things. Sometimes they are wonderful. It was terrible, but it really should not have been. The film had a very good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about Oscar lawn here. It had good special effects. She even had very good breasts! And I mean well, chest filled with full nipple and at some point even a beaver. But did not compensate the missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean to say that "the sun of the solar crisis" is exploding, but that was pretty bad. It was the rest of things - things so stupid and totally predictable for bad corporations. Dude who just STANK! No quantity of good action ships or cool space or battle scenes could get around that one. I've seen the same cast members are incredibly good. I've seen wonderful science fiction movies with miniaturized and tiny budgets. All the difference is written.
