As we love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. An advertising hack at the end of what seems to have been a distinguished career and the idealist Pacino plays its role as an awkward bed and aggresses everyone with an extremely fake and inconsistent accent. so wound in this way and with so many free heads and improbes that the mind revolves (and then retires). Kim Basinger is there, he does not do much. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. Leone Tea, on the other hand, lights the screen. She was electric, and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting of the film, but they were not enough to save Al de jena.
