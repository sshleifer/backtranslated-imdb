I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. I managed to stay to the end. It was a painful experience. I liked English, but I think she had to eat like us and so she accepted to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest may be called "art" or something I could not express but which I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've ever seen is an accident, but I'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to pursue it successfully. ; A)
