SPOILERS AHEAD This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's so simple. There is no ransom quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are pretty tricky - in fact, they made you think this movie will be shocking and will put you on the edge of your chair. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes while watching scenes that have been stolen and badly done without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their advanced teleporting powers, such as Alex Thomas, which falls into the lake, then ends up in its pot in an impossible position. Angie Harmon made a miserable interpretation as Kate worsened by the space-time interrupted dialogue that seems to have been written by a fifth-grade student at the last minute. An example would be when he said, "Lantern!" in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold for how much the human body can collapse before it fits in half. Finally, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrible one I've ever seen. It was like the cameramen a bunch of chimps to which scientists gave her camcorders. An example of this would be when we suddenly get a detail of the lighthouse on Alex's car. I would bet that there was not much time for editing this movie. The end was absolutely pathetic. The writers have obviously tried to create a kind of mysterious plot that made the visitor say, "Yes, yes!" Instead, we are left to see some paintings chosen by a spider that fits somewhat in the story line. Unfortunately, there is no prospect in millions of people who could save this movie from being a foolish piece of nonsense. I gave this a .5 out of 10, 5 being in fact that this movie was recorded on the film instead of becoming an illustrated book.
