I usually try to be professional and constructive when criticizing movies, but GOD! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Evil acts, bad effects, bad script, everything bad! <br /> <br /> The park follows a group of adolescents clich√© on the way to a rave (taking place in the light of the day) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all I find is a naked dance and bloody clothes. In order to find out what happened to the other party participants, the clan set is on a mission through a forest infested by zombies. During this crusade, they are assisted by a policeman and a captain of the sea who happens to have the correct number of weapons to give to each of his children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of badly directed action sequences, including a long shot outside the "house of the dead". This battle was complemented by Hollywood's fearsome violence, HOTD video redundancy clips, and the unprecedented rotation of the matrix-esque cameras. One of the character's volunteers sacrifices to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and courageous, but because part of his face was shaken by an acid, a zombie spit on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it was deactivated! Should I be sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To summarize everything, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie, unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater we were in was more deadly than the screen zombies, and I'm sure the money we lost, seeing this piece of money, could easily cover the costs of doing it. Grade: F
