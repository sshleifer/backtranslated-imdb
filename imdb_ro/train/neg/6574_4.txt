(Avast, light spoilers ahead) I took this tape from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. I went to Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum there I saw the citrus city program in May 1954. The films will change into theater every day. Since there would not be a TV for another decade in these parts, it was much of the entertainment available in the city. "Raid" seems to have been done for cities like Matewan in the 1950s. Although not listed for that month, I'm sure I showed up there Monday or Tuesday night for an audience that probably was not too demanding. The historic breeze - bold and remarkably successful - does not seem to have been well researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood ornaments, including a brilliant gun played by Lee Marvin. Marvin uses the opportunity to practice freedom. And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming in and passing through the city than Washington DC. What made me crawl was when the fighters turned into uniforms of their confederacy. Only in civil war paintings the Rebel uniforms look so bright. When Anne Bancroft's son caught Van Heflin in his uniform, just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. And then there is Anne Bancroft herself. While watching the movie, I actually looked at IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The actress of the contract at that time did not look anything like her subsequent films and has no presence she would have later in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and, of course, "The Graduate". It is worth seeing if only 1). live in St. Albans and 2). you have a few hours to kill Hollywood's fictional story of the biggest story in the home town.
