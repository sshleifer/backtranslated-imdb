Anyone who wrote "Redline" as a great car movie needs to be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this pile of scary, very scary, amateur carpet steam. Easily the worst car movie or any movie ever made. This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. Take each cheese clich√© from a series of action television series of the 80s, put some really crappy special effects and blade characters of no relevance, and you have the vivid proof that Daniel Sadek does not write scripts and produces movies but should stay in real estate business. This is such a blade movie with a plot of both blades and the most controversial sequences of action ever. What pisses me off is not that the producers of this film are idiots, but they think the movie is public enough stupid to fall for that bullshit.
