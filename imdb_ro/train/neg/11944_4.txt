I hired this movie thinking it was the sad version of 1959 that I saw as a child. It was not. So I was very disappointed with what I felt about the marginal attitude, the poor development of character, and especially the failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "Dog of Flanders" is just a cute "aside" to the film. Get the 1959 version!
