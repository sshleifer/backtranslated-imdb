The delicate connection between this film and the first fat is set right at the beginning of the film, when Didi Conn, one of four band members, repeating their roles, approached young student Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in the previous film, Olivia Newton, Saint John's foreign speech model is not explained, here is explained, Caulfield is her cousin. What Conn still does in school, I think he just likes to stay around Rydell High, even if it's cosmetics now. Caulfield is an intelligent child, so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed call him a nerd. And that's very bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides he likes Caulfield. But being a nerd simply will not cut it. Then Caulfield decides to face a modern Zorro act. He gets a junked bike and puts it back together and learns to walk around. He becomes a leather bicycle suit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If Michelle Pheiffer is not in books, Caulfield will have no trouble making friends at any bar of homosexual men as he is equipped. The anointing 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and began their successful career careers enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease movie, a better movie than you definitely have an idea of ​​how this movie will be made. Besides Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all of the faculty members in Grease's initial return to their roles. The score of music is not as good as the songs that come from the original. It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's not that great.
