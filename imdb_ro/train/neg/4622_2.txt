No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The moment of release was terrible. The Gong show would have "jumped on the task" until the movie came out, so who would pay the money just to see some censored clips from the original version of the show? And spectacle clips are just a small part of this pathetic, 90 minute Chuck Barris's cry about how hard his life has been as host of the show. Did he really expect us to feel bad about him and his frightened millionaire life? Did he really think we really wanted to know about his life? (Obviously, since he later wrote his strange autobiography about his CIA operative career.) Does he think the gag to have everyone, wherever the audition for him would remain fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network directory that finds it at every step? This could have served as a scene for a 30-minute sitcom, but not as an entire movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor again, Gene Gene and Comic Unknown (though, to make the movie "spicy", included only the most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartman's first important film (even if it takes only a minute). Write down his name is written HARTMANN in credits, which is the name with which he was born. You can not lose your voice and facial expressions, even if it is much thinner and younger than in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the world of soap.
