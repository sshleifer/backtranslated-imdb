I do not remember going out of a cinema except that once. Not only that, but we were with 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, clay characters, violence without a point. I did not care when the good guys died; I did not care when bad guys did it. Fantasy and magic were lying thick like a liver pudding, and there was no coherence. In short, enjoyable fun if there is an eternity in hell.
