When this movie was released in 1997, "special effects", like them, were weak. These would be dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same SFX work or better. Of course, no one was involved in the production of this film in search of an Oscar. It's a wild move from the usual stuff of director Fred Olen Ray, most of which have the word Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls on Lost Planet, etc., and are little more than T & A movies here we are with a movie on "U" and we headed directly to children. You have to give him credit for diversification! This was a small direct hit from the video cult, which later led to a few sequels - the invisible mother 2 and the invisible father. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career descended quickly after the '80s, "ET") plays the "invisible mother" of the film title and will return for the continuation of Russ Tamblyn (whose career was in the longer autumn of 1961 "West Side Story") interprets Dr. Woorter. It is quite fair to say that most of the cast was at the time of his career where he would have been ready to work on almost anything other than paying the bills of that month - except maybe young Trenton Knight like Josh. But rather, he says that although he worked before this film, this actor did not work again after continuing with "Invisible Mom 2". for a child actor, he's good enough - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars. As mentioned above, the effects of "invisibility" are at least a little, the direction is weak, the obvious writing and doing nothing to write about. There are a lot of things in the movies there, though, and for anyone under the age of about ten, this movie will undoubtedly be quite watched. Most adults will probably want to make their own disappearance, while it is still, and I would not blame them for a bit!
