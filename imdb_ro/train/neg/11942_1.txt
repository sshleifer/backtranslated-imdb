Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time! It starts badly and gets damaged. Katherine Heigl is a great mess in a Lolita role, and Leo Grillo is struggling to handle what is essentially a cardboard cut. The only member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who makes him a bastard and goes completely overboard with his role. The scenario is terrible, horrifically acting and has large enough holes to drive a double bus! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely unsatisfactory. She saw her as a mischievous and despondent seduction, which attracted the poor, innocent, married man to deceive his wife. It is assumed throughout the film that it is minor, and the message that accompanies that part of the plot just required faith! Finally, she can not even be redeemed by shooting the man who, obviously (ha!), Becomes demented with anger and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, redeeming himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Horrible. Do not waste time.
