This is the biggest lam song I've ever seen. It is boring that he would rather have been sitting through a seminar on creationism than watching this if I knew it would be as boring as it would have been. Not even 40 seconds of chick in bikini with great talent risk this with nothing less than a 1. Reviews of this film that claim this movie is "nonintentional funny" are absurd and simply WRONG. It's not funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 minutes of walking through the woods talking about things that you do not understand and do not care about and are as lame when people start to die because you do not even know who they are because they are so unintelligent. Honestly, however, I did not follow him until the end, but I should say something about how horrible he is. SMALL EVENTS. Immediately after I removed this dirt from my DVD player, I began scraping it from my house in front of my house, not wanting other successful customers to have to fall over the same mistakes I made to rent this movie. Then Zach touched his pants. Thanks for your time.
