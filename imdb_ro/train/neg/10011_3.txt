This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of strong men's wives. I thought "The Walker" would be thrilling and hired, but I was so wrong. Pacing is painful and painfully slow, and nothing happens after 40 minutes of film. Seriously, the first hour could be condensed in ten minutes. That's how slow it is. The lack of any emotions or action scenes exacerbates boredom. It is almost shocking that the argument scenes are so clear and lacking in emotion. Perhaps it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? It's sad that "The Walker" becomes such a dull mess, despite a strong distribution. Bring him to the poor plot and even worse.
