First, before reading further, you have to understand that they are not neo-Nazis, I just try to understand Hitler correctly to make sure no one takes him again. series and found it terrible. I mean, it's interesting to look, but is it true? I looked for answers and found one: Absolutely not. First, Hitler was not upset all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter; in fact, Hitler is very likely to have been gay and fighting all his life to suffocate this secret. Third, people will hate me, but it is true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so ugly and ugly? Because it was charming. This is a common point that we found in interviews with people living near or far from him (of course, not Jews). This series was terrible, because if you think Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly and, of course, not charming, you're wrong. If you think so, you will allow people like him to take power in countries and you do not want that. If you really understand how Hitler was able to come to power and you do not think it terrible, you can find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember that he was elected) and stop the topic before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is important to be protected, this series is terrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler, another will happen exactly as he did the first.
