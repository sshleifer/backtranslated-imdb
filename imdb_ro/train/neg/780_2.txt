This show is terrible. How is George wanted the death of his funny mother? This show is terrible. Parents are clearly horrible and children should be taken to children's services. The daughter is a witch with a b, and the son is just a complete boy. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his name Spanglish, strong and incoherent. Ernie is a loser, but at least I chikotat him a few times, but especially how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible, disparaging character. Sure, her husband left her, but how one can laugh at how he treated George as a child is beyond me. Can anyone explain how George's head is great is fun? It's not even that big! I moved from the characters because I'm too awful and it would take me a few hours to write and, frankly, I do not care too much. I'm pretty worried about telling anyone who's looking at it and wondering if she wants to watch this show or not, that this show is a stupid excuse for a sitcom and it's not worth your time. 2 begins because the wife is extremely attractive.
