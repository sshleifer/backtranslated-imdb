Django's ballad is a disturbing mess of a movie! This Western spaghetti is simply a collection of scenes from other movies (and much better!) Allegedly related to "Django", saying how he brought different laws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to Django's role. Jump over this unless you just have to have every Django movie made and even can not be an excuse enough to see that!
