Imagine being asked about the date you wanted to see the movie and remember to see a quite interesting trailer about "The Grudge". So, in good faith, we recommend watching that movie. This is the Halloween season, after all. And he made boffo box office this past weekend, so he has to be pretty good ... so you go. And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends like it does, and you hear it say loudly, "That's not the end of the movie ..." But unfortunately it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine yourself coming out of the shame and cinema cinema for recommending such a dog to a movie. Do you think your date thinks you're a trap for suggesting such atrocities and your suggestion will surely end a promising relationship. In fact, it was so bad that we both laughed at how bad it was. I do not see any future for Mrs. Gellar in the movies and suggests she will stay on TV in the future. In fact, it will not be long before she is sent to flea market conventions and sell Buffy's memorabilia and it can not happen soon enough if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The plot did not make sense; continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the whole end was designed to have a "Grudge II - The Return of" Cat-Boy "."
