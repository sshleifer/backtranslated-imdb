If another Hitler will ever appear, he will be partly content with the crap that this film, which propagates the absurd idea that he was a visibly disturbed madman from the start. Far from following such a person and choosing him at the highest office in the country, healthy people would cross the street to avoid and die in a ditch without name and unknown. read the accounts of Hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary, Traudl Junge, for example - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kind, intelligent and generous man. He was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem to be exaggerated and the ears of the modern ears ignore the times when they were made when the stupidity of pomposity was common in political speeches. Beyond the exaggerated antisemitism, which was not a central issue to the early Nazis - which were primarily anticommunist - and not unusual or unusual for the times. The film makes it look like we were Hitler's only ambition from the beginning was the Holocaust. If you want to identify the next person who will cause the deaths of tens of millions, you can ignore the life ravee presented here. Look instead for a charming charismatic man, whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work is visibly and materially beneficial to the country. I'm afraid his personality will be more akin to Barack Obama's than Fred Phelps's. I've been hoping a lot here and I only have a caricature. The fools who have done so have committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
