After reading the first 5 reviews of IMDb, I was very excited about this movie. But it's a terrible movie, the total time you see the stranger is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is a suspense inexpensive), the action is over the story, oh boy, this story? The story does not seem to go in one direction, it first captures the stranger (after 7 years! I finally succeed), then she does not know what to do with her (after 7 years?) and even wants to release him (why did the hell capture him?). Then the girlfriend, who acts is the highest, wants to get away from this madness, then suddenly does not do it, then does it and then does it. Then they conclude that killing the alien will kill the entire human race (and I remember that in all those years no other man has seen these aliens definitively established) and what do they do? They torture and blow a bunch of aliens in birds. This is my first review of IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very soon, so listen to my warning: move is not worth the time, do not watch this movie.
