Pretty average, even by Monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of the Sphinx) has a strange plot that does not come too far - you'll see through it after about ten minutes. The two leaders have a beautiful dialogue at first, but John Hamilton is boring sperm, while the villain (Lionel Atwill, who performed it perfectly) and Warren Hymer's Shtick are pretty annoying. However, it is worthwhile to stand for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland, as Nicodim goalkeeper, who gets better with the defense attorney during a hilarious room look. You have to give Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not a director, but he would always have a routine programmer with some vagabonds.
