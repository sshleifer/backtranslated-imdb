This romantic comedy is not too bad. There are some fun things going on here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters in it. The act, however, is amateur (except for the banker). While some scenes are very funny, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the poor story. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's worth seeing if you like soccer comedies and romance. It's not a bad movie, and the end felt pretty good. Do not expect anything ordinary. Quite right if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
