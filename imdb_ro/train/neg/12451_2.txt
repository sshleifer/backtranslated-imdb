This movie is hilarious, not in a good way. Fighting is terrible, while sometimes it will try to shock you by breaking bones, and even this happens two or three times, it is certainly not enough to call it a shock shock. A blow of fire means that a hero can go to an open field, with 10 people shooting him with a wolf, picking up a gun, starting to pull back and not hurt himself. <br /> <br /> The naked story, the boy waking up, losing his memories, begins to beat, for that's good. Five years later, the memories are coming back, blaming the avenger. <br /> <br /> It's not worth the money, it's really not worth the time unless you're drunk and bored.
