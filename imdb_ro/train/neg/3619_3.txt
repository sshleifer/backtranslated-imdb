Basically, there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. Ok, first of all when you make a movie, you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the movie can be watched. Parents divorced and argued that they were in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that completely ruins the movie! I expected to see a movie similar to BOOGMYMAN, and instead I watched a drama with some senseless thriller spots. 3 out of 10 only for parents and descent dialogs. As for Jake's photos: ignore them.
