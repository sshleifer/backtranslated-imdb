I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can not figure out why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some of which the summary of the plot says: "But what Satan does not know is blocked by angry tourists." Well, they did not seem to disturb him in the movie, just me. The only good thing about this movie is the actor playing Satan, I like the bad movie, but it was just boring.
