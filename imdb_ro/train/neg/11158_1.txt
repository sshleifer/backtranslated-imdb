What horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of cliques I have seen for a long time. Not that I've seen much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes looking for a hard drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was terrible as usual. How many injured and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that he could act? In trying to be politically correct, this film encourages racial stereotypes. (Professor of lonely music without experience claims the violons of underprivileged children in the neighboring poor school). The kids were not really cute! Just written to fit awful writing. Aaargh! Wes Craven made me change my mind once. this real horror!
