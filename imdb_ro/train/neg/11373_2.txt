It is not obvious from watching this film (so I recommend viewers to look for people who present their case), but this presentation of the realities of Islam and the encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectivity and also completely manages to influence the human state. It is a matter of showing that the Qur'an says many things about how a devout Muslim is bound to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to understand that not every man who feels himself as a descendant of Islam is agree and respect all the principles of that belief and system. There are reasons to call a lot about the presenters concerned, so viewers have to see the show with healthy skepticism; do not swallow anything, the hook, the line, and the diver, without thinking of your own. One specific, for example, is Walid Shoebat's research; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise men who do not even believe in these statements. I am not, nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Qur'an. I am not a Christian or a member of the faith. But I am a smart man and discernment. While the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some Muslims see their duty to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as they are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, there are variations in the intensity of faith and obligation between Jews and Muslims. When watching this movie, you must have the salt shaker on your hand. A grain will not be enough, you will need more. Use your own mind and think for yourself, explore what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits into it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put the film together, indicating a certain bias. Be your brain.
