Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. Hollywood produced films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 has changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. The most important and devastating, has changed our world. However, I can not emphasize how repulsive, disillusioned and angry I am to the careless ignorance of Hollywood that seeks to make a profitable profit from death and destruction. This film and those of this kind are bound to provoke controversy in the middle of word-of-mouth between movies and critics alike; certainly be resumed by the mainstream. Hollywood sank to a new low. Even smaller than the bottom bastards who have done the most barbarous acts of wilderness and cruelty unremitting. Behind her is Uwe Boll. I'm very upset about this movie. How dare I not respect the memories of the families of the lost? How dare I mock the lives of brave men and women who have scattered their lives to save those who have been kidnapped in towers convicted on that fatal day of infamy? How dare I try to satirize and at the same time take advantage of a national tragedy in the mist of a painful and tired world after 911? !!!!! How ... dare ... they? <br /> <br /> For those who have the misfortune to even think of seeing this moral travesty, I say this with a hard heart with all my strength: Remember. Think about that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a healthy and moral person. Think about that day, wonder if this movie is or not a shame and dishonor to the lost lives of that day. Think on that day of the cry of the families of your loved ones. Think about that day of lost lives on the two planes. Think of the subsequent massacre of the attacks. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think. Remember. Respect the memories of lost lives in 911 if you do not see this movie at all.
