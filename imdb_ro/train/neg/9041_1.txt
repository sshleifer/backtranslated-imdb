I liked the movie despite the rhythm of frenzy. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was called Montana Nord. It's definitely not Montana North and will never be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is why. Stop teaching children in the United States to believe they own the planet. Such a centrist view of the world does not turn into one of the great nations of the world. Even in jest. I would never refer to the US as "Alberta Sud". Walt would never put us down, why start now. Apart from the fact that the movie was pretty weird, more luck next time.
