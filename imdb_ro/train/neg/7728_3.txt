.... this mini is no better with age. We have seen this and continued when it first broadcast, and as many others have been rejected. At the beginning of 2002 I borrowed novels both for WOW, W and R and was even more impressed. Then I decided I had to see again and invest 200 bucks plus on DVDs. I saw the ministers again in painful details again, and I realized I had done things back - I should have bought the novels and borrowed the DVD. Do not you think it's a miserable lady? Read novels and see for yourself. Do not you think it's dated? The screen for someone who is not old enough to have seen that it was originally broadcast and to follow the reaction you receive (warning - the reactions of such people range from horror to laughter). this mini-Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Hopa !! Production quality, musical scores, dialogue - a wonderful story has been turned into a soap operas at the end of the 70s by a very ambitious producer / director who was overwhelmed. This was dated when it was completed. These two ministers were great when they first broadcast to those of us who saw them then, a trailer to a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO - This mini is not close to its reputation and disappoints itself seriously.
