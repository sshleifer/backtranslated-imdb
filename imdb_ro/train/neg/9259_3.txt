"The Omen 4: The Awakening" is a continuation of the film for the original film "The Omen". Instead of Satan, who possesses the body of a little boy, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who is assaulted at school and who ends up revenge against those who do evil. The film seems to struggle with any horror factor and many events that happen are simply foolish, not even scary, and it is hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround her. We have not found this very suspenseful or frightening film, especially when compared to the original.
