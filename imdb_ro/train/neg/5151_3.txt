I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was badly executed. We have a wide sense of how complex and challenging the backstage is, but practically there is no specification of how it works. Producers do not seem to have found a way to tell a story or to give the viewer a "line through line". (Which does not mean they did not try, but having the scene links refers to a synopsis of the Ring cycle, because the narrative of the program does not say anything about the physical work of a work.) <br /> <br /> We see that a lot of things happen, but little is said about what people do and why. There is little sense of who he is or how the different production departments fit and work together. For example, I have heard a few times about a problem of a sort - she then expects to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is resolved. Instead, filmmakers have just cut off to something else (generally generic pictures of people pushing things or talking in headphones). Generally, the movie ends up feeling more like a paste of the pictures you would see run under the closing credits of a show, rather than something worth watching for your merits.
