It took an excuse to get out of the house while the paint was dry - it left the film an hour later to return and see the dry paint. I do not remember going on a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to distribution and just kept "going and going" stupid - come on! Uma Thurman is doing these things? Very special effects blades. These were older characters and actors who make superficially superficial 20-something of life - just a kind of annoying and wrong feeling. This review is basic only in the first hour - it may have gotten better. I had to go home and see if the paint had darkened the darker color than when it went on.
