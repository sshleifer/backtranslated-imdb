After seeing credits with a single name that I recognize and who was the preacher of this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect too much on this movie and I was not disappointed. A man intends to kill his new wife by convincing others that he is crazy and will take his life. It is not known to the husband that the plastic skull, which he uses, instead, a ghost of a woman, apparently the first dead wife, takes revenge on his mind and uses a real skull. A simple plot, with a turn of irony at the end. If you are tired late one night and need sleep, this will help you sleep that you sleep.
