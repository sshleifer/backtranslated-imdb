Perfect killing is prevented when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who led this episode) who kills her husband with poker has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she moves the body outside ... escaped a mad madman dressed in a Santa Claus (played by a hideous noisy Larry Drake). She faces her life as she tries to find a way to hide her husband's body. She decides to use an ax once she leaves the Santa killer who loses more chances to cut the woman's head to fit the killer for killing her husband. Santa hangs her in a closet and watches the woman's daughter as she desperately tries to free herself to save the baby. This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material that involves the old "Santa Kills" theme by adding also the routine of those who were used (add to the museum) the murderers-her husband-for-a-man was -deception. In essence, Trainor is trying to find a way to avoid getting caught with a body he kills while keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot that goes quite far through the movements. This is not one of the most important moments of the show.
