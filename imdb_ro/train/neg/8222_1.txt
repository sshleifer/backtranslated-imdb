Um ... Okay, I guess I got all the gorilla-like shooting technique, but unfortunately I think a gorilla might have made a better movie ... This was just a complete mess from the departure . Bad action, evil director, bad story and terrible cinema. As this garbage was released, I will never know, but unfortunately I saw it. Filmed in the Tennessee location by director Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across the Eyes," I suppose he should look like a "Blair Witch" movie, but he's short. .. Well, the nose sinks from a rock. I was actually ashamed for these young women, whom I'm sure I promised a Hollywood story, but I got into this pile of rubbish. Dialogue is ridiculous and actually worsens you as you listen to it. How should a horror hit be another mystery, because there is nothing terrifying about it except that I looked at it ... Try this for size: there are 5 of you and 1 of them, do the math and beat her ass ... "End". Unfortunately, it continued (and on) another 95 minutes of stupidity ... I saw it for free and I wanted my money back.
