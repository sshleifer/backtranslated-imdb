She made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. He was well shot from the start, but this is the last positive comment I have on the film. The actor was terrible, I wonder if the current gogo girls have been hired? But it was the park that was really ridiculous, actually it was ridiculous and not boring is the only reason I gave it this 3/10. ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention some of the scenes that made the audience laugh. Shooting a girl in the field: Who would have thought a child throwing another child could be so badly acting. A true eye-opener. Getting on the bus stage: the girl gets on the bus. But, according to music, the world is over. Running under the line of clothes: Wow, it really demonstrates the abilities of the plot writer. In the room, followed by raw meat and skill sales. Why not just make her make all three "sins" at once? At least then the movie could have been a little shorter. Run through the stairs of the mall: look like one of the girls take flight on the stairs pursued by a meat eating Dau, do not wait. she is * just walking fast trying not to break her nails. Running covered in the blood: this is definitely my favorite scene, and an end of matching the movie. A red paint semimaraton, completed by the steps of the stairs and the bridge, only to be sent with the most unrealistic flight of a passing car. Not only that, but this suicide is done by the most obsessed girl in the movie, now related to the character for you. I would like to think that this film was created for 16 years by elders and their colleagues. Unfortunately, once you met the director at the presentation, this is not the case. But if you have a sarcastic mood and you like to laugh with a few colleagues, then do not even think about it.
