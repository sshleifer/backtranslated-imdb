Unfortunately, this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the true story of "Studio 54". The only thing that was good about the picture was "Mike Myers," which was a joy to watch. "Neve Cambpell", although his role was small was unfortunately bad. The conclusion is that this film did not perform well with actors except one and that the transformation of the true story was a desperate attempt of good script.
