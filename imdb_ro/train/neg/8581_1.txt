This excuse for a movie is absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed money. The film must have been made at a very low budget, because lighting was not there. I made an oath if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor commit suicide. I would be happy to find out if there is 1) a plot or 2) a scenario. My biggest regret is that I lost my time when I looked at this garbage.
