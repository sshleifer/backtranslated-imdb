What a bunch of pants. After reading religiously Chris Brookmyre's books since I came across "Pretty Ugly ...", I was delighted to learn that this drama had been ordered. We had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and it does not fit perfectly. How can someone read the book and then adapt it to this piece of slag is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The whole characters are changing, the situations are dropped and the parabla- bibling fast and the sliding open a golf window ... brought tears to my eyes. I'm afraid to think what will happen to "The Land of the Blind" if this is the point of reference ... Please just avoid ...
