Pathetic ... worse than a bad movie made for television. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, the character Morgan Freeman continues to talk and say "pussy" when referring to boyfriend NSync. Morgan Freeman who calls women "pussy" is just weird ... What the hell were the people who were thinking about this movie? Too many plot holes I've imagined combined with horrific drive, camera confused angles, a blade script, and cheap background music make this movie absolutely unbearable. I have rented this flop with low expectations .... but. ... well ... even sucked.
