There were some scary scenes, which I always liked more than gore, but otherwise this film was pretty weak. There were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still quite unclear. After watching this movie, it still seemed to me lost in many ways. He remembered Silent Hill a few years ago. The film was also unsatisfactory, but better than trying to work and the story really made sense. This, not so much. The act mostly for Abandoned was decent, but the movie dragged on one, and never really gave any satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise this movie was a mess. I'm sorry, I can not recommend it.
