I've never seen this movie, but I can tell you something about its production. While a comedy / oldies DJ in 1988, I got a phone call from the production company. They asked if I was writing and recording a bit that it would have fallen into the soundtrack as sounds eminent from a television (the television screen would never have been shown). I have certainly said that he wrote a parody of the monsters of science fiction in the 1950s, rounded off some sound effects, and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. As she was in the air, she put a long song, joined me at the production hall's microphone, and cut the soundtrack in one shot. Whispering, she returned to the show as I blended into sound effects. We would never have done it if we knew that the "Wood Massacre" would be such a turkey - but again, we never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
