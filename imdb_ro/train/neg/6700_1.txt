Is there a more intolerant and more critical movement than the ecological movement? A young socialist youngster who joins the circus must look so intimidating that he will unite with a true circus. Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues, Hollywood teachings may often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. Here you will learn the art of turning your finger in front of anyone without losing your stunning trademarks. You will learn how to lift logic and science with strong arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that you are not interested in by tagging it as the gateway to Armageddon. In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face, you will also find out how to mistakenly raise the accusations that are deflected, no matter how much you are a hypocrite. You can use as much energy as Al Gore, while people will treat you as if you were Amish. In the second season it was even more useful, because we were able to visit other Hollywood gods, sanctify your names and judges - that is, judges - their lifestyle. NOTE: this is the only time when an envirofascist is fit to judge someone else because it allows the victim to have the chance to buy all kinds of expensive and fashionable toys so he can give his finger to the faces of others. <br /> <br /> What did Ed bring us into season three? Perhaps he will teach us how to be judges during sleep!
