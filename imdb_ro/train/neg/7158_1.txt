These are some of the worst actions I've ever seen. I like Nadja Almereyda, but that's just an absolute problem. Apart from a few moments of cinematography and interesting music, this film is just a material that does not work badly and contains nothing. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this case is at all good. Crying is a joke, but not like haha. I do not even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please delete the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and another girl a different planet?
