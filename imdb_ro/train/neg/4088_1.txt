This was a fairytale event in my life-watching movie. I went to see this in the theater when she left. I was completely amazed at how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owes a favor - a very, very great favor. The special effects are absolute first class, just as any first-class student could have done. Rubber toy strings on strings without trying to hide the rows, the arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look like the shape of an arrow that you will find on a street sign and a ridiculous story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest." Every film student should only see this so that they even know the definition of a bad movie.
