The legal gray area concept in love crimes contributes to about 10% of the film appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to its flagrant mistake. To say that Sean Young's performance as the so-called district lawyer is wood is a gross underestimation. With her gentle costumes and unnecessary hair gel, Young makes a decent job to convince the audience of devoted hatred for men. Why would anyone have asked her only friend to stand up as a prostitute just to arrest the cops trying to take them? This hate is also the only reason why she is pursuing relentlessly a perverse photographer who gives women a consensual emotion and driving force behind this terrible movie. Watching young people from frigid nudity to full-frontal only increases interest, but the temperament of the temper he throws near a fire by a lake makes. Looking at her turn and raves about her self-healing and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee, but it's all coming down to and from there. In spite of his desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, her police abilities totally get rid of her in the heart of tired desire and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent job as a thin sociopath; if he worked in Sleeping With the Enemy, sure hell might work on it. But I can not help wondering if Young's lack of energy brings the film's conflicts with his weakness. I think it happens and the result is a "thriller" with emotions that are very bad and yet comic.
