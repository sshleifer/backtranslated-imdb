The following are some of the biggest problems with this movie: 1) Clich√©s abounds. Seriously, terrible "twists and turns" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps around time, which would be good if it did well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) that does not develop so much that it stays totally static or changes drastically for no good reason. 4) Great One: HORRIBLE ACTING. Above the top of almost every person. The following are some of the best points in the movie: 1) Lead is damn well. While I see, there are only two types of people that would be in this movie: a) People who can stay in 90 minutes as if just because lead is attractive. b) People who often think of themselves "I like that Hollywood squeaks and goes by, but if I can only see it in Korean ..." There are a lot of Korean cinemas there, so why have you scrubbed your garbage time?
