If there had been a star rating of 0, I would happily convey this pile of absolutely horrible waste. The fact that the actual summary is perfect and that if it had done differently it could have been brilliant just doing it worse. The basic task of blocking a group of people in an experimental room is fine, but WHEREES THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of surfer and unintelligent blondes talking about music and culture that they do not know or want to know ... Challenges are pathetic and foolish. The purpose of TV reality is to show REALITY. If you set a "challenge," do not make them play with exaggerated props and stereotypical cultural elements in "morning gaming". to make them a real challenge. And in terms of "winning" the prize, that's good if they won it! These people are nuts. If only they did the show better, the real idea would be glorious. But that will not happen!
