(Note: I thought I would be the only one to write what I did below, but I see the others here that I agree, I think it was quite obvious - this was exaggerated with the bait. ) Owners went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) alone and locked in the house. This does not mean milk, but the cat, for his relief, finds a bunch of canned tuna. However, to his discontent, he can not find the opener. Looks like the little mouse in the house has ... and hits him with the cat. This is a rodent who continues to tease Sylvester with the opening and then shake it in the last second. Sylvester tries everything to open the box but he can not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and why they make the sadic mouse, the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like Tom & Jerry's few cartoons where Tom always gets the worst, though often the little mouse starts the conflict!
