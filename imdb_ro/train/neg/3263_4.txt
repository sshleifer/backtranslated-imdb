This is the second British film to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham. The whole story of the Quartet, with the exception of one story, does not work well in the contemporary era; and the actors' discourse is decisive "cut", as can be the distribution of British actors before the 1950s. In any case, "Trio" seems closer and more film than the first adaptation of the film. One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. Consequently, until the 1950s, the story of Maughm (pre-war) storyteller "Little Morality" seemed rather strange, if not right.
