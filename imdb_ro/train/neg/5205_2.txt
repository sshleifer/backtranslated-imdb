Minimum scenario, minimal character development, minimum constant room. Extensive maximum scenes, headaches that cause jerky zombies, maximum walking characters around the wood do nothing. Until the time blinks on the screen at 12:01, you can hurry ahead and lose nothing because there are three hunters that we do not know about doing nothing. To be honest, the movie has a string music that was interesting, so maybe a video would have been the way to go with it. Unfortunately, it was not, and what was supposed to be twenty minutes short is stretched beyond faith. Forget about "Trigger Man," I know I'm trying to. - MERK
