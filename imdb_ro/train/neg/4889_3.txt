The line is more fun in England, where, far from Vixen's native America, the word "fanny" has a whole new meaning. Unfortunately, it's the only laugh you get in this terrible sexual comedy, which is neither sexy nor amusing. Erica Gavin (the ability to act: zero) is a nymph who appeals to his brother but rejects his black boyfriend, while making disturbing observations about the melon. Like revenge, she asks her if she will go with a Shetland pony. Also referred to as "dealing with monkeys". Gavin's ability to shake and shake with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch suits her only in the absence of her seductive dance appeal? which involves a fire of fire and an egg-tree. Personally, I preferred eglephin. For '68 this was a rather daring thing and contradicts the controversy it attracted at the time. A character claims to be "stoned", although it is only on the bourbon, and for one of the original "X" certificates there is no full frontal nudity. Only six years later, we would have captured Timmy Leah and his Confessions, but here we have to deal with topless pictures. Only Gavin's ultimate seduction of his brother is shocking. Another activity for Vixen is to help solve sexual problems between a married couple sleeping with both of them. The two women, obviously, are not happy to act together on stage and make a poor effort to hide it. After Vixen changes her disharmony, her romantic husband ends up with his wife, "I think she got to her!" The only segment to be seen is an unusual discussion of Cuban communism. Apparently it does not take place with the rest of the film, though it is scattered with frames of Gavin's breasts to tighten it continuously. This then leads to a vague anti-Vietnam position, which is commendable, although it fell in the midst of such a frivolous film, seems tribute and insensitive, not to say without taste. In fact, Commissioner Niles Brooke's side is taken by Harrison Page, the same Harrison Page starring Captain Trunk in the funny comedy Sledge Hammer! The page must be embarrassed by its back catalog (including Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls), although Meyer apologists will believe that terrible dialogue, stupid action, unwanted direction, and gross editing are not just a part of intentional charm . As a defense, he fails to have water. Irritating incidental music? a cross between the songs he plays in the movie ads and the music used by the TV stations when the broadcast decomposes? is omnipresent and intrusive; while even slow, camouflaged, amateur angles can not generate interest. A wonderful world of jazz saxophones, where women "ask", black men? or "shines"? are not good enough for anyone, and rape is an acceptable form of revenge. Absolutely abisal.
