What a waste of time! I've been trying to stay through "Sky Captain ..." about 6 times and every time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - something else! It's a boring film, the act is terrible, boring writing, and obviously a director for the first time, because it's rigid and I wanted to love it, I like SF, the old cliffhangers, and appreciate trying to block Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God. I worked for Paramount Pictures and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using the blue screen for on-screen tests, told me he would never have any interest or need to do that. 10 years later , the Paramount Sherry versions were right in 1993, but they must have forgotten their own advice when it lit the dog. The blue screen shot an effect, but not a whole movie Let's not forget that neither Jude nor Jolie are terrible actors from the eyes), Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort, too bad - he could have worked, but only under a qualified director. the funny thing is that the Sky Captain will continue to work even after this game. It's trade, not art!
