Can the fake landscape destroy an image? You would not believe that, but actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of movies in the classical era and I know pretty much what else, like drivers driving real estate in front of a screen etc. But a lot of hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have fake landscapes, the fallen mountains and flowers that shot after shooting, as seen in the Brigadoon, become insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> As far as musical fun is concerned, it is always subjective. What songs one likes, another may not be an important part of judging a movie (if someone likes songs). I could exploit this movie for songs, dances, romance and characters in the 1950s, but that was the 1950s and a lot of people liked this kind of thing. The musicals did very well in the 1950s. I liked the '30s and' 40s with great cocks. Until the 1950s, these new things - which they can stay - were removed. Does that make a bad movie? Not. She does just one that I did not care too much about. Despite the good distribution, good director and great expectations, this movie has bombed at the box office and with me. I should have liked it more, being a dreamer and that's a nice part of this story. I'm not the cynical guy and a beautiful city and cute people that make me feel good sounds a terrible call. Then why could not I connect with this movie? Part of it was the dance. I do not care about the stuff that replaced the dance on the tap. But - no - the thing really stopped me. There is not Scotland, nor the high areas, just a background of hockey to make it look like this and made it almost from the beginning. Score a point for realism today if they "go to the place" most of the time.
