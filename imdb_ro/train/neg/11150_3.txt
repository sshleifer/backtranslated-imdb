I looked at this film alone in the dark, and it was a full moon! I did not do it for purpose, so that's how it happened. So all the elements were there for this movie to scare my fuck! Well, he did not really want to close the DVD player after just 8 minutes, but I thought he gave her a chance, unfortunately we did. The act was terrible, the only one with a decent attitude was Samaire Armstrong. Plot is not original, if you are a horror fan, then it's just the same things you've seen many times before. Some scenes make no sense, and you just felt that the director wanted to make the movie more! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. The scary scenes seemed to belong to a horror movie of the 80s, when there was not enough technology, yet some good movies were made then! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie, I thought it could not put some money in it and make it decent! I could not agree with the ratings that the film got, it's also my ranking for it, 3 out of 10.
