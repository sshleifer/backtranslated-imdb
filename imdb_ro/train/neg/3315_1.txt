Bah. Another tiring, desolate work of a work that was not created to be filmed. In addition, Toni Collette is gorgeous as always (being a real actress, you see) and there are some nice manipulated cutover handover between scenes. There are even a few really funny lines, and filming, scoring and editing are competent, besides a bizarre voice and talking to the end of the room. But, ah, but. Much of the distribution appears to be on the autopilot and they are almost all very clearly too old (and in a too young case) for their stated ages. Worse, they spoke exactly "Austin," that falsetto that sang the only song that could not be further from the way people spoke on Austen's day (think like Yosemite Sam, you're not bored). This is particularly sad, since, finally, we are finally able to see the death of the "fakepearer" as scary as that Olivier and his friends were so in love with crying at the top their lungs. everything is Gwyneth Paltrow. She played only one character in her films, and she remains true to form here, smirking to sulking in the first ten minutes, then repeating itself for the rest of the long-lasting film. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why she would be interested in her outside. In short, there are very few reasons to watch Emma. It's a good amicable adaptation, but if you want to pack a movie full of anachronisms (that is, a seemingly thin lead that can not draw an arc or that has a regular accent), then you'd better do it right, as well with extremely superior "Clueless".
