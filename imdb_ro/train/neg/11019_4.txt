Fred Olen Ray is a bad director, even as far as film directors B is concerned, but "Haunting Fear" is probably one of his best movies. Yeah, eating the big Poe story "Premature Burial" and yes, it's wrong and irregular all the way, but it's also quite fun. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a beautiful housewife, whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) plans to eliminate him because he needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core movies in the 1990s, actually offers the best movie performance as a mistress mistress. You will also enjoy the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a beautiful cameo in one of the best scenes. The end did not make much sense!
