Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. It's my second favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine." /> <br /> Let's start with good. Teaser, it was incredibly well done and emotionally. Being the great lover of animals that are, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. But then I am all bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. Made little sense, so these animals were kidnapped by strangers and were impregnated? whaaa ??? the dialogue was also quite terrible. There were about one or two quoted lines. <br /> <br /> And, worst of all, dying was very unpleasant to me. Finally ... what is the purpose? they all died. I did not learn anything, I was not entertained, and I could not find sad Sophia's death ... very frustrating. shame because Season 2 was doing so well.
