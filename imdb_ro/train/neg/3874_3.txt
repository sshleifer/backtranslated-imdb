This movie was so predictable that all the time you hoped the obvious suspect was innocent and there was another turn. Still ... no. He continues to act creepy and continues to ignore it. Did Mary find very incriminating evidence in his place and still trust him? And what was the "trap bait"? There was no trap. She confronted him, said, "Excuse me, I have to go kill somebody." He left, and that was the end. They try to use other suspects (like an old carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the setting is simply weird ... that is stuck in a recycling plant? Failed and nothing is well developed. For example: When he leaves his place after taking the beer, he finds the pictures and ends and catches it and gets sex in the car ... what was that? Her reactions were not portrayed. In the car, she was scared as if she could be practically rape, but then all we see is to blow them up the next morning. booooooooo It could have been a lot better .. much better.
