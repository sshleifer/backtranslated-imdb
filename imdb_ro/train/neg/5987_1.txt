I did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. A typical American plot, I'm sorry. The guy gets the girl type at the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is! "I still liked Tracy and Thunderbirds. And the British were bad? (except for Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to that? Oh and they continued to say things like "Here's Thunderbirds" - but it's never been known as "The Thunderbirds" in the series, why not? I would like to see that this was done again in 20 years with more British films. I preferred the original series. We're sorry!
