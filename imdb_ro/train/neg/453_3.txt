Okay, first of all: Cher's performance and cinema. Although I am not a Cher fan, it offers excellent performance and her part has been well written. The cinema was well made and captures a sense of romance. The rest: a thin line, Nicholas Cage's performance and a totally unmoral and poor attempt to describe an Italian-American family in New York. First of all, every time Cage opened his mouth, I cracked. I do not know what accent she tried to use. Frankly, sure, there was no New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And not because I'm a man of accuracy, his voice just stitched in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other shows. Secondly, this is simply anecdotal, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and I sincerely laughed and felt more joy regarding the appreciation of the far-fetched Italian ethnic family than this movie. And that would be a boring night at home. What he got down.
