I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a salary cut, Warner Bros. she avenged herself by dropping her into inferior projects for the rest of her contract. She decided to take the money. But her career has suffered accordingly. That might explain what he does in Comet Over Broadway. (Although it does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it, too). "Ludicrous" is the word others used to plot this film, and that's on the target. The killing process. Her career full of voivode. Her success in London. Her final scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. The sets and costumes also looked like things in the movie B. And her hair! Turner shows you many and many movies this month. Watch ALL OTHER and you will do a favor.
