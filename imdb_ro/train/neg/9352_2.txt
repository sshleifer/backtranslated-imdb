You can often say that a movie did not prove as it should have been for a narrator's heavy use. This movie presents this device all the way. Richard Jobson is not entirely happy to write directly and even finance some of the movie adds to his credits by reading some extracts from his own semi-autobiographical writing which, combined with some pretty successful editions, jokes over what's a story the boring depressing he has to cheat for the authentic art house. Kevin McKidd brings good performance. Everyone else is okay. Budgetary constraints meant that all scenes are shot in the light of the day, though most are obviously intended to be at night, although if you know serious alcohol, they work mainly on this day, so for me there is a touch of realism . The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to aged one day in the twenty-one strange years that have passed between her appearances - a more extreme version of the McKidd problem that goes from 18 to 30 without change more than clothes. Bless.
