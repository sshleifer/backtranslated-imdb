This granular film has a trace of worship and one of those features you just had to see. Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, who knows the legend is true. This story is narrated in a documentary style by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places, talking to real people involved. The legend is changing with the story, but in the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, the surrounding area of ​​Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek. The long three-finger length and raised over 7 feet high, this damaging creature periodically caused damage and scared "bejeebers" from most of the community. I passed personally over Boggy Creek Bridge in 1974 and gave the hair behind my neck. Of course it was around 1 a.m. in the rain. When I got to Shreveport, I was laughing.
