This film is worth more than 1. But I give it one because so many leaf fan boys gave it 10 and got a rating that will take it in the top 100. Seriously, it's not so great it's not so bad. It's a classic stupid cult, with so many leaf fan boys, it's ridiculous. These are the types that probably laugh at Chuck Norris's jokes and still say, "I'm Rick James b! Tch" No matter how old or annoying it gets. I'm afraid they've heard that "I'm sick of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" for months now, from idiots trying to be funny. His crappy working carp, etc. It's good to love a bad movie, but you still have to recognize a bad movie. Wait for Marine to play John Cena if you want to see a true movie
