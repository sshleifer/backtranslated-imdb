First some backgrounds; I am English and have lived in London for all my life. I've been to many games at "The Den" and most other clubs in London. I'm familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know how he works and how he talks. I have to say this is a bad and bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie with embarrassment. I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I had to point out a few things. A) People just do not talk like that in London in real life; movie makers have taken all the silver too far and made it stupid. Unfortunately, there are types of hooligan, but the ones you see on Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately called "English" or "Cockney" like Osama Bin Laden. It's from North to Newcastle and I am surprised that any of the other actors could keep their right side acting with him - how should we take it seriously. Why did not they get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I could have done a job, I, hehe. c) Mr. Frodo. I want to say where I can expect to take Elijah Wood seriously by hitting his ass twice that size and who are real hooligans. He would be dead. Just like that. Frankly (as a British) it was hard to watch this movie. I'm sure this movie will bomb here in the UK. It could do a little better in states because Americans just do not know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not think a word of these nonsense. Yes, these firms exist, but everything is extremely underground and silent, and on a much smaller scale. The movie gets only 2 from me, because they actually shot something in London. They usually try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and they expect them not to notice.
