Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a horrible movie. Very scripted, overstretched, and simply stupid. That being said ... is actually a pleasant film at a certain level. This film wanted to be watched in a group with a large amount of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, the Hunter of the Future" ... so bad he's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a blast to watch. It's shit. It's fun. It has a theme of Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, however, look elsewhere. 3/10. BTW, I heard rumors that a studio is studying the possibility of a remake ...
