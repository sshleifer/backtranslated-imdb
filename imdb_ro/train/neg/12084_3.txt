Take a <br /> <br /> 1. A famous piece <br /> <br /> 2. A director with own ideas using it <br /> <br /> 3. A copy of the design scene a popular theatrical production of the piece mentioned in 1. 4. A leading actor - who has no sense of the role he plays And you will get: "Hamlet, Prinz von DÃ¤nemark" I listened to Hamlet Radio with Maximilian Schell like Hamlet and I were so disappointed. We hoped that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would have at least one body language to emphasize what he says - nothing. Then the set ... minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like it when it's pretty much on stage to clarify what the setting is and nothing more. Unfortunately, it's on a stage, in a theater. It will not work in a movie based on a piece that actually has credible settings. That idea for the set was copied from the theater production in which Schell sang the Hamlet already ... Let's say if that was the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell could get his side Hamlet anywhere in the first place and how it would have allowed anyone to play Hamlet the second time. If you have the option to watch any of the sixty Hamlet-based movies, do not look at it unless you are a masochist or indeed a hardcore or want to have fun with meaningless actors.
