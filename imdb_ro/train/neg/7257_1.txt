I was expecting a French musical B-Movie. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès have been super-stars of some of the smaller French films ever since. And it's in color! But I have a hallucination, in an incredible hour of pure mediocrity. The musical numbers are terrible, and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? This is just a succession of bad numbers one after another. The only very rare thing about that is the nudity of women. He was not familiar at the time. In fact, some numbers are just there to show us topless women. Add to mediocrity! And he's trying to find young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, in a small part as a musician in his first film. Good luck!
