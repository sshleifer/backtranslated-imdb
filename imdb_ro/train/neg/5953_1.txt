How's this been on TV for so long? It's terrible. It makes me want to shoot somebody. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie in the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than look at this nonsense. I remember seeing her when she first came out. I thought, hey, this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, crazy, ridiculously stupid was really. It was so bad I removed my pocket knife and got my hand at the table. Please, people, do not watch this and all the other real-time shows, they are garbage that spoils the networks and cancel quality programs that require thought to be created.
