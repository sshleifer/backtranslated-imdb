The way this film may lack so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is truly remarkable. An incredibly thin and uncomplicated plot, a profound ankle characterization / motivation and a very horrible soundtrack (replacing the noise with wide noise noises, replacing the original musical references of the original for digital accidents and noises.) Then there are original references to the original which are just "plastered" over the cracks ... Dreadful In a world where the bastard, the American heir returns to The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (sighing uncontrollably) and Alfie have profaned our screens soon , this is a proverbial biscuit, an executable nonsense. How ever Ellen Burstyn was involved is a great ... Fuck.
