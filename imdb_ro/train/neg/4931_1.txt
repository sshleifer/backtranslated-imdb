This time we get a psychotic toy maker called "Joe Petto" (to do it?), Which makes life, bad toys that kill people. He goes after the family who has the misfortune of simply living in the same house where he and his mute robot "Pino" (again, do it?) He lived. Easily the worst (and probably [last] last) of this semi - series, this and the previous shows as basic porn but sex and nudity. It's a kind of low-rent hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home movies. It is assumed that in 2000 they began to make a sixth chapter in the series but were abandoned and never completed. We all hope to stay that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 stars from **** <br /> <br />
