I was expecting something from "K-911", that is, it looked like a nice movie where I could enter. I've always loved dog movies. But it looks like it should have been Jame's, not Jerry Lee's. The intrigue was quite tormented, and the two love interests did not begin to have chemistry. Not to say that James seemed to have a total sexual vision in the movie, despite the fact that the writer did not go in that direction. James just checked me for more than half of the movie. Dogs were the real stars, and that's pretty sad that the actors were shining. So I'm glad I not only IMDb, who agrees it's a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize that his brother, Jim, was the talented, no offense, but not everyone can be their star brother. Do not you want Ashlee Simpson to get the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
