This movie has received a lot of play lately during the day, either on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks with the same name. The only reason you see it is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I have to say that Matt had more than a little time to play a higher teacher. If she were a woman, she would have made him play with MAMA for a big school! (Is it me, or does his daughter start to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical adolescent highjinx played by adults.
