If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a street ploy in New York or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you could believe Pat Boone as a juvenile offender on his uncle's Kentucky farm and you could enjoy this movie. This movie is so bad that it's not even a camp for a ruthless love story in the mid-1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood has made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman, not his wife, on the screen, before his release, that the public knows he will not sneeze Shirley Jones so you can not build any anticipation for "screen saver" of their love. It's like watching a western where the cowboys have no weapons. The story is useless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. April Love is found in the worst film casino, along with Ishtar and Plan 9 in outer space.
