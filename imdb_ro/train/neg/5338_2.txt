Elvis Presley plays an indigenous American ("Indian"), who has to defend his reservation from ugly businessmen. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make children. Fighting, fights and mutual "breakthrough" replace stereotypical expression "How"? Although he made makeup, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he had appeared in previous films; eventually, preparing for his famous "comeback." It could not have been because the script of this movie was something to get angry with. Joan Blondell tries to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in the "war paint" should be ashamed. The best song is "Stay Away" (in fact, "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song for the Dominic bull. There are some surrealistic scenes, but it never gets fast enough to succeed in this genre; however, "Stay Away, Joe" might offer some laughter if you are entitled to "mood". Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury - Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
