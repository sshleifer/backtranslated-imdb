I usually love lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is just the pits. Yes, the landscape and the buildings are beautiful and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a waste of time. Annamaria adds between suffocation and exaltation / penetration / exiting on any drug or drink is at hand, and Ella inexplicably puts this abominable behavior in the whole movie. At no time do we give any idea of ​​why it is so or why Annamaria is so depressed and withdrawn. If there had been at least one closure in (potentially romantic, I do not even know!), There would have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella "why do you love me?" Ella does not even recognize this. It is never clear if this is anything more than a lesbian on a boring journey with a straight woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the locals they encounter on the journey, which could have been lively and informative, is instead a payment, tiring and rather incomprehensible. There is a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was unintentional. Women travel to a two-seater Ford coupe with a medium-sized trunk. However, when they set up a camp, they have an enormous tent, beds, sleeping gear, and even a table, chair and writing machine! In addition, when a ferry is boarded, we see that piles of luggage, presumably of theirs, are supposed to be in the small trunk of Ford! <br /> <br /> And through the whole movie, we never see a gas station or wherever it would seem to have some place to buy gasoline. For the most part, they travel through countless miles of deserted desert. So where did they get the fuel? There may not be too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there is a lot that is better than that, and very few are worse. Leave it in the shelf.
