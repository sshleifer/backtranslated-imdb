All you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks great, it has a solid, reflective soundtrack of the late 1960s, and only a few of its characters are inappropriate. Once you have received this message, you can switch to another movie. Davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, when she takes her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantastic film of which she is the imaginary director - she does so by pushing her away and associating with an idealized actress beyond reason . A laughing couple and a genius art direction are the only things worth visiting here. The film is also interesting as a documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying bravado was something to overcome, but here is the only quality of his character. The connection of Schwartzman's family made it clear in this role; here he hopes to improve his election.
