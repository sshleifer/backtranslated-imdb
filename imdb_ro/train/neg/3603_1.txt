This movie sucks! Horror acts, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horror! Nothing redeems here for the hardest of fans of horror! A killer killer treats students at a college. People turn out to be dead on the hallways, but still the class continues like normal ??? After about a fourth body, I think it could allow students a break for a few days! LOL. This is as bad as people. This film should be presented as a means of torture for offenders. You were warned!
