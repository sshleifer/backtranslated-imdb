the only great thing about the film is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book through its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a fun popcorn movie, but instead I got horrible Roy Liotta, called "Turbulence." . The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it's not even the right title for the movie, it was not even a piece of "snake" or "plane" in 40 minutes in the movie! What fake advertising! If it had not been for his title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable B-quality summer movie. And rating R? It must be the most undesired R rated movie ever! Movie makers add just a few words f to do it R, All violence is kept at level pg-13. Do you know what is really rated? The R superstar R! See him at Summerslam instead of scrambling money on a snake!
