First of all, what's good in the movie? A few beautiful actresses? the exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh as they act (would I be if I were in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: a Catholic priest doing abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his younger brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there's nothing here to learn or think a bit about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of the "profile" (series) with incredible replacement actors and coincidences (uncle is the cop who, the little girl living in the house of another victim, could have a child with the priest etc., etc. ).
