This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot does not make any sense. A scientist working at the edge of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe hell) and his daughter becomes aspirated through it or something like that, then one day for no obvious reason she returns and now has big breasts (I think the demons of the other dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she's gay, so obviously she's more interested in her girlfriend they are new and fall in love with this witch (they want to be a witch or something ???) and the spell of wickedness ends being read again, which is how the evil demon comes to earth that only the top bikini girl and the stray guy in love can stop apparently. There are groundless scenes without reason and a guy in which my friend says he is a well-known fighter, but his part is completely useless, obviously they have done something just to put it in because the fighters fans can actually watch this unnecessary movie. I'm sure topless girls do not hurt. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might explain what's going on, but it actually made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a "go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster" movie, but there are a lot of things (like the other size and the card vendor). I did not like the movie, but it was just five dollars so big. I do not recommend watching her, though it was too bad, I can not think of any part of the movie that was good.
