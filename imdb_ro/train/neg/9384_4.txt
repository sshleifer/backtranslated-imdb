Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the face whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit in the same year ENEMY PUBLIC. It will not be remembered by this strange story about the little girl hood who finds that her past will always be with her. In some respects, this seems a bit antique for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the famous NEW YORK LIGHTS of 1928. But do not be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photo is still in big scenes, there are a lot of moves, which indicates the distraction of film players' attention in their settings. But, in competition with the quick things everyone seems to be doing at Warner's, this attempt to bring the tear-jerk's view of the woman does not work, and Mae Clarke is not the actress to make the effort.
