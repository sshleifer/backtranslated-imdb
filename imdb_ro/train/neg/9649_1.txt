Who was joking about this? It was too much in this movie that was hard to digest. Even when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) suddenly wants his father's death when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri) just to abandon him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who ever went through Heathrow in London knows that such a fÃªte would be impossible to pull and especially not an Indian. But film problems do not end there, the problem of the two great leaders (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) as rock stars on their dreams. I mean, I saw the success of getting to Susan Boyle (a UK woman who had made her dreams after the age of 50), but that was a rare case. It was very difficult for me to suspend my mistrust because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was badly conceived. They would not have cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men aged 40) around whom they were desperately trying to star at 20? Let's not talk about the most conscious actress on the screen today, Asin. This is the second film (I've seen) and it's just hopeless as an actress so conscious of showing that she is only concerned about looking good and voting for the camera rather than giving a good acting performance. It's hard to believe that she refused all the other film roles to play in this fluff and then be as fluffy as an actress, nothing to write at home at all. And to the end, the movie was dragged in a tedious way. There's nothing special about it, believe me, you'll predict every twisted thing that's going to happen in it.
