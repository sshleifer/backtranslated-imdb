I'm a little tattered on DARK ANGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" tribute to the biggest script to ever live - but there is so little "current" content that the movie itself is virtually useless. I can not really see what motivation or "point" of this movie is - because there is very little biographic information provided in the narrative - so those who do not know much about Bettie will not know much more after seeing DARK ANGEL either. The film chronicles Bettie's career in modeling slaves in recent years. Almost the entire film is composed of "re-enactments" of some of Bettie's most famous films and loops. These re-adoptions are literally 75% of the run-time movies and offer almost no insight into Bettie as a person. The film briefly touches on its legitimate short-lived activities and its subsequent decision to leave the "business" and become religious - but all of this is pretty much taken into account in long and withdrawn scenes of re-adoption. . <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is not a horrible film - it has no substance. The other problem is that the actress who plays Bettie does not look like her in a moment. The other thing that irritated me was that, although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the movie was a short shot shot in a zoo during the end credits. The film itself is obviously extremely low, but it does what can be set and matches the suit within its limits - so I do not care about myself. The act is quite woody and can not be amazed by everyone involved. In fact, the most memorable thing about the whole movie for me, he noticed during the credits that the actor who played the real name of Irving Klaw is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the distribution list. I can not say that I recommend this too much if you are not a true Bettiefile completist and you need to have something related to it. And if you are so bad - then you need to seek treatment ... 4/10
