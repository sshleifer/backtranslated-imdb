What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for repressing the genre of gangsters, bites more than he can chew with him. His use of modern noir movies to address the theme of a man who frees himself by swallowing his pride, being cute with his enemy and giving all his money, collapses on his face. When Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, apparently he leads Liotta pretty crazy to throw his head in the final stage. Why? Basically, you can not set up a mobster like the Liotta character who probably got to his post in life by displaying a kind of obvious ruthless behavior throughout the movie, only to bring him to suicide with nothing more than a merciful smile to Statham's character. Before someone starts to say I miss my point ... I'm not. I feel good? Discard the search for riches and find true happiness and inner peace. Be cute with your enemy and that will confuse him in self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and, in itself, it is not a bad premise for a story, though not very original. The problem is that Ritchie just does not have the talent to produce movies to take her. When even Guy Ritchie realizes this, he seems to get bored of the story and begins to introduce red herrings: The scene when Statham is beaten by a car - Why? Shooting scenes as Marvel comics animations ... again, why? There are so many lost threads and questions left unchanged at the end of the movie, you could get all 2001-ish about it and try to imagine them or just accept that there are no answers and every spectator will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the movie that she simply did not care. Frankly, the end could not come too soon, so I did not have to stand in front of this pretentious psychopath. A two-hour loss of my life.
