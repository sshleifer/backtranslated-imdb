Rarely I was so upset about top performance, as I was with Ali McGraw in this movie. God is boring or what? She says it all in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible that Ryan O'Neal, on the contrary, is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is not much story. It's rich, it's wooden, both have to sacrifice a lot for love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, whose name is named after his name, if you have not noticed the difference in the two of them that they have overcome in the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominations for this movie indicate that it had to be a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wood's father, but a nomination for his support? At least Ali did not win. I still think that Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it were from me, Katharine Ross would have been in several movies. She's definitely a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not cry even when I got sick, never seemed sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones showing he was about 15, and the score is good. But he is so old, he has a beard of a thousand kilometers, and sin is not so old he feels that.
