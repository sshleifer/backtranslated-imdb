I do not know why I took the time to review this movie. If you stay with him long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising? not. Finally, it ends after a rigid, formidable, predictable and acting dialogue. Interior scenes are so harshly lit you think if the camera was zoomed a millimeter further, you would see the klieg lights. The costumes, hair and sets are deceived, pressed and immaculate. Should we imagine that ordinary people lived so early in the 20th century in Arizona? Other peer review comparisons with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least that director is shattering his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. The HARD Gore Gore is a bomb that explodes free from the wood impersonations of bad boys with manicure nails. It is not like that?!? I can think Heston thought he'd done something worth doing with this movie. (He gets his gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he enrolled for this travesty. Do you want to see a movie about the end of the West as we know it, the end of the West as I have known? Look again at SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN. The last heavy men are a mockery of a West Obituary.
