Reasons to watch the movie: 1) Bo Derek, at 16, looks good and sometimes becomes naked. It does a good job playing immature beauty, uncertain 16 years old, actually <br /> <br /> 2) Many photos of a pretty Greek island <br /> <br /> 1 ) Peter Hooten turns into the worst performance by an actor since Brutus played Caeser's boyfriend in the "Roman Senate Process on March 15". He offers each line in a delightful baritone. Reduce the volume whenever it speaks. Preferably all the way down 2) Bo's fantasies are sad with sadness, especially today's standards. A few turns in the bathroom and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is more expensive than Bo's costume
