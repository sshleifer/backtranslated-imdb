The director, set up in chains and leather, warned the SF Frameline Film audience Friday evening that we were about to see an "experimental" movie. Experimental? Leave your camcorder in the back of the car, let the box rotate and edit in all unnecessary points. A pantyhose maneuver that does not start anywhere and does not take place. The free violence that opens the film led more than one patron in the Castro Theater. I would have left, too, but my friend-someone needed a trip home and this thing has to see even worse merde to the end. Until the lights appeared, the audience worsened considerably. Tepidal applause. Proforms of the director that seemed content to the product. Avoid this movie!
