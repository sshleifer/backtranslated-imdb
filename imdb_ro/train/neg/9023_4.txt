I watched anime, but I'm not a tough fan; and do not read the manga. I say this because many commentators who lyrically ask about this film seem to have that background. I have seen the "Stuffers," and although it is not a masterpiece of any imagination, it makes me pick up "Shinobi," especially since everyone seems to love her. Well, I saw it this afternoon, and I tried very hard to look. Yes, it is very beautiful - slow-moving water scenes, autumn leaves on the trees, and even the glittering CGI eye - majestic. I liked the hawk, the costumes, even some of the battle scenes, but in general this was boring as dirt. It seemed like someone would take "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are cross lovers and cast into the "X-Men" for a good measure. Two characters shared Wolverine's powers - the guy dressed in a bear suit had his claws, and the gray-haired guy had the ability to heal. Then you have a girl who has a poisonous kiss - that's Poison Ivy (from Batman). Why do I give these women such power? The poisonous girl shows her foot, then kisses you to death. Dude, it's a great power for you. And the other girl, she can create bugs from this yellow dust that she's rubbing her hands on. The other woman, one of the cross-lovers, has the power of a hypnotic vision. Wow. I managed to get to the end of the movie by quickly redirecting it and saw a much greater tragedy than I expected. Some people compare this to "Flying House" and "Hero". Do not make this mistake. They can share similar endings, but there are similarities. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced film producer. I would say we avoid this movie if you are not 12-18 years old.
