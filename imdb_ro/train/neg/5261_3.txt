I have read some of the other comments and I have to agree with those who have not finished. I thought it was going well until the end. He kept your mind running and then spitting. I do not know what happened in the last few minutes of the movie, except for a complete misery. It's like having no money to come up with a good end, so they improvised. First they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear when they had a guy talking about Zone 51 (which makes you think about the aliens), then after they went to shit. I figured the actors and the actress did well, but the script became sour. Anyway, if you watch this movie, be prepared to be disappointed at the end.
