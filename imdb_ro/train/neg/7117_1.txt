As the film begins, a narrator warns us that SCULLING SKULL is so frightening that it may die for fear - and if that happens, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think nobody died of afraid to see this movie, but a few would have died of boredom. SCULLING SKULL is a kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. Very poorly based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. After being installed in his house, he is tormented by a gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks, and finally a skull that rolls in the room and makes her scream very much. And, for her credit, actress Peggy Webber shouts pretty well. Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the culmination of the film. The plot is pretty transparent, let's say at least, and while the cast is actually good, the script is terrible and the movie so uninspired, you'll be ready to run screaming. True, work is about sixty-eight minutes long, but it feels a lot more. Add a really terrible print quality to that and you are there. There are movies that are so bad they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SKULL SCREAMING has some killers - but the movie hangs so long that I can not work more than an occasional chicot and until everything that's going to turn you over will come out of ennui. Had it not been on Peggy Webber's scream, it would be a safe cure for insomnia. Give him a wish. GFT, Amazon reviewer
