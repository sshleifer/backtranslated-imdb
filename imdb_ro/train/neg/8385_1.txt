Now I realized that, looking at this movie, I lost precious moments in my life, I will never come back again. The film is not just poor, weird. She reminded me of any black stereotypical sitcom ever made. I'm sorry to see this movie. Flixmedia considers a race problem, apparently "white people" does not like it because it has no white actors. Mate, I guess you'll find the reason why nobody liked it because it saw the dry paint is more fun and funny, then this pile of snoring.
