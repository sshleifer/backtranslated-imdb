I really tried to like this movie, but it did not work for me. I saw most of Kitamura's production and found it very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some wonderful sequences and quite a lot of creativity. However, these qualities are in the short-lived painful offer in Alive. Plot is cool if not all original and could have done for a pretty ace movie. Unfortunately, the rhythm is painfully slow and the movie takes an age to go before it reaches places that are quite predictable. The action is close to the job, with the cool final fight, and the previous one about OK. The oldest is also affected by the excessive work of the room, which makes it less coherent. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating in the dialogue, but the movie is still shooting badly. Characters are neither well-crafted nor well-crafted, and the setting and general color scheme are unusual and boring. The movie is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps the judicious use of the quick forward button can improve it. With about twenty minutes out of the running time, it could be a pretty decent thriller. But the full-length movie is boring. Just recommended to very stable fans and determine Kitumura.
