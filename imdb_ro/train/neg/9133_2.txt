This is strictly a revision of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. My television came to life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most commentators. <br /> <br /> The Moonlighting Moonlight Pilot is your "caveman meets fluffball," in which a heady-haired man with red blood is manipulating a wrong woman in realizing what she wants and needs. The premises on which the "spirit" scenario is based must have already been around around 1950. It also contains a sincere writing, as if Maddie demolished the furniture instead of shooting the bastard, strictly for the woman who needs masculine assistance is inexcusable. I often feel that Susan Faludi exaggerates to see the chauvinist male conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case, I am totally with her - BACKLASH's Lamp of Light has been stamped everywhere. <br /> <br /> In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all the serious fans of Bruce Willis: besides the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed on Willis. Both features show to what extent Willis's ability to play between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Rating (and a fan of Bruce Willis): 2 out of 10
