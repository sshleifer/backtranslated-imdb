just beneath the surface is what? a horrible movie is what. <br /> <br /> as other viewers have reasonably commented, the storm sequences are simply ridiculous. Cutting firewood already blown in the heavy rain? now he is intelligent. threat? hunch? sexual tension? for those who have read boring and contrived, boring and contrived and boring and exaggerated. I want to say thanks to God for the shower scene, but in retrospect I think the producers of the film, the misery realized they had to put something to make half of it worth. so it becomes yet another challenge. do a favor and give it a wish.
