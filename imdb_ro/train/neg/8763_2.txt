I thought I read somewhere that this was the last monogram production, but whether it is true or not does not matter, because if not, it should have. It is a morose business with the role of John Carradine with a gray hair in his hair to make himself an older scientist who experimented with the help of his young disciple (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life . Each time their subjects are resurrected, they seem to have a whitish face like marble, as they are mice bound to the lab table (big deal). Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after he died, and mutt gains an unusual ability to walk through the walls ghostly (wooooooooohhhh). That's about everything he wrote. For an ultra-cheap Quick Monogram, this, at least, actually uses a fictitious-schmancy lab configuration than is usually allocated. The funniest joke in the film is that the "oldest" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when in fact Carradine was 40 years old and Shayne was 45 years old when they did that!
