I should explain why I gave this ... "a piece of art" with a rating of 10 stars. 10. Simply because it is hard or almost impossible to evaluate it impartially. probably would have been the same if he had given him 10/10 - explanations anyway. I'm not in love with these unnecessary gore films like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and cute (in all contextual ways possible), but as I found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historical drama" and probably would have been the case of 10/10, as Tarantino and he had been more than happy with him (and Kill Bill 3 made even more blood on the screen than here to show that may). but the thing about the genre "historical drama" is that it is a subcategory of "garbage films" in which John Romero is the one who does not rely on courage and thus can not automatically evaluate the film - that these are movies that are badly done for the purpose and you can not really tell if the bad comic moment was meant to be like this, or it was simply bad. it is for those who like to enjoy bad acting, bad screenplay and anything bad. And by a certain return of faith - and I am one of them. there are days when I have a desire to see a very bad movie and look for some trash and here go - the day is saved! but that's definitely my opinion and does not fit with anyone else. What I meant is that if you want to watch a terrible movie - then Fellini's Casanova is definitely the choice, but keep my advice and do not evaluate it by default.
