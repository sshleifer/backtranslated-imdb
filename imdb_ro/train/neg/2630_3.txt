SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams's life, I mean it would be great to find out why William was motivated or forced. I believe Secret Service members are people every day and there is a rumor that the writer is a member of the Secret Service, now the motives are clear, well-known. But as a rental movie this film will not satisfy you, it provokes the old but used breath, the media act - these are just things in this movie, just for you wait for the end. Clark Johnson as director of SWAT has done a much better work than at this moment and I still wonder how producers (like Michael Douglas) have left this movie at theaters.
