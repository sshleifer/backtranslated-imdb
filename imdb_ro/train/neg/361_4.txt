After reading the book, I liked the story. Watching the film, I was disappointed that many changes were made. It is understandable that books and films differ, but there were two different stories, only the name and some of the book's story remained. Read the book and you will have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better character development. These characters are extremely interesting and worrying about you. The locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters are not included. Television has produced so many books and microwave stories, this is a perfect example. Entry from the author does not always provide a good movie, but sometimes it can help.
