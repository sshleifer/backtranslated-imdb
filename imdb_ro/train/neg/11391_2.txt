When I started watching this movie, I was looking for subtle metaphors, but soon I realized that this movie was really about people in a train. Interactions between people are like what you can see any day on the street and when occasionally there is a slightly more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes unstable and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this movie tries to describe how people interact, but just that in this movie they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze such relationships, it would be better to get out and buy a train ticket and look at the train people with you. It's realistic, but you're not going to a movie to watch a movie about you sit there watching the movie.
