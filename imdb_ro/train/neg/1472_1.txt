I'm completely frightened to see that the average for this movie is 5.2 / 10. For what affects me, it's certainly one of the worst movies I've ever seen and still asks me why seen to the end. First of all, the plot is absolutely hopeless, and the really terrible action. I think any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; As for Mr. Kamar Del Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to stay in the "Valley of the Dolls". To summarize, it is a total waste of time (and I try to stay polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but since we can not give an O ....
