I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the great Dr. Uwe Boll visiting. The movie is simply very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad is actually fun" but simply bad. The complaint concerns a man who leads a terrible life (due to a seemingly past judicial record), can not get a job and a terrible wife of 900 pounds. This man returns to his uncle's cult leader in a plan to steal a cargo of toy trucks containing the avian influenza virus. Al Qaeda also has drawings on theft of toys, and what follows is just two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. The actor is terrible (except for Dave Foley, who really tries, despite all of them), jokes never rise above the children who are shot in the slow moving chest and the people who take a poo. It should be satira, but I'm not sure why. Think of "Airplane!" But made by South Park creators and no jokes.
