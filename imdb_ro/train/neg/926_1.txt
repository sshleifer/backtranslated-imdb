This film is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought from the dead to call Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn about an hour, is also called the Demonic. This adds the depth to the scenario and questions our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. Tyrann's spirit makes a small list of tasks (killing some people and saying repetitive expressions in Latin) by possessing the body of a college. He uses a magic control helmet to do this, which college boy willingly puts on his head, and then, at several points in the film, he goes down and returns. Maria performs oral sex on a Sean Willian Scott, a poor man, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green background lighting for no reason, and it seems to have been seated next to the CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries like this. The misfortune. This movie is empty and will hurt you. See this.
