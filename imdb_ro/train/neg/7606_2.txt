Beverly garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress before her time, bringing power and grace to even such chuckles as the Corman movies she played. In Gunslinger, she is the sheriff's wife. He gets off, so he takes over his job to follow his killers. It is better than the material with which it works, by far. The film is gray, stiff and especially boring. There is an (unintentional) humor with the tires all over, the people going behind a building suddenly come out in front of another (I hear of false faces but this is ridiculous!) And the really stupid line of the new widow the sheriff who falls in love with the guy hired to kill her. Even if he did not love his husband, it would have been just a week or two since he died! And finally he gets to kill somebody to death. He's not lucky with people, this one. <br /> <br /> The bastard of the play is another woman, the owner of the salon. She intends to buy a bunch of land only if the rail passes through it and makes it rich. Her plan of action, if she is not quite lame, will steal as much as possible from the city and be able to do so. Hell, it's just her and her gun ending up against an entire city. Are you telling me these people are not armed? Look at what happened in the old Old West cities when they came guilty of bank robbing the bank, then they were cut into hailstones by the armed and dangerous population of the city. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of useless talk and riding, scattered a few strokes. The conclusion is as bleak as usual in a move from Corman, though, thanks to his willingness, he lacks moral proselytism at the end that was in the Knowledge of the World. The sheriff turns his badge on Sam Bass and heads west, though the movie was so gray you never saw the sun.
