A truly spirited Canadian-German coproduction, the wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problematic child" - a few hours before the child's "action" killed her father and the mother fell for the descendants. Now she moved to the Northwest USA to get started, but her baby still has a problem by being dedicated to her mother. So really devoted to killing anyone who might be seen as a threat to their relationship. Sadly, Mandy Schaeffer (as a daughter) kills more than people - she offers such a terrible performance she also erases the movie, though the incoherent scenario, the unnecessary direction and frightening music (see the saxophone the first time she displays her point of bikini dressed) does not help anybody; we should find it sexy and frightening, but it does not succeed in both cases. Almost completely anxious and not bad enough to be funny (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer do not really believe as a mother and daughter), all the condolences of Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both of which are much more much more than that, and both (especially Rosanna) are the only wrong reasons for anyone to sit down through this farrago. One of the production companies is called International Quality Films - not from "Three-Hour Love," "Lies And Murder" (from two short productions) there was such a "you have to joke" credit.
