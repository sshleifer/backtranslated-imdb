and forget that. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna, the "Body of Evidence" rent, at least Willem Defoe is in that. <br /> <br /> In this movie, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to turn off the dialogue. You will not lose anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a proposal, and Madonna is so horrible, it becomes funny. Why did they have to butchestrate the original film in this mess, I will never know; I think they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, is certainly NOT. If you rent the original film from 1979, you will still enjoy it and the actors in it will be able to act. 1/10.
