I have always been a great fan of Woody Allen and will always be for most of what he has done in the past, but only a blind boyfriend could ignore how boring, meaningless, pretentious, and most horrifically done this movie It is. An absurd mental masturbation based on inconsistent motives. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a supposed "Clone Allen actor," put in Will Farrell's mouth and show what Allen would have done instead of Farrell, would have been 30 years younger. The result was obviously absurd. And not to talk about dialogues ... what philosophical thoughts were intended to be turned into an involuntary joke of intellectual thinking without knowing its comic effect. How sad...
