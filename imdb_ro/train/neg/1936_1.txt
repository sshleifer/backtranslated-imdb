The warning breaker. When the sister of the main character is pushed up the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka with her to make her seem to drink. But even before he was killed, he tells his business sister (Teri Garr) that he does not have a drink in four days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicological report! And the characters talk about being drunk when he fell down the stairs. It is not like that? Really mistaken mistake in this movie, which is quite terrible on the whole. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad, given the large distribution. Certain errors: writing is not very good, music is made for bad TV and there is no tension, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene in the movie.
