I saw the director "The Woman on the Beach" and I could not understand the good comments to the big ones. This movie is similar to one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic interest and even less interested in anyone else. Like his other films, you have to listen to empty dialogues, go through very few and be enchanted by characters that are rather uninteresting. If you feel like you like this movie, it does not let you stop. I like minimalism in movies, but I feel that Tsai Ming-Liang's movies are far superior. He has a rather terrible actor in Lee Kang-Sheng's film. There's nothing here. I want the UI to like it, but I do not know. Good.
