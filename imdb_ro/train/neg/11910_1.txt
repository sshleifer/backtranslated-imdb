What is interesting is that the act; it was not bad, it is not enough. It was pretty blade. The special effects and the lines were not the only guilty for this failure. Stand alone, they were not bad, but it was a tragic move. The show seemed long and failed, with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it did not completely fail. Much of the blame for this disaster has been put on special effects. You can not believe it, they were pretty cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although he should have chosen with little recognition of the fans. An experienced actress would have brought something to that side, as Appleby never did. Scphis takes some very good original movies, it's very bad that this has not been so drastic.
