This film is a fring-fest of bad action and a reduced design set, as well as sticky lines and a blade plot. But it's so fun to look at. Everything about him is hilarious. The core plot is a group of scientists from the future journey back in time to surprise their evil colleague who intends to destroy them all. Down with him in 1146. The futuristic laboratory of 2033 scientists is an eighty-eighteenth-style room with a bunch of "futuristic" buttons that light up and a time capsule that looks like a ship. Actors give their lines a tireless aplomb, which is not difficult to understand, as the lines are usually earth shakes like "I double checked everything twice!" Did he double-check everything twice? Has he checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you on the whole premise of the movie in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid fire rate until they hit the medieval side. When Roger Corman was out of money. And had to stop the journey through time and therefore different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they found, they used it. I think chain mail was not on the budget, because all the boys were wearing thin shirts wearing armor. Battle scenes are ridiculous, men accidentally throwing on cardboard swords, abandoning and dying in death, blowing with a blow. It sounds really terrible, but I like every time I watch it. Only the lines are enough to keep in mind and everything else is being drawn together to create a fabulous B movie, which, if you are a connoisseur of horn moves, I would suggest you see. And once you have, read the review of unknown movies. I like to hear all the good fun, really horrible in the movie.
