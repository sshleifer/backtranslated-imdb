What can I say. A film from Kamal Hassan being horrible. It works very well, but it's a horrible story alongside a horrible direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up on director. There are a lot of tragedies throughout the movie. Besides, one can not believe how real those terrible crimes were. There was no practice in the movie. Gautham has no more stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika behave very well. The bastards looked too ugly, though their performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie, like Padayappa, which you can see with your family. You will not sleep by seeing this movie! However, Harris Jayaraj again made a great job, and that's why I gave 4 out of 10. This song "Partha Modail Nallae" is soulful and soothing. Besides, great cinema. On the whole, this is just a bad and bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think he should have rejected this movie.
