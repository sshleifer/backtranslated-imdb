The film has several story lines that follow several different characters. Different lines of story do not feel like a complete piece, which makes this comedy very incoherent and even annoying to look at sometimes. Maybe it sounds weak and clich√©, but it's true; You better watch the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie. I'm sure both the cast and the team have had some great fun doing this movie, but the film does not give us the satisfaction of the audience. For a comedy, it's simply not funny, and Steve and Terri Irwin are not good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antique is not good enough to make a whole movie and their scene feels long, distracting and useless and even annoying at times. The film had little potential, that is, Steve Irwin is a character that in a strange way is so exciting and hilarious, because when I heard I was making a movie about the "crocodile hunter," my first reaction was; Brilliant! The film, however, suffers from its poor story and the incoherent lines of the story with uninteresting and unhappy characters. The film has a certain amount of entertainment, at least enough to make this film visible at least once, but I certainly would not recommend this movie. Watching this movie was felt as a waste of time. However, this film could be watched only once when it is on television, on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but story lines really completely destroy the movie and its potential. 4/10
