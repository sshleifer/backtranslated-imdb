I see where some people involved in this disaster have written reviews to share their part of the story and I thought that what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they essentially came with excuses - rewriting, budgetary constraints, production formations, etc. - simply highlights how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning are not personally targeted, but just a warning that this does not cut. It's traceable, but it's just that. There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue is ridiculous, and the end is telegraphed a mile away. The modest feature of a hologram that interacts with a recon team goes crazy in a stupid dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Do you want to hurt us a help from Hamburger Sally, let us be killed by these automatic sweepers? It seems that this elite team equipped with the latest gems and red arm moves from the red tube has no access to MREs. Once they reach the last rooms, they live more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting area. The reason for meeting with the fearful Rook is that it can not be killed alone. However, with only one scene, the hero who made this case abandoned the King to do just that. It is not like that? Vivian Woo was fascinating and grabbed the best character in the movie. But that does not say too much.
