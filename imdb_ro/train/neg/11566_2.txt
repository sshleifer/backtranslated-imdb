Perhaps I could not find the DVD menu for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default setting is OFF. When the final credits start to roll, I could not believe it was so. Like our poor, but beautiful, protagonist, I used to be used, dirty, inexpensive ... The characters were drawn in very wide strokes, and the writer's contempt for the rich Thatcherites was obvious. I consider myself "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would appreciate a little more subtlety. Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find meaning or message in this image. Unfortunately, not me. The only thing that prevented me from giving this a "1" was the beautiful, human landscape and plants.
