I walked in without knowing anything about this movie and I went out in half an hour to know everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They are generally a nice person, but if someone told me they liked this movie, I probably would never talk to them again. Anyone who likes it very much is most likely to have an extremely dry, shepherd-like personality. I will also include that they think they are smart enough, just like self-centered firepacks that make the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different kinds of humor, some people can not even like me, but it's okay; I do not think this covers any humor. This film is as full and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Go and get ready to get out; it is best to return your money.
