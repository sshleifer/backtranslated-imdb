Look, I liked PROPER Anchorman, but that was badly bad. A kind of evil that makes you want to get to that point in your life, a kind of evil that makes you believe "what on earth they thought about filming this first," the kind of evil that you make you want You took another 50 minutes when you went into the kitchen to take a snack during the movie, a kind of evil that makes the leper look fun, a kind of bad thing that makes you think you want to rent a movie Pauly Shore ... .Seriously, I can not explain how bad this was. After I said that ... there were some semi-funny laughs, but they are all so much less fun than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the whole subplot that was left from Anchorman who did it here was really left for good reason ... it was not even a good one. <br /> <br /> Do a favor (or in the United States, a favor) and do not look at this DVD ... it will affect the good movie that is Anchorman and you do not want to do that. > <br /> Well ... I'm fine now.
