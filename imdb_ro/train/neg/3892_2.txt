Want to watch a scary horror film? Then avoid this. There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. However, there is enough scotch. One malt if you can manage it. If previous comments were not enough to prevent you from watching this awesome movie, let me help you. NASA sends a man and two unpaid extracts into space to orbit Saturn. A strong flame of the sun makes Colonel Steve West bleed from his nose. Things go down from there, and the excitement appears. I actually read the adaptation of the book, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the movie, and the book was great. At least one claim is made against suspense, and an explanation of the events is removed from the author (rhymes with "gas"). I'm not saying the movie is completely worthless. Rick Baker found out that he should read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme found himself to be more appropriate to direct him. Yes, there is an MST3K episode presenting this movie, but it's, of course, edited quite a bit. Without mandatory intermittent breasts, not even the healing power of the scotch can save you. Please, just go watch the Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, with all my good conscience, recommend this movie to the passing film.
