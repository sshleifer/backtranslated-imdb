It's going to mix. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester should be 35. George C. Scott with brown hair looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! He squeaks and shakes, unpleasant and grim. He looks like a killer who sends his triangle to be sharp; we are not surprised to keep a wife in the house in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. In the novel there is enough darkness, but Rochester of Bronte is relatively young, athletic, strong and charming when choosing to be. He has a good voice to sing and play, a good mind and a consciousness that he is trying unsuccessfully to smother her.
