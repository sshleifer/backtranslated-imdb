Until the last few minutes of the movie, I would have given a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so terrible and "Hollywoodized," which completely undermines the first 80% of the film. The platoon revolves around a submarine and the possibility for them to receive an order to trigger their nuclear missiles. Captain Gene Hackman is about to launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of first confirmation of the launch orders. The problem is that to launch both the captain and the first officer must use the launch keys simultaneously. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington is firm, until finally it results in an armed insurer aboard the submarine. Eventually, the fault is discovered and missiles are not launched. Cold. However, here comes the part that simply does not sound true. After they returned to the ground and went to a review board, Washington and Hackman (who had just spent half of the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddies friends! Huh?! Too sad an end to make the movie worth the time for me.
