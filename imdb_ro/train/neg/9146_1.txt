Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a room. If he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for maltreatment. Anyone who pays even money to rent a garbage has to file a complaint and be compensated. This was my innocent first view of the "work" ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood looks great for me right now. When I return this shit to the video store, I personally ask for it to be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of homosexual cinema, I am excited and angered by the fact that this bloody man, very untouched, could distribute and pack something like that with a cute boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who fortunately does not has other credits acting in IMDb) and an interesting synoptic on the back used as a bait and then on the market as a rental movie. Believe me, this does not happen anywhere on any rack anywhere; it's simply not a movie in any sense of the word. An offensive, irresponsible, such as this, can only be detrimental to efforts to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those tempted to rent this because of the shirt, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to watch the movie while on the cover and appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, homosexual Mroavich provoked his own disgusting, worrying appearance of the boy's fur. This "thing" he "gathered" is a reverse project for Mraovici. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, put in the similar trash) are terrible in this respect. Mraovici deliberately presents himself as an absolute talent (in all areas), desperate to grasp whatever attention he can leave for himself. He must be merciful.
