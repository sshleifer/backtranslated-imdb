It seems everyone in this movie is channeling Woody Allen. They break and pause and crave more. Only for REALLY sons of DeNero! He tries to appear so nervous and artistic - but it looks like a very low budget movie made by students. The most commonly used word in the whole movie is "hum". The film does not make the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies. If you like movies where people talk CONSTANT one over the other, horrible illumination (even if it is for the sake of "art") and makes you feel like you are in a political blade meeting, then you like it - you have to to be really bored. I found this CD in the dollar box and now I know why.
