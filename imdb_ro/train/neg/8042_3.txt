The secret is ... this movie blows. Sorry, but he did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff, I know about what you've spent the last summer and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a spring trip. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun holiday. Then death begins. The first, then the other, then another friend, is killed, which leads to a sad and tricked climate, with predictable results. A note, Dorie Barton is Reese Witherspoon of the poor man, Reese shows, acts like Reese, and could go for Reese in a police line. Maybe they threw it away? However, decent cinema and the right cinematography have failed to offset terrible dialogue and writing.
