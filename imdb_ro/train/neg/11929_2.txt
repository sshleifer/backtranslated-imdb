I watched "The Eye" before watching this. I really liked the "Eye," this was one of the best movies of recent Asian horror cinema. So I chose this "Haunted Bangkok" because he was the same director, and he was quite popular here. But the man, what disappointment ... "Bangkok haunted" are three stories of love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are neither frightening, nor disturbing (as was the "eye") ... nothing. I can not fill even the 10 lines needed for this comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My Rata: 2/10
