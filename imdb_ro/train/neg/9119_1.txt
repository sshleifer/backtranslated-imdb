In fact, I saw this movie in the theater in its original version. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrassed so badly. The story was incredibly poor and difficult to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the strong ones fell. I will not say that I am a great fan of Peter Sellers, but I enjoyed the Pink Panther series very much and I felt she had a strong performance to be there. But this movie should never have done. From what I read, he chose to produce this film against the advice of the people around him. Okay, but that still does not excuse the studio by releasing the movie.
