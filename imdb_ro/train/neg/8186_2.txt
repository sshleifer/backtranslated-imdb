Somebody read the script. This must be one of the most serious writings and directories of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson, could not get him out. Almost two-thirds seemed like Giamatti's eyes saying that I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list of really bad Christmas movies. There are not enough lines, but what else can be said? Okay, the movie does not move with Vaughn's dialogue, his man is just a scary guy you just can not get through. It was just an unclear walk that no one seemed to be able to receive.
