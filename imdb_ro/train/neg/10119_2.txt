Animation in this re-imagination by Peter & the Wolf is great, but at 29 minutes, the movie is sleep induction. She should have called it "Peter and snails", because everything moves in the snail's rhythm. I could not even look at the film in one session - I had to look at it for 15 minutes and it was pure torture. Save yourself 30 minutes - do not look at this movie - and thank you. I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first minutes of the nominations. Unfortunately, to vote the winner in the category "Best Short Short Animation" (short!), Voters will have to deal with everything. I'm sorry for them - and I have to predict that there is no way that this movie will come close to winning.
