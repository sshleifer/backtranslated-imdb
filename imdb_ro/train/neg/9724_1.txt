Poor Hopper Drums. He directed a classic "horror" classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything she has done has been horrible. This is probably the worst ... and that says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) collapse ... or something like that. It's just an original idea (whoever remembers the "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything is wrong! Pathetic works (even Dourif!), Asinine scenario, production values, exquisite special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! You have to lose ... not even laugh.
