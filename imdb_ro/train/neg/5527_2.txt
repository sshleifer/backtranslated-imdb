Zombie rebellion is bad. There's nothing fun about the film remotely. It's boring, lifeless, badly acting and badly written. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a little sluggish for my taste, and it's good that this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute running time seemed 165 minutes. Story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find secrets of mind control through "zombification." A man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves to marry him. Once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to terrible consequences. That's it. That's the whole story. For most of the movie, I tried to figure out where I saw the masculine leadership. She looked so familiar. I've had enough time to think about it. Nothing happened in the movie. Even before the "zombies revolted," it struck me. It was Dean Jagger. I recently saw him as General White Christmas. That's how I 'enjoyed' the whole movie. I'm glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. The King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of the film compared to this film. For what it's worth, I'll give it 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10 because I believe it or not, I have seen it worse.)
