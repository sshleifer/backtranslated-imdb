This movie has the potential to be very good, as some of the plot elements are borrowed from the screenwriter THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives a kind of rebound to his roles. But someone somewhere really threw the ball on it. Dolph plays a monk (!) Who travels to New York to recover a key that unlocks a door under his monastery that has closed the antique for 2000 years. He has to fight with the minion, which is a jumping spirit, just like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion, of course, wants the key so that he can let the antichrist go out. Along the walk is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are watched by bodies possessed by minions. If you make this sound fun, forget it. Pacing is very strange and slow, in the best mode of action, and battle scenes unfold. Dolph sleeps through his role and scrolls through some of the worst dialogues in his career. The cheese factor really rises at the end when the minion struggles with a machine gun army carrying monks at the monastery, but the rest of the film is a snoozefest. Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
