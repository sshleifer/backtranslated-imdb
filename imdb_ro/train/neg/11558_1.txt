A terribly horrible story that I can barely put into words. The best part of the film was when one of the victims of the crimes showed up in the end, alive and well, just to be massacred again. There is a chance I missed some crucial plot items because I was in a slight coma while the child was on. The film box features scenes that are never present in the movie. I was lured by the brutal images of slavery torture and the promise of a "terrible movie Euro". I have the feeling that it was about the budget version and about a quarter of the film was left out. All good things more than likely. I got the addition of PG-13, which made just as much sense as the end of the new movie "The Planet of the Monkeys." Follow him with a friend and a bottle of harsh things. You will need it.
