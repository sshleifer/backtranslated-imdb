The fact that this film has made it all the way to rentrack in Norway is bizarre. This movie is terrible. This image quality is just a bit better than a cell phone, and the plot is very bad. The main character is simply annoying, and the rest just sucks. Every person affiliated to this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film to put their name on this is extraordinary. And distributors; have they seen it ?! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To label this comedy is an insult to humankind. I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
