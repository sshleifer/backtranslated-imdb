It seems that in Science Fiction you have this periodic throw to make a strange phenomenon appearing in long series serials. It's the place where the first novel (Dune, Ender's play) hits you with a revolutionary action story. The sequelae, however, take that universe and take you down the path of the garden to any new social or political comment the author wishes to do. The matrix is ​​ultimately the equivalent of the movie. Matrix is ​​exalted, alone, as an exciting film with a strange twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow standing there and wishing to explore other aspects of society, writers and directors lead you through what must be some of the most painful monochio and non-action sequences in SciFi. While the images remain as stunning as the first films, the new character explorations continue to collapse. Look for candy eyes, not for deep thought. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10, as registered by this beautiful site.
