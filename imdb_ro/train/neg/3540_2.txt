Guy Richie's third own film (without counting "The Swept Away") is a complex action thriller dealing with gambling, gangsters and chess. Jason Statham plays Jake, a former ex-con, who was avenged by Dorothy Macha (OTT Ray Liotta), but faces a few other opinions (one of which is Andre 3000 of Outkast's rap) ourselves and our audience, a series of red herring throughout the movie, all of which became extremely dull. The high point of this film disaster is the little one in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets in favor of a gorgeous shot, it's hit at the Sonata Moonlight Sonata in Beethoven, in general, Revolver is a miserable work, not really terrible, but far from Richie's best, which would still be Lock, Stock. the task at school would be classified "you have to try more!"
