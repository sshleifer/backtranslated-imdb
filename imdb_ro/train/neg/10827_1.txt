This ambitious film suffers most from the illusion of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson of grandeur. Much better material ("Nashville", Lumet's "Network"), this elephant takes too long to get anywhere. Several detours along the way (an embarrassing music interlude, a biblical plague) do not help. Even the unequal level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and story could easily be removed; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anxiety. And how many times should we see Shticul Sad Sad ("Chicago" and "Hours" by John C. Reilly)? Is Tom Cruise coming out of comparison? His misogyn, Saint Roller, was quite funny. Speaking of dirty mouths, the script was so loaded with "F" bombs, they lost their impact in the shortest time. You're not even talking about the terrible soundtrack, full of annoying and annoying voices by Aimee Mann. The expanded expansion of "One," a larger number to begin with, led me to distraction at the beginning of the film. I should have listened to the handwriting on the wall and rescue me for another three hours while I was pushed to the end of hell. A ransoming feature, which I have not mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the group by the unknown Melora Walters as Claudia, the affected hound son who doubts about self-destruction. Her credibility has far outstripped everyone else. This movie took too much seriously and did not know when to finish.
