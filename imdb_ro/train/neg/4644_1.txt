This movie is terrible. The story is about a woman who is trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, drawing from Noir / thriller to erotic, with horror elements thrown in a great deal. The film has a very confusing structure, for example with the frequent use of flashbacks without linking them into the story. The plot is underdeveloped, and the characterization has made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and what part they played. Some implausibility exists in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist voluntarily accompanies a virtual stranger in his home, then agrees to go up alone (where he says he will find a phone) minus the gun he brought with it , to call the police, it was too hard to believe. Some of the cinemas are very weak: we were looking at a 42 degree TV, so someone with a smaller set could find out what's happening in the scenes taken in the dark almost completely is beyond me. In general, a chaotic mess.
