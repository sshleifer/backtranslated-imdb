I remember watching this movie when I was young, but I could not remember the title, then go through horror movies, find it and think about me "that's the title?" This film is a kind of disaster / film attack film against insects with fewer notable stars in it. It's also somewhat boring because it has that TV vibrating towards it, where you can see that the movie fades for commercials and the like. The plot has this type of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by the construction or something that's happening nearby, but do not quote me about it. The most memorable ants attack for me in the whole movie was the first to involve the child who falls in the pool after it was rotated and, of course, the scenario of the Summers attack. What else is highlighted in this case is the very poor end, where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. Finally, though, like most television films, this movie is very tame and not very scary if you do not panic at the sight of the ants.
