I have seen this movie recently in a film festival. It is the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed who just came out of a large depression and a single middle-aged woman working in an employment office (INEM). I discovered the very simple and clich√© story, taking the "social" theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The main actor has done a good job, he seems to be an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working-class woman, she looks, she acts and speaks very much like a "high" woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays alone. She does it anyway in all her films. The whole scene of the movie was very poor. The photo is ugly, which is not good at the panoramic aspect ratio. Dialogue sounds often boring and boring. Comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not fun at all and are badly resolved. In my opinion, this film is not worth watching. Unless you really like Pereira's previous movies, you can enjoy it a little. Anyway, I went out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The movie maker was near the door. I wonder how a director feels when he sees someone who is leaving one of his films, especially one that is made to please everyone.
