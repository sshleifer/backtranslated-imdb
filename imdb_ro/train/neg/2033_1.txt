If I could give him less than 1. Do not bother to rent; if someone gives you DVD burn it up. This is the horrible movie. A total loss of "movie" even digital. I've seen better on YouTube made by 12-year-old boys. Lommel claims to have written this, if this is the case, this is a classic case of a person who is illiterate in two languages. The story line is none, the screaming dialogue, mainly room work is a kind of artistic fantasy attempt with the senseless cutting of jumps that are unrelated to the industrial transport scenes, or with a strange furious young tear . Usually I can follow a less than obvious plot or see the goal in a "creative" movie - I love David Lynch. This is either so far from the limited powers of understanding that I have lost or totally useless. I think this is a "let's see if we can get a title that will come out soon and make a strange rupture on it and see if we can get a share of the dollar" con job. can not see why Lionsgate even bothered this. Totally worthless, it is so bad that I will not hire someone else by the same director.
