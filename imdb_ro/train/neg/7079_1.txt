There's no reason to bother you to rent this movie. From the opening credits on, I knew I had problems. The movie was shot as if it were a soft porn, but there really is nothing erotic about it. Looking at the world of sexual addiction is interesting, but only at one point. The boring sexual scenes, bad scenes, and Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette's cameos are not enough to save this movie.
