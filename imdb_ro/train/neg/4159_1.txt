In this strange apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but nobody seems too worried about this Grade-Z movie, which looks less like Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. Bored companions run gas stations, and doctors still make home calls, and police officers continue to help with the radiator fluid only when you need it. Crying, and I use this term freely, involves a father and a daughter who is trying to revolt with the "general," whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to travel with father and daughter. I have to confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between great unintentional humor. The film also boasts a lot of nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. Whoever is most beaten.
