Movies like this are the original album-oriented rock, what music was - repetitive, boring and drained by all of the original energy by a corporate drones committee. I'm glad Aragorn was not printed as a psycho waiting by this P.O.S. Turn around and watch the 1971 version, count the things that NEVER are included in a modern version, and thank all the gods that you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls of writing and shooting an original film that was not based on someone else's ideas and was not passed through a corporate council before seeing the light of day.
