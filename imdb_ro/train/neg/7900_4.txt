The title creatures cause disaster in a small quiet desert town. This is basically the whole scenario of this movie and, while the scenes dedicated to the Munchies themselves are somewhat fun (in a very bad way), the rest is just filler and bad stuff. From the "hero", which is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the ultra-poor city policeman, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the movie. There were moments when almost everyone was on the screen together and I thought, "Okay, at least my girlfriend is nice, but why do we have to deal with the rest of those dead?" The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which she probably did in the early 1990s. (* 1/2)
