It is a real challenge to make a movie about a baby that is devoured by wild canines and the mother is wrongly accused of killing fun, but against all the chances she has managed. Meryl Streep offers the performance of her melodramatic, overwhelmed life, but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even when a mother struggles with the greatest horror. If dog comedic comedies are not your tea tea you might be uncomfortable about this and yes, it's a strange choice of subject for a hoax, but really very little of the movie has nothing to Do it with it because it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her accent Aussie quitting her face. <br /> <br /> Throwing into a slam with media bias and sensationalism and ignoring either truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the bold point that these things are bad.
