So he got to this. Fast and expensive machines, which only 1% of the top will ever drive. Girls who put them next to them in hood magazines. Level two and unnamed actors. Cheap promotional outings of people in niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the trash that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I like the mindless movement with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, it will be the Collective Braintrust that brings to light these things, please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a consistent "Woooooosaaaaaah", then withdraw your twenty-five years, and do you remember what made the good movies once? Then actually do some movies like this again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of pop-culture she has enjoyed over the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother now believe their Maverick (not that half of them will even get that reference). Some executives said, "Hey, what demographic do you want to run out of $ 9.50?" - I know, sir, the 18-35 market. "Okay, give them poker, girls and fast cars." - Brilliant idea, sir. The outcome? A movie I've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and most of all, with Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. The artistic footage above the top, like The English Patient, does not float my boat, but generic movies that should not even have been made directly on DVD disturbs me too. Only the teenage engines will have their engines reviewed, and I imagine that those at the top end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junky.
