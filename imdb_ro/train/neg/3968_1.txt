If you've ever seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compared it with the feedback it receives on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are false. TRUST ME: You'll be bored! People in the production team write their own feedback (sometimes they even recognize it). But that is not enough: I also constantly click "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the spies. The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad action, bad illumination, bad scenario, badly done. Trust me now! If not, you'll believe me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who still finance their films. (Okay, it's cheap, but nevertheless.) But, as a creative person, it's a complete failure.
