What this movie does is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more of the public's emotion than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with disjointed stories, frustrating pitfalls, and contradictory scenes, this movie has caused me primarily frustration and is hardly "the biggest monster ever". <br /> <br /> Let's start with good things: comedy, action and special effects. From the beginning, this movie begins with a fast and pungent rhythm. The opening scene - the origin of the monsters - is a fast-paced camp, paying tribute to classical "ecological" disasters that have given rise to many other monsters. Pacing is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often unnecessarily dramatic scene of monster movies and allows the film to jump straight into action. With 10 minutes you will get "why", "where" and "how" the beast and you are ready for action. This movie is delivered. After another short and well-shot sequence, the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his early child, grandfather and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, a monster. Characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly obvious, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly appears to harm the river where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster is great: alien, yet familiar - like a dog and fish swallowed by a squid. The effects of the creature are secondary, and although it seems weird, it's credible and you can not see strings at any point in the movie. Even the monster's movement was horribly known, like a rattweiler growing up and excited about the linoleum, the monster barrels through the crowd, sliding on the surfaces, crushing and eating that path. When the way of monsters intersects with the family and the tragedy provokes it, it really is a painful moment and you can feel the need for vengeance, but from there out, the movie starts to unleash. After the beginning of the dynamite, the film quickly lost focus and continuity. Draw lines are dropped, then the characters change their position for no apparent reason, and the comedy is interleaved in dramatic scenes with confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear apparently at random. <br /> <br /> As for the comedy, let me say this: I am willing to accept that a lot of humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things got lost in translation. However, as a major Asian student in college and someone who has lived in Japan over the last 5 years (still here) I would like to think I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average one. That being said, there were many parts of the movie that I understood to be funny, but for me they were not. SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack on the young daughter, funeral; everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension is even higher because it becomes obvious that the two brothers are in contradiction with each other. Both begin to regret their loss and to compete with each other over the one who suffers most. This competition is funny: two brothers who do not like others so much that they even compete at a funeral - shows the agitated nature of common familiar love in the Asian comedy. This subtle cock comedy, having fun with family fun and ritual mourning, should be funny, but it seemed like no place in the context of a lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot holes. there are so many points made in this movie, which are never explained, or, worse, they are explained and worried only to be impotent and useless in the end. Discovering an obstacle is not an obstacle may be a good thing for a character, but you expect a comment to this nature. Instead, the audience is embarrassed by moments of anti-climax when the problems are just "not there" and no one gives clues that it was ever a problem to start. So I wonder, why should you bring it first? <br /> <br /> This was predominantly through the movie because the problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the film is full of opposing forces that did not solve each other. Of course, introducing new and bigger problems is a time-tested story that tells the tradition, but if the introduction of a new arch leads to the forced shortening of another, you should expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was like getting more stories, each explaining only 20% of the way, and eventually the parties never converge to fill the whole. Again, I am willing to accept that many of these could be "cultural". Perhaps, in the Korean story of story, it puts the comedy into a tragedy. Perhaps it is normal for stories to go everywhere like a child that colors off the lines on each page, but never ends one. Perhaps it is okay to present a problem to develop the plot but then eliminate the problem randomly without an apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all distinctive signs of unwanted work and bad stories that appear in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
