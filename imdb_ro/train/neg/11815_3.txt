This operetta mini opetide with a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino script is so bad that it becomes an endurance exercise in five minutes. It is bad to go as this patent opens two soldiers discussing the lack of a mane into the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute he is studying in Morrocco, where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who would sing rather than fight. Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have luminous operatic voices (with little ability to act) and there is a decent bass there but acting is so haphazard scenes so badly prepared you get the feeling they do things while going together. This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. With more room for espionage and overturning, the show might have some entertainment value, but this quick reply is a bit more than an insult to an audience waiting for a characteristic presentation.
