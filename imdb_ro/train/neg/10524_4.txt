I intended to see this movie in the theater. It was actually sold. In fact, I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst movie to be released in 2002. Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a pharynx outlaw, the baby is shot, so he decides to go clean, and invest all the money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem pretty good until Jack misses the town with Trish's girlfriend (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so if they did not reveal this in the preview, it could have been an interesting turn. But they did, so it's not. In fact, there is no interesting thing about this movie; everything is given in the preview. If you've even seen a preview, you've seen the entire movie, so you might want to really think hard to fill the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is no surprise or overturn in the whole movie, other than how terrible the soundtrack is. I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of the music would be as if the only songs they would have allowed to be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan and (they can destroy the space-time continuum with a wonderful concept like that) had fewer talents and musical abilities. The actor is the best, the script is best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is best 67% sparkling pen and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Raises the rest of the play with his ability to act.
