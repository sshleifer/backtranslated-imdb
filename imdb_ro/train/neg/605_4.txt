I will keep this short film as it does not deserve a complete review. Given the setting, this movie could have been something special. It might have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project". The first 20 minutes of the movie I was very excited, directer did a decent job with cinema and suspense, although I do not think he managed to capture the true boldness of a London Underground. Characters were great disappointed. Our "heroine" in this movie is a piece of worthless stuff and you really do not care if it dies or not. As many people have said before, I rooted myself to homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chicot or two (whether they were intended by writers or not). The main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when it was revealed, I was very disappointed. I will not hurt, but only let me say that my 10-year-old sister could probably beat him in a fight. Everything is just another mediocre horror film that fits into the trap of the Hollywood Simple Formula. This movie had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark. Just to highlight how lame this film was, the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain. INSTEAD moves away.
