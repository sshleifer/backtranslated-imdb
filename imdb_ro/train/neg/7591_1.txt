This film is based on John Fante's novel. Could someone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adjusted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic production in Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how can you relate to Ask the Dust? "And if you wanted to turn the story into a movie, why would you want to turn it into a romantic melodramatic production in Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek?" I can not figure it out. Adapting the story is bad, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you do not like what Towne did with her. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, you'll probably find the weird casting, the bad role, and the cinema just a little troublesome. But hope for the best. We were really hoping for this movie. In fact, I wanted to be fine. But it gets worse and it's just as simple: whether you read Fantes' novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another melodramatic romantic production from Hollywood, combined with a bad action, lack of structure and - of course - lots of shots of naked Colin Farells. I could complain much more about this movie, time. I saw. OK. I had to see, because I liked it so much and I was curious. And I'm very disappointed. 1/10 is for sweet Colin the mustache at the end of the film. So sweet ... If he wore it all the time, I'd give her 2/10.
