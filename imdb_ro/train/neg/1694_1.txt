This movie may seem frightening in commercials, but the real movie was a reason to vomit. This is lower than average (even lower than this) and has no plot. I mean, every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead Japanese woman will scare you, but what? Make a movie to appeal to observers and not just show pictures of frightened men and hair (dead Japanese woman). Can you say "the horrible kidnapping of Samara"? Do not make me start with the "dead baby." Not even frightening! So what? He has a cat and can imitate it, a great deal! You just have to bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential to be injured by Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
