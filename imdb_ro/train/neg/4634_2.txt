obviously has some attached talent, Maria Bello is always great. but that's just a waste of time, portraying each character as someone who should be loose and exploited, so someone could make a movie of an "exciting" story. Well, I hope they came out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience, there is no understanding, no sensibility, no context, no humanity. which would be good, except that he has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to tell about the story he is trying to say. bad things happen, sit and watch, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" constitute an unintended warning to the public. it means that the director and the screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some of the events they have heard about somewhere, so he just throws them on the screen and expects the "true" nature of the story to make the audience feel something without someone doing anything To work. I hope they had a great opportunity to make this film. it's moving on ice.
