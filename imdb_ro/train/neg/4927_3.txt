Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary through cinema, wrote, directed, and produced other films on controversial subjects, but he may be the first to receive a broad view thanks to TCM. This film is her abortion indictment, but she cleverly cloaks the problem by bringing eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somewhat equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and other cinematic skills are well exposed here, but she can forgive her because she wants to use them less didactically. If you have asked what Tyrone Power has shown, Jr.'s "famous father", here's your chance. 1916 fashion and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this piece of museum. It is good even if you do not appreciate propaganda.
