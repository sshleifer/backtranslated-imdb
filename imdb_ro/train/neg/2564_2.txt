When I go to see movies, I will sit down and follow it or if I do not like it, I would lie down, but that was stupid, I just got up and got out! ... This was a bad scenario and put together, I hated him. They also did not have to take Brendan Frasier, he was much better. This was not as good as I expected, considering I liked George de Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, the bird, and when it collapsed in a tree. I hope the director takes into account, and the next films he makes, he has to reconsider ... horrible! I really would like to give Ursla a well-done job because she made the movie worthwhile (until I left) ... I generally give this movie 2 out of 10
