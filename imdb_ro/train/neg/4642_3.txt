I saw the "Rachel Bridge" thinking that I would go in a pleasant visceral walk. However, this was not the case. Visceral, yes, but nice? That would be a big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave her a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (as briefly) as one of the film's damn characters. As they brought Mr Hansen into this thing, I will never know. The story idea is interesting but badly executed. Direction is pedestrian, and the act is mediocre. The only thing worse than that is the special effects. Hopa !!! I've seen better effects in a classroom. Leave it, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear he's hiring Mel's Diner! There are very few, well-made, films that come out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
