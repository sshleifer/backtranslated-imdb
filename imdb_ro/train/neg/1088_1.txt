I have rarely witnessed such a waste of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of a movie. What little interesting things the movie seems to promise at first turns out to be less than red herrings. Stable actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - perform in roles that do not go anywhere; a genius director occasionally produces a film that seems to be filmed through a colored coffee lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything worthwhile, discovers new depths of sub-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous idea about it - but only at the level of the comments - is really part of aesthetics. Normally, I come to IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciated comments. This tremendous disaster of a movie just makes me want to produce an endless biliary line. I'm not going to do it, just because I do not want to take up my mind with this garbage.
