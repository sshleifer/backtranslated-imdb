No matter how you look at this movie, it's just terrible. If you see it as a horror, then it is a film that is inappropriate with monsters being hand puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice that most of the humor is collapsing and is just tormented. If it's a love story, you'll wonder why a guy would stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action you can not truly shoot for the whiny hero. As you can see this movie fails to deliver anything fun fun. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious dolls and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins movie. This, however, has the worst monsters of that genre. The critters seemed pretty good, as well as the Ghoulies, and even the puppets from Munchies seemed better than these. The characters in this movie are inaccessible. The hero is a security guard, his girlfriend always complains, has a friend with a tramp who has a military friend and another friend who is a lie. At some point in the movie, the hero and the military guy are fighting ramps ... this movie is absolutely stupid. I like the scene when it's in the expensive club of fear (which obviously is not a club, but probably a restaurant), and the hero tells the waitress that none of them have 21. Give me a break, I have 25 years and I look younger than any of them.
