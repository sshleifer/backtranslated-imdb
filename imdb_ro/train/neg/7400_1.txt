I've seen some pretty bad movies, and that's right there. No plot to talk about is one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera. I just wanted to tear her off because she just lets you say, she's very suspect throughout the movie. The monsters that ran around them, wearing gentle, were funny. I also saw a little of "Silent Hill" there. And I read that this was also done if I looked at a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So no wonder it did not make much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote the troops there and nothing more. The FX is very good, the aspect of the movie, the monsters and even the one who also acts good. But the story and the story are not there.
