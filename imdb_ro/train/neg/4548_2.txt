Boring. Minimum parcel. No character development. I entered this movie with great expectations from the book. It might have been a great movie. It may well become a classic cult. No, it was a giant overturned. It was poorly distributed and had special horrible effects. It was difficult to determine who was evil: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I'm still stuck with some of the movie thumbnails. I am amazed at some aspects of the so-called "prophecy," which is never fully explained. I felt I was looking at an episode of a mini-series on the SF channel. It seemed like a movie made for television. Do not visit this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
