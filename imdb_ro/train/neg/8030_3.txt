Not too keen on it. The story is pretty horrible and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, the banknotes are good. Then it was pretty horrible. Tim does not fit the role, he meets like a self-inflated foundation and Pruitt taylor vince is totally unconvincing as a trumpet player. It's an idealist film and as a musician, you feel slightly offended after seeing it. There are no scenes from 1900 that practice or play with his colleagues, he is completely indulgent. I find it hard to build a relationship with this character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you do not have a real passion for life or a sense of music that you can then happily enjoy in suspending mistrust and watching this waffle.
