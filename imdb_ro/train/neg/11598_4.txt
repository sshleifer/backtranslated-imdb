When you look back at another evil nightmare sequel like Freddy's Revenge, you have to give it a little confidence because you tried something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there is creative death, as usual, as a child who is part of a comic book and faces "Super Freddy," but even scenes of this kind are not used to their full potential, and the parties without Freddy's just boring. <br /> <br /> This marked the official death of the series scariness. Freddy seems to be the comedy relief now ... but what? My Rating: 4/10
