Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my friend told me it was the worst movie ever seen ... Since I thought it was really awful, it made me think - which movie was the worst movie that I've ever seen, and that's just the movie that came to my mind. Unfortunately, it has been a few years since I saw him, but I remember the horrible mischief of Dean Cain as an alienated military man (a pretty Cain boy does not make cocky very well). The strange CGI helicopter business, when it would probably be cheaper to rent a helicopter than to hire some CGI guys to succeed, but I assume they found the helicopter as a free sample for a CGI program or the producer's son liked to play with the new his computer. And how did it look like? Awful. And when the dragon acts through the corridors of the complex, then reuse the same photos over and over - it looks very cheap. Avoid this movie - it's really terrible ...
