What is it? is a mish-mash of recurrent bizarre motives (snails, Shirley Temple, swastika and racist music, among others), unlimited by any narrative or plot or character development. Everything impressed me as a "freak show" of myself and I do not mean only unusual casting decisions. He has the feeling of an acid journey, far beyond any level of drug use that Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs could attribute to him. The only film I can compare is Eraserhead (the second favorite film of all time), which was more depressing, but I still found what it is? a total loss of my time. It's one thing to give me a glimpse into the inner functioning of someone else's mind - even the chemically altered consciousness of someone else - but another to just throw some strange visions for me simply for the sake of strangeness.
