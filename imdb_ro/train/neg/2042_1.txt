Zombie Killer. 1 of 10. The worst action. They have never been the worst. David Hess (the last house on the left - not the one in the seventies - is very good) is the worst of bunches (fairly rigid competition, but amazingly awful God). to find a participant in the home movie with a strange presence of the room. The movie, in fact, gushes in a stunning overturn when it's on the screen. Not that the movie actually has a ransom quality for Mr. Hess to destroy him. It's filmed with a home-made camera and the look of pretty old stuff, complete with mike boom attached. No postproduction. Come on, there must be some sticks that you could use a five-year computer that could clean this picture. Throw into bizarre images of autopsy images and aircraft carriers and this is a cheated visual image. The autopsy images are intertwined in the way Italian cannibal movies interfere with those animal killings in real life. And the Navy movie should be an anti-war statement (Because we know that all the bloodbathing maniacs join Navy). What does the world do in the world, the Gate of the Lion, which releases this garbage? It would hurt Troma. The part is about the Zodiac killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry? Not the 70s. Hire it is very good) Someone is shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac killer? Uh-huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder, and where the younger old criminal's relationship resembles that of a Congress page and a congressional congressman? Yeah, the costumes and production figures in the eighties correspond to a Nambla subplot. Sign me up.
