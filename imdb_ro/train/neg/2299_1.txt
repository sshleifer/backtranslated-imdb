Before I start ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Kay now that's okay, I just want to say that what the world's damned people call "hosts" I think I'm doing? The last time I checked a host did not discriminate, complain hate filled with TV or try to push their own beliefs down the unfortunate soul venturing into the channel. On the other hand, that foolish, idiotic, conservative, biblical, Fred Phelps's lover, Pat Robertson, happens every day. I am all for free speech, but since it does this that covers a guy who says pretty much that if you give up the ideal way of life, are you immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many SOOOO problems. One day in my classroom I had a replacement teacher, so we decided to watch TV, because the lesson did not give us a job. And we (against the will of many of us) have watched the 700th Club and, of course, that bastard Pat was kidnapped and beaten about the Bible and he said Simon as he says, "God says that homosexuality is a sin," and I have heard actually a child go "Hmm I think he's right". WTF ??? Seriously, if the host tries to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin, then they have to seriously take that host, put them on the tape and throw them in a dish cruise in the middle of the Arctic.
