I watched horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen horror and bad movies, but this is undoubtedly the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Besides, it was just a gore. I can stomach a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stabbed in the back end and suffocated with his intestines! Stupid dog! Another problem with this movie is that it is boring and probably the slowest ever made. The end is just stupid. But, again, it goes with the rest! Finally, when the little girl moves away from the cannibal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she comes back to talk to her girl, the girl attacks her! It turned into a cannibal! Retarded film.
