.... because if I were, I would have liked to have been crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to figure out the plot of this movie - and I'm "generous" that it was just a plot for the beginning. As mentioned earlier, it's a bad name on the DVD's cover that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. He's just in the movie. And if he was really "frustrated" because the back cover indicated he was, well, probably because he said YES that he is in this disaster of a movie and could not get out of it! The film seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and his role in the film other than the closest was not as big as a mystery about Gene Barry's role - or not. And talking about "great" ... anyone who had the lighted idea of ​​fitting Gene Barry in Humpty Dumpty's coat, who presented his pants legally drawn to his chin, should be condemned in a tough time, looking at this movie with sobriety. I could continue on how horrible this movie was, from a dialogue that did not match the "actors" (think of Clutch Cargo), skip scene to scene (again, even generating even the appointment of image frames "scenes") in the absence of a plot ... However, if you are in the badties of the early 70s and if you are in a Michigan cabin with nothing but this movie and a box of pictures for children and cats , I recommend that you have a good bottle of wine before you embark on this strange walk of a movie because you will be grateful that you can not remember the next day!
