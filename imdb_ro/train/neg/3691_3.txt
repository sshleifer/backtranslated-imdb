I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant, first of all, but Baba was a great disappointment. Between a terrible story, the action and the songs were just mediocre. The story becomes very preaching. Instead of running for offices, such as NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to be Tamil Nadu's greatest guru. My wife tells me that since this movie came out, Rajni swore to make other movies! I was lucky to have originally bought a Babu (an old one by Sivajiganeshan) .... it was a great movie that he did because he bought this lobster ... except that it makes Baba look even worse by comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
