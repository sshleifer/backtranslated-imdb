Sometimes I enjoy really bad movies ... sometimes when people (even talented people) come together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it proves to be a disaster. Movies such as "Killer Tomato Attack", "Plan 9 in Cosmic Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate" etc. So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic," was considered by many to be the worst film of the decade, of course I wanted to see it. Boys, I regret this decision. This movie is beyond the bad ... it's so bad it's not as pleasant as the usual bad movie. Scenario of acting, filming, script, etc. is even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is completely horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "actor" is ridiculous ... it is a complete waste of all time and money. At least porn has porno to break monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy who squeezes a rotten apple and a "crazy" tea party. The light is non-existent. . many "scenes" take place in semi or full darkness, which is probably as good. The writer-director, David Tybor, tries to be mistaken for the scenes of slavery ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. There is nudity, but it is of such a poor quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressor. I could go on forever and not justify all the flaws and shortcomings of this really terrible film loss. For the love of God, avoid this wreck of the train. I know that, despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you might still be tempted to see if this piece of garbage is really as bad as I claim to be ... but believe me this is ... even worse than I said, and you will absolutely regret the positive experience (and expense if you lose your money in a purchase or rent).
