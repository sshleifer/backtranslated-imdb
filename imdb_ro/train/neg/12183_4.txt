Christ. A continuation of one of the most prolific films of all time, it has at least the decency to leave the songs (a half of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but it continues the tradition of being nauseous and unhappy. This time, Annie and her friends head for London and catch up with Joan Collins's plot to blow up the Buckingham Palace or such a shit. The film has a bizarre sicophantic attitude toward its eponymous character, despite being irritating: every time the little bugger calls "Leapin lizards"! I could feel my teeth grinding in the powder. As filmed, slid and ferocious, the movie has only a memorable line ("Unhand me, you genius stupid!") And the fact that it is not original to recommend it.
