We rented this film because it fits in the "romance" and "western" genres with some Grand Canyon landscapes thrown in. But if you expect a typical romantic vestvest, forget it. This movie is pure garbage! Romanticism is between a young man who has not even passed puberty and a middle-aged man! The child is also praised by other men. It's hard. Peter Fonda is portrayed as a virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is largely the one that follows the relationship. He tries to snatch it at first, but eventually he gets out and leaves as a happy and loving couple. It's revolting. I do not see how this movie could appeal to anyone except the pedophiles.
