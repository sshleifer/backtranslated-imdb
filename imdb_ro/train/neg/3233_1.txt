Good people, you can not be serious, another case of advertising, if it's not total! This is not even frightening, frightening or depraved - it's just a terrific amateur shot made for the next party to make the girls available. Gore is incredibly bad, even the eye - The script does not make me want to get tangled, just to make me want to take the room and hit the guys over my head. The girl is just there with rubber without moving at all. It would have been more fun to use a real doll. A season of "I'm a celebrity, get me out of here!" is more frightening than that. Do not waste your time or money.
