This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film starring Kevin Costner.) Chris Rock seemed very unpleasant throughout this film, and his actors did not even they looked like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful comedian stand-up, but he can not transfer his talent to this movie, which probably has only two laughs in the whole picture. If you did not watch this movie, still avoid a plague. Go make something constructive and more interesting, such as tracking the weather channel or watching dry paint on a brick wall. For Chris's efforts I give her 2/10! <br /> <br />
