There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not in touch with one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slow and very unlikely story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the movie sees Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to revenge her husband. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a guerrilla warfare and recruits a bad girl, Nichole Hiltz, as her choice weapon. He wants Nichole (as on Tuesday) to get close to her former (Stephan Jenkins, beautiful, but boring, who should stay with music) to tear it and ruin her life. David DeLuise is good in a few short moments, and former "Crime Story" star, Anthony Dennison, has nothing to do but slavery. Hiltz, on the other hand, triggers at different times, such as sexy and playful, then evil and deceptive. It also deals with vulnerable people and "maybe a little psychotic" well. It is also quite hot (though there is no naughty cheek show) so you can understand how it might be possible to get to whatever type of it is intended for. But performance is a kind of waste in this movie, which is not excited or exciting enough to recommend you.
