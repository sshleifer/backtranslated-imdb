Philip. The film by K. Dickian. And one decent for that. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and this abomination called the minority report (Spielberg). But let me in front, ending the twist and cheese was too much for me. Halfway through the movie, I already started to fear such an end, and unfortunately I was right. But that does not mean the film does not deserve its time. Not at all. The first half (as many have already commented) is wonderful. There are some parts where you start to doubt if the director intended to convey the message that the show is a very important thing in the future (we will do that on the corny sf because we can) or simply combine. But paranoia is there and feels "out of common" as well. Good one.
