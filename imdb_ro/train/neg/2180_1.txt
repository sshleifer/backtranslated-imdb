Where to start, there are so many mistakes and horrors about this movie, I'm not sure where to start. Okay, the two guys who wrote this stick. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton first could not make their so-called minds for a name. I think they shared the difference, so the main title is the BRAIN that would NOT bother, but the end screen says that WHAT would NOT bother. None know anything about the medical profession. After all doctors take an oath to "do not harm". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "bad". In addition, a small thing called blood and proper tissue. Rejection would mean Jan's death in the pan. Plus that keeps a monster working with patches. Which medical school graduated from the University of UNIVERSITY FRANKENSTIEN? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that bothered me. In addition, brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a sedated patient? All and all a disaster of a movie is incredibly stupid and undiscovered, except MST3K. I give THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
