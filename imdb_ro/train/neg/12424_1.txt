If you want to laugh like a madman, rent Cage. Cage is about two heroes of war, Billy and Scott who are the best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he is not able to handle himself, so Scott takes him to him. I have never seen a homosexual film with the two main characters. Billy and Scott like to fight and Scott tells Billy he's "still sick last night", among other things. Very beautiful catch phrases such as "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping Pang Pong, cut sh!" Will keep you laughing for hours. Types of American natives who should play Mexican band members are also the best. As it is said, it is "the time spent now. Ba-ba-ba ba ba." I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh off. It was so funny I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
