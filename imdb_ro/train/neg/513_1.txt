Burt Reynolds has come to his career, where he seems to have moved through. He will show up, spend with his friends on the film and take a big salary. It did not seem to matter that the product he represented was pure foolishness. The film did not represent more than "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Execution II" could be tracked. Save for a few scenes of race, there is absolutely nothing to see here. Even beautiful Loni Anderson makes her so bad as a bad blonde, she's embarrassing. If Burt's thought is about Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny, then this is your movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other movie comedy and it will not be worse.
