I really did not really expect a movie outside of America. How can someone take the subject of child sexual abuse and turn it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (which I previously admired) went as a kind of child rescue, Rambo, was ignorant and insulting to all children who were sexually exploited around the world. What is doubly depressing is that amazement and the earth - the movie "Happiness" came out this year before this film. Menge and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments of the smartest viewers there. They have managed to see the ridiculous maneuverability of this subject. Those who think this is a great cinema have a disgusting ignorance, and you have to watch "Happiness" to open your mind to the true horrors of pedophilia. Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold in sexual slavery or molestated by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Mmm ... I wonder. If they make a film about the international slavery of children, no matter the one they owe to each one, make it realistic and emotionally involved instead of this button-pushing stupidity. 1/10
