First of all, I did not sit down to see the premier of the "Star Trek" series see a cowboy flying in space. this is the way an ordinary business episode works 1 Arca≈ü finds a nebula or something along the lines and wants to look more closely but could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and the commuter is deteriorating ... in all the episodes we've seen, all the problems are due to the stupid mistakes of Archer. Oh and you saw the preview of an episode that shows Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?! ?? I plan to watch that episode, but after that I dropped out of the Enterprise and went straight to TV. Come on!!!! This is trek stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, what was the slug banana ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana chip, but had to leave behind for a bad reason. Okay, a little stupid to get your cock in space, but anything. Okay, that was what I thought until they left it on a desert planet !!!!! A BANAN SLAN CAN NOT BE DRAWN !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid these writers are Any way, just saying if the Enterprise is NOT IT IT YOU !!!!!
