At the time of writing this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDb voters have awarded this film a 10 or 1 rating. I can only assume that those who gave it a total of 10 were members or crew members. <br /> <br /> They say that given enough monkeys and enough time and plenty of writing machines, those monkeys, just by random keyboard sales, will eventually complete Shakespeare's complete work. However, I seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find one to give this film a 10 rating. We have patiently watched the first half, assuming that the film could, at a certain level, either develop the plot or the characters, or perhaps make a kind of social commentary or hardly cause intellectual thinking. Without that, I was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror, or even free sex as a way to keep my eye on. Finally, I was disappointed, and therefore much of the second half was seen at double speed, looking in vain for a small fragment of movie redeeming. Unfortunately, there was none. If "Choke," was against a Scooby Doo episode, then I'm afraid the drawing would have won in mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of the cartoon characters, the different casting members' abilities varied between acceptable (the best) and pitifully inferior with Brooke Bailey's portrayal of London's obsessed pseudo-goth, being so bad that almost I felt bad about her. I would have liked to finish on a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a feast of contemporary punk rock, did not even have the fun, much less to serve to increase a very poor shot.
