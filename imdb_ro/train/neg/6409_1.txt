I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the comments on this site. Those who put her on a star must be Buffy fans. Well, I'm Buffy's fan of the first order, but I know shit when I see her. At each level, this movie is terrible. From a technical point of view, you often do not know where you are in this movie, even in one scene, he jumps like a madman for no reason. There is no logic in cinematic terms. Emotional is gloomy for disappointing reasons and tries to be a psychological thriller when it's just confusing. Throwing red holes in the film is an inexpensive way to convey the "atmosphere". I stayed with her long before the last act, but I was too much fun with my friends making MST3K riffs to stop it. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful films, even if it would mean even listing "Scooby Doo" in your resume. Gellar is a beautiful actress, but she (or her agent) can not find a vehicle for her. And, Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I will send you a few dollars if you promise you will not appear in a movie like this again! (Also, Patsy Cline's estate should sue for defamation!)
