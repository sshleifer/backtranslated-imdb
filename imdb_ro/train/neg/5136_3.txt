It falls into the movie category "The way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departments that have to be taken seriously." While Shriek If you know what I did on the thirteenth Friday or my back friend know they are bad, scarecrows do not. Evil Dead has set such a high standard for comedy horror on a budget line, that scarecrows are simply out of place. <br /> <br /> Lack of experience is immediately at play because there is no hint or vibration in the cock body and cockpit of an airplane. Repeated display of an image of 3 men just screams for a story bow, but nothing comes. Although men are obviously the scarecrows, there is no explanation. Knowing this movie is too serious for its own good, it can cause some hindrance. I do not remember if Joe Bob Briggs has ever previewed Scarecrow Scarecrow, but I think he would not have leaned this. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, there are many people who disagree.
