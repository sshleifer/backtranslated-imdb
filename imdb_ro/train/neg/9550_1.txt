After Highlander 2 (about which I'm still in denial) I thought it was impossible to do a sequel that would make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I liked the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with details about the computer and details about the original movie. The original wargames had at least some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie did not know anything about computers except the way a word processor is used. I doubt that he or she even watched the original movie. The act is not even convincing. Save yourself, under no circumstances do you look at this movie. I do not care if the channel is locked on the TV and you can not turn off the TV. THIS MOVIE HELPS YOUR LIFE.
