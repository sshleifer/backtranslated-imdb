I took TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We thought we would make a trip to the east and we thought he would give us an idea of ​​how it was. The film was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride all over Canada with my stomach feeling sick while going up and down and around the curve with the movie at high speed . There were a lot of pictures that they probably shot on this and you think they could have made a better product. If I did this project, I would have offered more pictures, we stopped on road signs to let people know where they are and stay in places to see the landscape. To make such a movie should be 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a whistling sound from the spoke up car sound, could at least put some music on it. If you want a good crossover film Canada's The Railrodder / The National Film Council of Canada, starring Buster Keaton (the film of his last film) in this comic film, Buster Keaton, is headed for a Nova track Scotland and travels to British Columbia
