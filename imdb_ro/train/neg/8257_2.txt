"A Gentleman Game" uses golfing in a country club to illustrate the advent of a teenager about sincerity, prejudice and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was going, just to prove wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that filmmakers ever knew where they were heading. The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and reveals any idea that he will become the mentor of the teenager golf player. It is refreshing, in a way, that this film refuses to follow the majority of simplistic and excessive cinematic formulas. However, much of it still escapes being contrived. When a hat falls, people give up all the pretensions of politeness or fail to stay for the things they think or are exposed to something far less respectable than they take on their place in society. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution for these moments. And except that the club serves as the backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or connection between them. It is a shame that writers and directors could not save a better film, especially thanks to some of the talented actors and their potential.
