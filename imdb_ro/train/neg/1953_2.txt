The first episode of this new show took place today and was horrible. Not only does Shaggy have a new voice that has listened to his lines but is so far from the original concept and animation style that he can hardly be recognized as a Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma disappeared and Scooby's nephew, Scrappy was there, the team has still solved mysteries. This new show instead has Shaggy and Scooby battling a type of survivor like James Bond and his patrons while living in a mansion. There is not even a van called "The Mystery Machine" (and the teaser for the next episode that promised that a transformer robot did not put my mind at ease). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do it? <br /> <br /> The show wins two points for two scenes with Scooby Doo, all of them speaking with correct voices, except Shaggy, and even then they are too generous.
