Maybe this is not the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole one and a half hours of my life and I want it back! Chris Kattan is fun for about 10 minutes. His tall and crazy voice begins to become old, and then you realize the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a long line of former SNLs that have tried movies. Some were brilliant, some failed. There is not much intermediate in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant, and then good, and then not so funny, and then dead ... so I guess he's hitting the whole spectrum in a career. Avoid this movie like plague. </ br /> <br /> c
