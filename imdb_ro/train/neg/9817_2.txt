Wow ... pure brilliance. The return of a thriller / suspense / horror in comedy. After watching this, I never laughed so hard on a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot of 3 characters that were developed only madly - whether they were not written in depth or too deep. If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie, a stupid dialogue, a strange story, unnecessary scenes, lost characters, bad sound and terrible general development, then this one is the one to watch. Make sure you continue to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and on the totally inadequate police investigation scenes. /> <br /> This is a remarkable new low screen performance and writing and to stay on it for the whole time makes you stupid, daring or courageous.
