This early film Adam Sandler could be compared to his life as a comic in the same period since 1989. Constant character's confirmation of his genius and hidden comic frustration about humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than scenario. The film is nothing compared to its successful films, such as Big Daddy or even Billy Maddison. Sadly, Sandler has not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful, fun way when this film was made, just like his character. Most of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognizable talent and beating because he's too ugly and can not make women. The film is hard to follow and is not treated as a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers along the film, often referring to the low budget content of the movie or to questionable content. The movie is finally strange and embarrassing to look. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw this movie after it was over, for fear that if it found out more about it, it would destroy Sandler's career. Get it to the video store, rent it for free, and it was another waste of time.
