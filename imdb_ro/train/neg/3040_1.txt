With a title like this you know you're getting too much junk. By acting badly. Bad script. The bad director. Bad grammar. The movie makes a lot of noise that really does not music and a lot of people scream. The film makes a bad stereotype. Why does every film with the black hero have drug addicts? Why the hero must always dance to be successful? Why does the famous rapper always be in the dance? Why is the letter "s" not in the title? Hollywood must stop the bad audience and make a movie that has people with brains who know how English speaks right. <br /> <br /> Do your self-esteem and you're not going to see.
