Think of the end of Grudge 2 as follows: - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cuts - and a horrible mirror, Oh and underwater marine marine ... yay ... not a good movie ... I seriously do not enjoy them. The poster of the film is extremely deceptive and I found it was just sucking people to look at him ... I can not believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save Time and Money ... Watch Watch Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel like it was an effort put into it ... Im Mike and Im exit
