An attempt to make a cross to appeal to those who do not appreciate the opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, does not fail. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a record of Pavarotti, which does the best. The cake revolves around a love story with a doctor who heals his neck, which has suddenly become annoying. <br /> <br /> Just because it came out a long time ago, it's largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a stage presence outside of his singing talent, and nothing he does in this film contradicts this opinion. His commitment lies in the fact that he does not reject the horrible scenario. Perhaps because large works can have stupid stories, he tolerated this. Who knows, except those involved? We have to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and peeled. This movie is like a trudging through cold mud to bring out some juicy noises (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this is not one of them. Just get one of its many opera or vocal recordings and recognize the main tenor where it is best. This would be one of the greatest IMDb movies if more people remembered it and gave it a little votes; would be appropriate in a list that includes more efforts by singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through the film. Most of the time, everything goes badly wrong because of an incompetent act or a horrible scenario. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he did not show such a wonderful voice. As effective as an actor (the work asks), even Jimmy Stewart would not have been able to save this turkey from a scenario. I give her a polite thing out of 10, because someone can become a fan of Pavarotti singing and operating because of this movie.
