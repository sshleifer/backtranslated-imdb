Designed only to disturb (or amuse) any intelligent self. If the director's intention was that the viewer did not like the title character, then it would have been good, but I know there is no Hollywood director to criticize the pro-Marxist American movement, especially a director from the 1970s. There is so much idiotic dialogue that sometimes I was wondering if I was actually looking at a comedy. Would not you blame yourself because you think it's a satire? this is the way the naive movie appears. Spacek was in her side of left films that brings me to the obvious and inevitable conclusion that the redhead is a Hollywood madman. But, I mean, are not they all? Beautiful women, but it's for the brain.
