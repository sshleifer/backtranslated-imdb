We have all seen unceasing epochs in our times, but this really exceeds all of them! The film is so long and slow that, to put things in perspective, I felt much older when I left the cinema than I had entered. With a length of almost 4 hours, it could have been done in a tele-serial series. What begins as a promising comedy slowly loses its rhythm. Nikhil avani woven the plot around 6 love stories and he can not do justice to any of them ... There is no interconnection between them to start with, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be forced to connect the story. <br /> <br /> The situation is aggravated by the Silly dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindu cinema over the years) and the stupid cinema. Priyanka does not realize she really needs to play a role rather than look glam on the screen ... A total loss of beauty without the ability to act. And then there is Govinda loud and humorous - better than jimi -carrey Akshay Khanna, who keeps laughing at the top of their lungs to irritate the already tired viewers. The only good part in the film is the story of John & Vidya's love and the pleasant comedy of sohail & Isha. But they are so good in their roles that only these two couples could have justified the movie without jabbing it with other heaps of characters. Their shine is lost in the middle of other substandard plot lines. I think director has made two separate films (it can be more!) And a beginner assistant has mixed all the recordings, beyond a point of sorting them, so the director has no choice but to show it as a single movie. . <br /> <br /> Watch it only if you want to test your patience!
