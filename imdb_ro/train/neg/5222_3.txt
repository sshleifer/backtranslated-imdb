This is really a really bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story that combines all sorts of things that make no sense. It just seems like a wrong experiment. Secondly, actors can not play in a realistic way. I can not even talk like an actor. Why did I buy this movie? And what am I supposed to do now?
