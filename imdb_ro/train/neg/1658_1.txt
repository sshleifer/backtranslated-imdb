This is probably the most boring film in history. He was really looking forward to seeing this film, given the actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see three Amigo than ever to see this movie. He immediately left the DVD player directly in the trash. I apologize to those of you who appreciate this movie, however, you probably liked the new Coke. I'm at a loss to see why someone would have enjoyed this movie, it's slow, boring and does not have any real plot. Wait 105 minutes for the movie to begin. I understand that it was made in 1976, but it was a bad TV era. Thanks to God's disco and Three's Company went along with shut-off goggles and Bay City Rollers. Well, just my thoughts.
