I * loved * the original Scary movie. I'm a great fan of the parody - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the smartest form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original film, then they temporarily forgot it when they made a sequel. I think Wayans are a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even geniuses make mistakes. The movie begins with the promise. I liked the "Exorcist" parody, especially "come here". Now, that's Wayans quality stuff. But, besides, I can only think twice when I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then gets busy and begins to talk about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a call of prey!" It was kind of funny. 2) "Save the Last Dance" parody, where Cindy's character inappropriately knocks a girl while practicing new moves. But even short-term chicks do not fit for the scary laughter of the first Scary movie. The rest of the film is pure garbage, filled with cheap gags. The first and the second films that are subtle or implicit are big and exaggerated. For example, in Scary I, several insinuations are made to suggest that the character Ray is gay. This was hilarious. But in the movie Scary Movie II, the whole scene of the penis stiffness with Ray under the bed was a disturbing mind and incredibly unhappy. This is the whole movie model. Humor of shock * alone * does not take a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As much as my pain to evaluate a Wayans movie so low, I will give it a 2 out of 10.
