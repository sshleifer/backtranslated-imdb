I found the darkness to be too loud. It had some kind of great idea and ambitious ideas, not bad scenes of action and some sprinkling moments that make you go to UGH! BUT, it was pointed to the point of confusion. You do not really know what's always going on in dark scenes and for a movie shot on Super 8 Film, you already have everything you do with nasty traces. As with Nathan Schiff's movies, it's too much. Director Leif Jonker appears to want to make an original film but does not have the know-how to do it. The room is never pointed at the right place, the lack of some fundamental elements such as how to shoot simple scenes and how to illuminate an injured movie. The actors are rather uneven and weird. But despite these negative, the music is good, the gore is a lot and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances. Is it a classic? Is it worthy of the two discs worth praise? NOT. But it is a good first try. Now if these boys would stop for this movie (as I understand the only one they've done here) for a while and try again, they could do better.
