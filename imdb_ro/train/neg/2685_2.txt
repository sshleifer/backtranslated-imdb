I never shot an online movie, but I felt moved to do it after I saw him. One does not appear at someone's funeral and tells the lost: "My relatives have died, why should I care about you?" Minus propaganda, it was little, if anything, to be called "art." As the daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick. Any deaf person who feels a vibration of immense would probably investigate, do not ignore it. The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are only a few things I should be saying: The Holocaust is one; this is another. I wish these shooting factors were not so arrogant (and inefficient).
