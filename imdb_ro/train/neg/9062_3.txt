This movie was different in that it did not show the typical homosexual stereotypes that I used to see. But that does not change the fact that he does not have a complete story. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see the screen, since black gay characters are seldom seen, and when they are the characters, they are usually not fully developed. But how hard it would have been for the writer to write a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Or about a story that was focused. It really does not seem to be a point in this movie, and even if it's a low-budget movie, it's not yet an excuse for lack of story or plot.
