A well-placed entry into the serial killer who, unfortunately, is shot in his own claim to be really satisfactory. Willem Dafoe is gorgeous as a NYC detective who is trying to discover what appears to be a copycat using the same killing techniques related to Renaissance art used in a series of crimes he has solved years ago. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's junior partner and has good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to conveniently link the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of a previous victim, and Peter Stormare is a kind of Dafoe art broker / tutor ... hard to get, though Stormare is, of course, never boring. The end of the film is particularly disappointing. Look fast for Deborah Harry as a younger neighbor than Dafoe's future.
