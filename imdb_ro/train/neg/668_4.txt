So Prom Night was supposed to be a horror film and a thriller. I'm a huge giant and I was afraid to see this movie at first, but after seeing it, it's neither horror nor thriller. I was practically fun with the movie in my place, because it was so predictable. You could predict what will happen next. The young actors were fine to play their characters, but I should have said the killer was certainly at the top of the game - acting wisely. Yeah, I'll give the props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or frightening. There were almost zero "jump-in-seat" scenes. So do not lose ten dollars, seeing it in theaters, wait until it gets to DVD.
