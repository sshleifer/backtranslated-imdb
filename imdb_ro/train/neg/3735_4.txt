Actress Patty Duke wrote a witty, funny and harsh book about her actress career, her love life, and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost put her in peace. With this richly attracted material (and Patty is playing in the final act), it would be thought that a television crack like Gilbert Cates could bring them all to a movie, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the sketchy narrative is not absorbed, we are never allowed to go with what is happening, and production seems to be amazed by a low budget. The actors are miscast, and the fact that the Duke eventually does not pay anymore - the fake reality of the movie is so thick at the moment that Patty can not bring stability to the script. It seems that the producers were quite honest (and conscious) to steer the film into Duke's final diagnosis and mental freedom, but left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
