This is pretty much a low budget, made for television, a type of movie designed to take advantage of the success of the original. I'm a fan of cinemas, and that would have been good if he did not attach the name "Cube", because as he is, the director and script of the original were better, and this movie almost ruined my taste for the whole series. Characters are annoying and clich√©, there are problems with continuity and some production shocks. The story hardly has the chance to develop because of the useless dialogue and suffers from it. They use more or less the same tricks of horror over and OVER alongside the movie, and because the first one was so good, it turns out to be a disappointment. If this was a cinema solution, I would probably give it four. The "1" rating I give was quite a statement about how it paralyzed the effects and intelligence from the first.
