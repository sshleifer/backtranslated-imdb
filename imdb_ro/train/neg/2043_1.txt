Terrible, terrible, terrible. A startling remark at the beginning and some ugly autopsy photos do not make a good movie. Again, I am amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in producing a film production, yet they have no pride in realizing that what they have done is a bunch of nonsense. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a redeemed feature so as to balance my criticism at least, but the only one I could think of was that Pink's opening piece he was pretty good ... I wonder if he saw that? <br /> <br /> Watch this at your dangers, boredom can kill you.
