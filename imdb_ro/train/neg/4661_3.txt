This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie and serves as a statement about racism. It's worth watching to understand that movies reflect how we feel about issues when they are produced, and not about how long they are presented. It means that this is a 70 movie is not a 40 movie (WW2). However, there are some good action scenes of seven seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Barrage. The story is based on the captain teaching that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could come from a movie in the Civil War and not from a World War II movie that reflects what the movie means. The black father gives the German women an innocent peck on the cheek, and the White Capture gets angry. I liked the movie in terms of curiosity, because the stars and genre were interesting to me.
