The movie's bad. There is no other way to say. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what it is or will take care of a Walker. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 70s. The subject was not credible for 2007, even if it was established in DC. I think this sounded true to anyone else who followed her just as the applause was small and fast at the end of the year. Most did not even stand for Q & A. I do not think Schrader really believed the movie before. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut, as if they had never been done or simply did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next, and you had to try to figure out or guess what's going on. I really did not get the private life or Woody's (Carter) boyfriend. What were all "artistic" images of male slavery and torture (from the prisons in Iraq)? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt to try to create this private subculture for Woody (Car) character. It did not work. It did not make much sense either. The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (machine) without blemish. You really had a wonderful sense of what a Walker might be (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will not be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Bored. You do not see him! It's painful! Unless you're a true fan of Harrelson.
