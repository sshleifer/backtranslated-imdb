Where to start. The cinema was great. When the film started for the first time due to the scenes of the original landscape, I thought I was in a good movie. Then Bigfoot's nail appeared. It looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion King and child of King Kong's love. He took everything from the credibility of the character. Now I knew it was not a Bigfoot to follow people walking around forests for no apparent reason, but a cartoon cgi. Since then, the whole movie has been shot for me. The money they pushed into the toilet for those they could spend on a suit like Patterson. It was the best Bigfoot suit that no one else could match him. I'm a fan of the Bigfoot movie and I was warned about this movie, but my compulsion made me watch this movie and I was disappointed with the previous reviews. I know after reading this review, you will also say I have to see Sasquatch hunters have to see the hunters at Sasquatch. Then you will tell me why I scattered my good money on such an attractive movie of boring!
