I have to say that I am rather disappointed with this horror movie. I did not even scare myself as I watched her. It's also not too suspense either .... I was able to guess halfway through the movie ... So .. what's left? Ring is a scary movie. .. I want other movies to stop copying from it (for example, trademark: long hair). Give me an originality. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie.
