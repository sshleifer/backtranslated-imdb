There is a high level of expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a play led by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further amplified when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes, does it seem that these expectations could be met and then? Nothing. What should be a light comedy, sneak into the lead-filled melodrama, hard to handle, with a gig to be worn. Suzy Parker's recent novel was often criticized for her performance, or lack of a single, in this film, but in a movie where even the big Cary Grant appears flat and wooden, Parker's attack seems to be unfair. Not even a glowing light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the wealth of this unbelievable, disturbing and completely useless scenario that draws on itself and draws the interest and patience of the viewer with it. /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, continues to try to breathe a life in the process, but the terrible scenario is beyond resuscitation. The desperate and useless effort of pulling a half-hearted laugh from the crowd audience at the final moments of the movie serves only to add insult to the injury. This film is only a major disappointment at all levels.
