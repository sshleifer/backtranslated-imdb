This movie has a very simple plot, but in a very bad way. The whole film refers to a girl who sucks through a gate to another dimension, after years later she opens again with a witch, while a group of friends (including the actor who has trouble overcoming her former the girlfriend who is one of the other camps together with the new partner ... another girl ... it's true that I'm lesbian and there is, of course, nudity, for no special reason. Unfortunately, the demon turns back on the adult girl. Also, unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. Where exactly were they? Where did the demon come from? How did the child survive in a place full of bad demons? Who the hell coached her and made him a gladiator-like outfit? The act is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say because the writing is so bad, maybe there was nothing to do with it. I give him three, because the fighter was pretty good and the effects were quite fun, even if they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
