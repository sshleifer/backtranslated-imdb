Also known in a different form as the "House of Exorcism," this little filthy movie is so precious to kill any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The back ground involves European tourism Elke Sommer, who has a chance to deal with Telly Savalas, which looks the same as the devil he saw on a square fresco. Sommer is given a walk in a mysterious house in the country where Savalas happens to be a butler. There she is confused with a dead woman, and the real theaters of the soap theater begin. The husband's husband's husband's husband had an affair with the dead, filial woman of her son. The young man who gave Sommer a ride? Well, the woman gives the driver "back lessons" and her husband knows and does not care. Eventually, most of the casting is killed, Sommer is drugged and raped, escapes, and the viewer is taken to a climax on board a plane. .. which must resemble the empty theaters that it has played. The alternative version of this "house of exorcism" has scenes added adding a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and letter-boxed. There is "extra" after the final credits; erased sex <br /> and gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is fast and angry, but his script is terrible. There are semi-baked ideas, abandoned parks, and amazing facilities that do nothing but propel this in a way ahead. You have life as dummies for practicing funerals, the blind matriarch does not do everything blind, and Savalas is given the same congratulations he has in Kojak (who <br /> <br /> haunts you, baby? ). The project seems to have two star names, then quickly wrote the script, something that is happening now in Hollywood on a daily basis. Savalas seems completely lost, giving his lines quietly, and wanted his character not to have died in "The Dirty Duzen." Sommer runs around and yells and pants a lot, but her character is empty, I use the term "character" freely. Only what we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie and your reaction to it may depend on how hard you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. I can not recommend "Lisa and the devil." <br /> <br /> It is not rated and includes all the copies of the VHS ending, it contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult situations <br /> <br />
