When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was just like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this movie and other movies is that the story is very weekly. They are bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK, but the rest is total stupidity. Do not see this horror movie, go and see Ring 2 or any other movie that has much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that have a virus and the virus spreads and makes people zombie. I've seen enough. The only good thing in the movie is when I'm on a roof and I'm shooting celebrities, infected.
