I felt bad about the actors in this thing. Undoubtedly, a high school theater class could do a better job or at least one job. Actors must have thought this would be their great chance to work in a movie, certainly it was not. Besides the terrible act, the stories were boring and, for the most part, predictable. The remote control did not make any sense. To hurt me, she had the best premise in the bouquet. It's all about supporting low-budget films and giving our producers a real chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just looked for good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with links to the film. You can fool people to see this, but you can not smile at what they saw. I gave a 2 instead of 1 because at least the boxer's story tried to warm up the heart. Of course he did not fail, but he tried. I booked 1 s for the worst of the worst. Do yourself a favor and jump over this dribbling. I'd like to have.
