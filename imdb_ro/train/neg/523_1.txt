It's amazing for me that goes on today for entertainment. maybe I'm a dinosaur in the 1950s, and I do not have a connection with the current generation of films, and it seems that this is the case because so many people liked it. It seemed wrong and vulgar to me. I have not said that about many movies in my life, but it fits the bill. Humor is sophomoric and brutal. I'm not a politically correct person, and I've even found homosexual jokes, not only not funny, but even offensive (they're not homosexuals). The main character in the film is not even a pleasant person, but just pathetic. When the movie ended, I heard a number of people commenting on how disappointed they were in what they were paying good money to see.
