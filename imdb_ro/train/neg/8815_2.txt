Yes, I will tell you about this, so do not read if you want surprises. I took this with the title "The Bad Christmas". There was another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, it was not as good. It started quite interesting to watch the bastard (if you can call it that) by watching the kids in the neighborhood and writing in books about who's naughty and beautiful, but after a while you're looking for action and this movie is not delivered. You need character development, but this goes overboard and you're never sure why the heck kind of stops. Almost an hour kills three out of four people, while a lot of people look great, and the boys they kill do not even reach their targets, they just have fun with it. This is one of the unsuccessful attempts of the killer to cheat the naughty game. Then he continues to try to kill the other guy and tries to break his house by squeezing into the fireplace. He gets quickly stuck and barely manages to get out. Then he goes through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by biting him in the bedroom. He can not kill him so he takes a star from the tree and swallows the boys. What the hell was a tree even in the bedroom, first of all? Oh, yes, the killer, before this killing, stopped at a party and had some fun. Well, that's all about it, except for the people in the town watching him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and the song he wants to play. What was that about? He continued to talk about something that was never explained. How do you end up asking, since I have spoilers, I'll tell you. Run away from the truck and continue, let it just say it was blades !!!!!!!!!!!!
