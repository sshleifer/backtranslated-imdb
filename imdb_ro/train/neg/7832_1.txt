I have just managed to get through one episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was inclined and down, right, worthy. The act was tragic. Eion Bailey, in spite of the best attempts to be dramatic, remains largely void. His eyebrows suggest a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani could have played equally easy with the dams in distress in a silent film. The characters were cartoons, each playing stereotypical doubt in the most random, meandering plot. Special effects with special effects can be exempted, given the budget for the TV miniseries. But attempts to create suspense and surprise by distracting cinematography have contributed to failure. I have the impression that the end should have been wizarding and surprising, but it was blade and did not have much to do with the rest of the story. If we had to compare general quality to something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on par with Hercules from NBC.
