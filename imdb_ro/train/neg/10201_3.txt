This is a thriller typical of "Perfect Crime". A perpetual crime is being executed, and the police officer investigating, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who is guilty. The audience must wait for the whole movie to get the guilty man caught. The result is any episode of "Columbo" or "crime he wrote". The director himself refers to the hackney story, showing the cop watching a Matlock episode! This story barely fills for 90 minutes, but the director insists on using all 120 minutes of filling with each of the clips in the book. Jump over that, you do not lose anything.
