This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-parcels that developed simultaneously to the climax at the end, but it became more like a yawn. The writing was tricked, the rhythm was slow and dissociated and the characters were dull. George Clooney seems to need to enter a gym, Matt Damon beat her and the others seemed to read his lines in a teleprompter. The most serious part of this film was that it was carefully designed to be politically correct, and so did not say anything about the big deal, the oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentations that offer more enthusiasm. Watch it only if there is nothing else to do.
