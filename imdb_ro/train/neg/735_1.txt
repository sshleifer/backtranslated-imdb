Michael, five, sees his mother stabbing to death by his father in the series "The Highwayman," who later suicides. "20 years later," Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to "master their own fears" at the Halloween night costume party. Morty, a large wooden doll, kept in the attic by the Indian, becomes possessed by the spirit of the dead father and kills them through their phobias. Characters are thrown into a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, thrown into the air, etc. Morty morphs in the father and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. After finding a girl cut and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay in the house, have fun jokes, crack and have sex. The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original 13th of Friday) is surprisingly delightful as a grandmother, but this is even more meaningless and confusing than the original and is full of false, brain-dead characters, repeating flashbacks, and enormous destruction of the work room. In addition, the only two minority characters (Indian girl and half black) are the first to die. Blah!
