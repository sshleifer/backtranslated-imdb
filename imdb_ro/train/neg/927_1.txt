I mean, how could Charles Band, Full Moon's head, leave a total ball like DEMONICUS. I mean, the green light should never start. The story is repetitive, the characters are at least the weakest, there is no real story about Tiran, other than a bad guy. Then the writer or director goes off to a bad end. That's a bad thing, Demonicus gets up. The last survivor escapes into a deadly cave, then a picture of Chimera comes to life, cheap to add and throw it out. When he walks at FUNHOUSE home. A statue that was destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason only to collapse over it. I mean, that does not make sense. What the hell was Charles's thinking that would make this gunpowder, with four different film companies that were so desperate for the movies. He could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. Thank you to Turkey.
