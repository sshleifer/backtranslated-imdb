"Magnolia" is an absurd, stunning presentation that adds very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a series without episodes without any concern of consistency. The camera is shooting through corridors and corridors, trapping sad characters. Where is the reason for caring for these people? The usual theme seems to be people screaming a lot, who can not take care of the others (except the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman) and are self-destructive offenders who fall either in pieces or die. I was reminded of how much I did not like Shine because of the irreconcilable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive and unattractive characters here, why would we want to spend time with them? After I said that, there is nothing vengeful about Magnolia. Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are sprinkled on his abandoned cloth. There are two ideas in particular: the bomb. Both are happening in the last hour of this 188-minute movie. One has the camera alarms from one character to another, while each one plays one of the folk songs of Aimee Mann's caf√©. Sweet, but ineffective, because we can not see what's gathering together. The other idea to which I refer can only be revealed to say that it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous. "Magnolia" has great action. Especially Tom Cruise, who unleashes a show I did not meet in him. And John C. Reilly plays perhaps the most decent and really good cop in recent memory. But everything adds to nothing. When the unexpected secret event happened, a girl behind me in the theater could no longer keep it and said, "That's stupid!" My feeling is that most filming will agree.
