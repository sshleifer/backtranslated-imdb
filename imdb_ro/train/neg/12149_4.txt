Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses tries to be a satirical look at the role of the media in the government. At best, it might apply how the US is trying to control the media during the Iraq war, but it ends up feeling empty. There is never a real tension in the story and the never-good act. Worst, the direction of the movie is atrocious, it focuses more on unusual camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond "It's not a strange way to hold the camera." The special effects are pretty bad ... in a moment, a video of an explosion is green shielded over the city, and it's the best laugh. The film has several bright spots ... namely ads for post-zombie services (including a recovery service and a party bus). But it's too little to make the movie useful. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same low production value, but behind it there is much more spirit, humor and talent.
