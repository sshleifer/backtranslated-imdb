What is this? This must undoubtedly be the biggest loss of film, settings and room ever. I know you can not wait for a height of 80 years, but this is too bad to be true. I learned this movie for $ 0.89 and still feel the need to claim my money. Can you imagine who is STINKS hard? <br /> <br /> Who is the violent killer in this movie and what are his motivations ??? In fact, you could not care less. And why should you be? The producers of this garbage sure did not care. They have not tried to create a low voltage. The director (Stephen Carpenter - I think it's easier to find money with a name like that) also made Kindred (1986), which was quite pleasant and recently made the soul of Survivors. Also, they were stupid, but at least he had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who?) Yes, it is, you put Melrose Place. His very memorable character dies in about 15 minutes. after opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or miss it afterwards, who cares? The rest of the actors ... they are not really worth the terms actors, they are completely uninteresting. You hope to die a quick and painful death ... and not just their characters. My humble opinion = 0/10
