After watching this movie in the end, I am completely amazed at the adoration they receive both to critics and online users. Is it the worst ever Western? No, I would not say that. But "the last great Western American", a phrase I have seen applied several times? Not for a moment. A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs credible characters who speak a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this movie is among the strangest and clich√© that I've ever seen. The film can be measured in groaners per minute; how many times is an actor or scriptwriter act to say something that no human being will say in real life? There are so many situations in this respect that distract attention. Rows of cheese come in waves; predictable, non-original and often. <br /> <br /> If the bad dialogue does not bother you, what about the bad wars? Few Westerners can show you the fight against garbage, which is completely unbelievable, desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic advantage for such a fight, like in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very rigid and very rigid choreography of the early coup is just another reason to leave this movie on the list of good Westerns. The end of the showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but until then, I was so disinterested in the film that it was beyond the rescue. Apart from these flaws, I can say that the images are amazing - the movie is well shot and the settings look great. Action is acceptable, especially with regard to actors who have been given work. However, if you are looking for the last great Western American, do yourself a favor - Go Unforgiven rent instead. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
