I grew up on the theatrical version of "Superman II" ("S2T") and, as a child, I liked more than part I because it not only contained more Superman and three Superman villains, but it started with a bang? ? the best Clark Kent and Superman transformations and rescue scenes. The children did not have to wait for the Superman to appear on the screen as in Part I. Now as an adult, I see how they could fall with S2T (see: my review) story about how they shot prematurely and unjustifiably the original director, Richard Donner of Part II. (Unfortunately, after I finally saw Richard Donner Cut (or "S2RD") I still can not recommend it completely. Gone was the biggest change scene of Superman, the whole rescue from Paris, as it was a wonderful review of the first part of the S2T opening. In fact, everyone wrote the words: "Previously on Superman?" in S2RD The special effects were not great either in part I or S2T but S2RD were in great I'm going to recognize that some new scenes have worked, and others that have been removed, have encountered departures, such as any scene in the "suite" honeymoon. "Generally, if you grew up on S2T as I did and I loved it as a child - not as an adult, you should see S2RD absolutely because it is almost a new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Alert Spoiler) Unfortunately, the most serious change happens last: gone it was also the strange kiss of amnesia from S2T replaced with exactly the same end as "I". It's not just a lazy, uninfluenced childhood, it does not make sense on why Clark will return to that dinner, if those events have never happened. And will it continue to "turn time" for every confrontation?
