I've been trying to watch this movie twice and even then quickly repeat the irritating pieces, but I could not do it until the end. I do not understand how this movie * really received good comments. I think these people who give so good reviews just try to face the movie for marketing purposes. Their comments seem very unrealistic and look like an internal activity, which makes things worse. Movies should receive true positive comments about their own steam and not the contrived ones! <br /> <br /> The actor was reminiscent of a cheesy porn movie, and not in a fun way. I do not mind the low-budget movies that have a bad attitude if they know how to work with them. <br /> <br /> I found the lead character to be irritating. His facial expressions and humor were unbearably childish. I thought she intended to make the woman's conspiracy look more pleasant and more grounded, but it was even worse. The scenario was also very strange (his bosses went over the business speech) and endless sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> We did not find anything redeeming about this movie, except some of the attractive women. I never felt that a rating was that deceptive. I was interested in his premise, but scared of anything else. Of course you see if you want, but I did not want anyone else to raise their hopes / waste of time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I am just ... Probably not.
