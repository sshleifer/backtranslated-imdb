this movie was not absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. ACTUAL act was pretty good! Jeffrey comb did a pretty good darn job as a crazy scientist who is kind of his specialty if you do not know such things: D. forsythe ticket .. well, i'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. is too good for these things, and his role was not exactly demanding. I rented this to the two leaders, and I was not very disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half-shark half man. There are no Shakespeareans. In addition to the hoarse plot and the bad dialogue, I would like to see that cinematography has left many things desirable. there were photos if they were trying to look "cold," but they got to hide the scene or just get out of the noise. they also blew it several times when they had a decent dialogue and were cut off before they could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a fan Jeffrey comb, it is worth checking out. he offers great performance and does everything he can with the character. forsythe is neither evil nor be female lead. but if I remember her name. bottom line, I would not waste my time.
