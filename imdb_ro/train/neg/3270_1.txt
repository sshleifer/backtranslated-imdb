It is pleasant and fast-paced. <br /> <br /> There is no way on earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. There must be a credit for his audition that he persuaded them to throw him. I soon accepted him as a naive young country boy. While he was the best interpreter, most of the others were also very involved. In particular, police interaction was natural and balanced and worked very well. It's only 45 minutes, so the plot is not complex. The more the matter is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant, and the background is atmospheric, especially because all colors are extremely rich. The gang is identifiable for the foreign audience, but it still manages to be distinctly Australian.
