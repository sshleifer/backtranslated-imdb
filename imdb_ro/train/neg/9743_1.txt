That line begins with a boring and boring SF movie. Grand Vorelli in the Devil Doll movie builds a teleporting machine just to cut Blanchard's funding, a bearded man who has a thing to do with arches and men with big eyebrows. When the experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. She tries to show up in Blanchard's house, with her beautiful lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something is going wrong and spinning like a rat. The rest of the film is dedicated to a good orange-haired doctor who walks on the shocking people in London with his muscled hand and wears a diaper on his face. There are more murders, some modest papers, and eventually the doctor disappears in the place where rat doctors meet. Fortunately, no one has decided to make a follow-up.
