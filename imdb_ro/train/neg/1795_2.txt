I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a member of a test audience and the only thing that kept me in my place was the chance to complete the post-screening survey. I felt that the biggest problem with the film was the lack of a main plot. Instead, it was composed of (too) many sub-plots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not one character that is sufficiently developed for the public to form any attachment. What the director and the producer have failed to tell us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact, any sub-plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without bringing a serious defeat to the film. (Winning time would have allowed the sub-parcels and the remaining characters to grow so much.) In a nutshell, the club's Hungry Bachelors Club board is overcrowded with food and appetizers when it comes to an entre.
