I have seen Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other fine works of the blueprints canon from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, The Tornado Human (alias Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. For a pure hole, lack of skill in film production and absolute enthusiasm (frankly too much), the human tornado can not be overcome. The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend, Dolemite, beats a white woman, when some rascal policemen live in the house for no good reason and you do not know that! The woman in bed with Dole is only the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite's cry: "& $ * @ $ are you true?" Subtlety has never been his strong point. Highlights? Theme cameo by a very young Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters fame), continuity errors (characters looking in one go in one shot and the other, Dolemite's suit changing their colors every night club break ) and Queen Bee's demon's eyes in her first scene. But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did Man really think he was looking at this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the excitement it has. Whether to jump completely off a rock or to launch orders to his gang in rhyme (for example: Quick!) In a grotto! I have a plan to let this mother make the grave! take over the board, never more than at any time he makes kung fu Climate fights are shot at high speed but sometimes slows down to let Rudy break and teeth as if they accelerated the film as an effect or if we really wanted to believe it was so fast. In any case, Matrix is ​​not like that. <br /> <br /> The human tornado, like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun, and you certainly have to give credit to these people for the effort you've made.
