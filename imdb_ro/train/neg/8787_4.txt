I heard the first time about White Noise when I saw the TV ad. Until then, I did not even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and I decided to go and see it. Now being a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. Michael Keaton's in it, and he's roaming. Unfortunately, the movie did not give birth. He tried to be an 8th Sense or a mix of echoes, and he did not do any harm. It has a very promising start, but the middle just draws on rehearsal, and ends with a totally poor twist that any monkey might have realized. Unfortunately, like most of Scary's current movies, it is based on loud noises and bangs to make the public jump. This movie could have been a lot more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
