I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel like I have to watch the animation of The Batman. His garbage absolutely! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s, so what the hell is she trying to do with the winning formula? I feel like I write a letter of complaint at WB. The original animation was dark and full of beats, just as Batman intended. BM had to bother Batman of the Future. Now they are doing this. Joker does not look like DC Joker. DC should sue. I urge everyone who agrees with me to send by e-mail or write to WB and use the power of people to return to the original formula
