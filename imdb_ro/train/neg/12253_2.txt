I never thought a movie could be so atrocious, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible action, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was terrible, and in terms of sex scene / stupid killing in one, it was a bad move from the word. It was really shocking and not a compliment! How can someone do this movie, watch it and then say, "Yes, this is a good movie. People will look at it." If you did not see it, please do not get rich :-(
