This movie has been designed to be a successful film, and it is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to watch flashy graphics. With this in mind, the film offers, perhaps not as well as the ultra-bright iron, but pretty good. Apart from popcorn action and special effects, the film falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. Many viewers, including myself, will complain about the way most characters have been seriously altered, but that only makes the film a bad adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. Decision makers have focused more on making eye-catching than they did to the mind. Characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cams. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well-developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the characters are thrown to the side of the road to make room for all the important candy. The character of Wolverine is fully developed after 30 minutes, as is Sabertooth, although Victor takes some surprises late in the film. The "last boss" of the film is a resounding and perverse adaptation of the film. the original character and just becomes a development to show why he is as he is. Clearly, the directors felt that all they needed to do was create a bad guy who could do whatever he wanted and slam the name of a popular character. Very disappointing ...
