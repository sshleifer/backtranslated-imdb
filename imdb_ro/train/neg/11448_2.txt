Under no circumstances is this movie as bad as "Perfect Stranger," but it was not funny. He was unable to stay in a comedy - he jumped from SNL, Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to high-end, to "slapstick," "Loser" types comedies. Although there were quite funny moments (falling down the hill), nobody was very funny or remarkable in any way. "Schindler's list" was more fun (and felt shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg had to be a high school, a college or a loser who lived at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek, in the worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, the Actor seriously, if I had only to call him one, I was given a crap to read in the room. The story draws and is completely predictable to the end (there is no spoiler if Adam Samberg's mother wishes to see her). Do not spend money to watch this movie and maybe Lorne Michaels will get suggestions and start producing quality movies (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
