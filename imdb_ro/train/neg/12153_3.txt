Masses feeding was just another movie that tries to make some money off the zombie mystery, which is mostly due to the popularity of films like Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts from an armed guard station and reports that the Lazarus virus is near isolation and the city will soon be free to do the business again. The problem is that it is totally false. Zombies are misbehaving and only a small minority of people are aware. These include Torch (William Garberina), shooting room Sherry (Rachael Morris), lead anchor woman (who, for some reason, Shelly is on the list) and Roger (Patrick Cohen). Torch and Sherry are against people's lies, but the station is headed by the secret service (or another government agency) and they are very censored. This film puts a bed on its back on the box-cover saying: "We support FEEDING MASSES at a higher level than any of George A. Rombero's three Dead Movies." The source of that quote lost ALL credibility with me. Let me just say that this movie is bad. I do not mean to say badly as if I expected more (obviously, though, I was), but I mean bad in the sense that I could not find in the film any kind of redeeming qualities. Action on all sides is either made or too light. Do anybody remember their lines or read the books? I can not even think of what was the best part of the movie or the best actress / actress. It was not really one. If I had to give a sign to a person, I would say that Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character, but that does not mean much. I should have recommended you to pass on this film, despite the fact that the cover box is pretty good (it was what originally attracted me to the film). 3/10
