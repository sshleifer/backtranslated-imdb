We just finished watching "El Otro". I always took my hat on the shows of Julio Chavez, being a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I think it would have been worse if it was not for Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie to have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense. Perhaps the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is worn and impresses the audience with scenes that shook you a little. It gives you something to think, but not in a good way. Generally, I certainly did not like this movie.
