The entire movie should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme really did not develop as a story. Once the original idea of ​​a cowboy? Courageous (stupid?) Bombardier has been introduced, and this happens very early in the movie, the rest is repeated. Characters have not been explored, and site and policy aspects have been ignored. There have been some beautiful views of the awful difficulties faced by troops in a foreign environment and the difficulty of differentiating between friend and foe. But the way in which the unity functioned the great faith! Individual performances were good, and the special effects were appropriate, but were not enough to overcome the lack of content.
