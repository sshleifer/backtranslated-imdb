F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrible movies in my time, but that takes your load! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I can not say in words how bad this movie is. Besides the plot that is not really there, the comical nonsense that acts, the hilarious excuse for the terrible zombies; You know what, I could go all day. Every little thing in this movie is either stupid, useless, shit or embarrassing. Exploring someone who wants to watch this movie ... I do not like it! I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my shelf. It is hidden even from the bottom ass fucking huge. I could not even apologize for a movie. It's so bad.
