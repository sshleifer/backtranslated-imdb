There is no reason why I can understand why this movie has ever been made. Why should we continue Hollywood to create a horrible update of one classic after another? (Cases from the point of view: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - awful!) Christopher Lloyd, whom I normally enjoy, was so miserable in this role. The manic presentation of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so uncomfortably ungrateful that it is almost criminal. His turn, groans, grimaces, and histrionics give us no reason to look after his character, except for a single-cartoon character. The director must have believed that the fast movements, the dialogue screaming and "" the paper had a resemblance to the comedy. Apparently he told every participant to act like he had red ants in his pants. The error must be accompanied by the carved irresponsible scenario. I think the writer used "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world" as an example of a comedy scene. As manic as 1963 classic is, it is far superior to this clapper - in fact - suddenly looks pretty good in comparison. What's sad about this movie is that it must have been apparently written to appeal to young children. I'm not sure whose child was created. Surely I do not know any respectable child with business cards! If they had to remember "my favorite Martian," why did not they add a timeless charm to the original classic? Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not consider "zero" as an assessment for its readers, which is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this transvestity. A good thing came from this movie, the actors and the crew were paid - I think.
