If it was not about Barry Diamond and Art Evans's performances as flawless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone. The plot is centered around a 10-year high-school reunion that takes place in a supposedly abandoned lyceum (looks more like a proposal from a 1950s shock shot), and the upset pupil of the class drew a joke very traumatic. This student wants to kill the entire class for revenge. John Hughes falls in love with his characters too, because only a student is killed, as well as the late lady (Anon Ramsey). We are led to believe that the horny couple is killed, but never sees a blasted thing! This is a horrible film that continued the downward spiral of the National Lampoon in the 1980s and 1990s.
