Did anyone want to really follow this RUBBISH if it did not contain little kids running around the nude? From the cinematographic point of view, it is probably one of the most serious films I have ever seen. Some pervas were one day and they thought I would make a film with little girls and I would call it art, I'll stick them in the countryside, and there's no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or which do not appear to live anywhere or to have parents, because p * rn movies do not need that. I would comment on the rest of the movie, but I did not check the spoilers, so I'm just saying to avoid, avoid avoiding and find a movie to watch
