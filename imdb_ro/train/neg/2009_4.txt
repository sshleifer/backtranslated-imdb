This is not a totally bad movie. The plot (a new house built next to it seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is pretty creepy, and the drive is okay. The big problem that I had was that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not go over how different she looks with her seemingly new, big lips. I kept looking at them. They look so neat on her face! They make it look completely different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim, the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (like Col) is also pretty good (but those lips!) As owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is properly made of wood. The different characters living in the house were also good. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first to move home. The attempt to get involved in the general atmosphere of the neighborhood fails unfortunately, because the other neighbors are not particularly sympathetic. For some reason, the director has failed to turn the "haunted" house into a particularly threatening situation. Other movies (like Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to get that scary sense, but it does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints a description of the house. Another thing that did not work for me is the story of the plot that appears with Kim, the architect. Initially, he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (he sucks to inspiration), but later he seems to unite his forces with him. In general, it is not bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off your big lips!
