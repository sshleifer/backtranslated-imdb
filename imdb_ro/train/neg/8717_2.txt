This is one of the most hilarious films I've ever had the privilege of seeing. I saw this on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night and we just could not stop laughing from the beginning. The story is quite simple: the terrorists hijack a convoy they think they wear a uranium of weapons, but they actually carry a bunch of dinosaurs that eat man. Easy mistake to do. Cue an incompetent incompetent team of special army forces to address prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the action "Smell the Fart", as Joey claims in Friends. There are a lot of gore and a lot of shooting but, unfortunately, Rance's team seems to have a problem targeting their weapons in the general direction of a hordes of gigantic, strange monsters. Also, the lights always seem to blink and come out whenever a Velociraptor attacks (perhaps we can not see how bad the effects of the creature are). After I said all this, we all had a lot of fun bet that he was going to take his bite head off. As a Jusassic Park / Aliens adventure action action this movie smells worse than a dinosaur leg, but as ridiculous, language-in-cheek entertainment is a cursed success.
