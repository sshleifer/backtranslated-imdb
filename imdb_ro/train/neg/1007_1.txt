I found it very difficult to look at it after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before turning it off and looking at Monster House (which, by the way, is very fun). The story has massive holes in it. The plot line is extraordinarily pronounced and boring, the act is terrible, especially from Justin TImberlake, who should really stay with what is good to him (looking for daring and singing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he was danced around rock music for no apparent reason halfway through the film after him and Timberlake. Freeman and Timberlake's characters seem to have a kind of father / son relationship or something similar that simply is not obvious at all, except that; although Freeman's character seems to have only contempt for Timberlake's ignorant and rather stupid character, he never takes all stops to help him discover a completely ridiculous hiding. an incredible suspension of mistrust to give some credit to the story line, which is simply absurd and blown out of any proportion. Do not look at this movie, it's a pure waste of time.
