Before watching this movie, I read a review here stating that this movie could be one of the best movies ever! ha ha Stage scene tension increases well ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From the little girl talking gabberish and trying to drown the boy, the killer running without any notice (and who was the beach guy talking to the boy?) .. things seem to happen and then go unanswered in this movie. As I looked, it seemed to me that the movie is heading in one direction, then it does not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and beyond ... The actor is great, but the writing is horrible. Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic, and the reactions of colleagues / extras are simply strange. There are no solutions to the issues developed throughout the film, which makes confusion and, ultimately, a great waste of time.
