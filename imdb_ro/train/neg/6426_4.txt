I found the documentary entitled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control as a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his service, showing a joyful love and joy for his job. The sad part, I have to say, should be the subjects in which these individuals have worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, after which they became boring and long-lasting. The film was shot in a very creative way. I really enjoyed the film of one thing, with a double voice of another. He played excellent and coincided with music.
