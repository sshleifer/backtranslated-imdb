How is it possible that such a bad movie can be made? Bad is acting. The wrong script. Just an embarrassment around. This is just one bad clich√© after another. This movie has really big stars in it. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. This movie made almost no money for a good reason. The cowboy black film call is not there. It's a shame they did not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some great stars in it. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors.
