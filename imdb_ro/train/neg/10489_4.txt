I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels, and if GOMENA TOM`S MIDNIGHT is typical of her work she probably would have little interest in her books as a child. When I was a child, I did not care if I did not have soldiers fighting full monsters with a large number of cadres. Judging from this version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I think Pearce writes for lower middle-class children because much of the story revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving into a home without a garden, then suddenly finding a metaphysics. Having a private garden was undoubtedly something that class-workers did not have in the 1950s, so I think there is somewhere a subtext of a political class. There is also a love affair involving a young girl called Hattie, but again are cynical children dazed by love stories? Perhaps the most serious criticism is that very little excitement or adventure happens within the narrative. This is a movie for children that seems dated to its source. It's harmless, but I'm surprised by her high rating by IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given so many high marks if they were 10 years old who just saw the Lord's trilogy?
