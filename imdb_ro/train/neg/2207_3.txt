Hammerhead is a combination of crazy scientists and the genres of murderous shark films. In a little casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the crazy scientist above, who develops a human shark creature / Hammerhead. Bizarre, this being is, in fact, his son, which he turned into this monster to prevent him from cancer. Or something. A group of associates are invited to the private island of the scientist. They come to be used as shark bait or shark. For unknown reasons, the IT chief was brought up as part of this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he turns out to be a hero full of resources if he is somewhat overweight, Ramboesque. I work on the assumption that he learned how to handle an assault rifle in his day-to-day work that worked first. A typical day for this IT man probably involves setting up a person's network connection, followed by a call to throw burglars out of harm. Or maybe a call to solve someone's PC has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with human-shark sharks? Anyway, it's great and saves the day. He's even the girl. <br /> <br /> Shark-man is a little sloppy creation, but OK, I think, judging by the effects in general in this movie. And the movie is moving at a decent pace. It's a complete hokum, of course, but if you bought a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a killer fish offshore, then you really do not have blame, but you. As it is, there are guns, ghosts, girls and even an exploding helicopter. They're garbage, but not as bad as some could say.
