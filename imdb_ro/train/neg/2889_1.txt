The case is the best part of the movie, but the only one is not worth the purchase price. I was expecting a movie "Based on the true story" just to find a chance in the home video, badly shot clips, tied together with pathetic accusatory scenes and related to the slaughterhouse. Video scenes have had many situations that were probably used to extend the length of the features rather than the effects. I started this review before it was just halfway through the movie and I waited until it was finished only if it had a better end, but it fell and it looked like it was bad. If I could mark it less, it would have been ten negative. You learn by my mistake and save your money and time with that.
