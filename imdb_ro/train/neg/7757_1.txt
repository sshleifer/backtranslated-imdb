I have some advice for those who made this movie, if you make such a movie, be sure you got f / x to support it. Also, you do not get a bunch of actors from the list to play in it. Another thing, we almost all saw Jurassic Park, so do not copy it blatantly. All in all this film sucks, f / x suck, acts sucking, uniginal story. Let's talk about acting for just one second, the Carradine guy, the career that culminated in 1984 when he did "The Revenge of the Nerez" (which was actually a big comedy). It's not exactly the list, it can work. He should have said not this bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after the "Jedi Return" and walk quietly in the night. He made his mark as "Nerd" and should have been like that. I understand he has bills to pay for, but it's hard to excuse this bag. Did I call this movie yet? O.K. I just wanted to be sure. If it sounds a little hostile, I apologize. I lost only 2 hours of my life, I could have spent something productive like painting paint and I felt cheated. I'll end that note. Thanks for your time.
