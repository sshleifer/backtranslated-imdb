I suppose if you like the endless dialogue that does not transmit the story and brilliant effects of the camera, such as stage transitions in the television show _Angel_, you will enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a beautiful and tight story and she was not there. Pacing was basically back, park points were buried under a great deal of useless dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of horror or tension or anything. Is Wendigo? No, he's a speed cameraman. It's not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like those commentators in front of me, I noticed that the movie invokes ridiculous laughter from the audience to the end. Horrible movie.
