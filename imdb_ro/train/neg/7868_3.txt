I've seen many of Guy Maddin's movies and I liked most, but that gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is too frantic and, apart from a power-up sequence that shows a line of heads that lean toward an object, does not interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it looked more brutal than Maddin's works - though his films always had dark elements, character sympathy gave the movies a supreme feeling of humanity. This seemed more like hardness for harsh sake. Because I have to add several lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I will mention that the actor "Guy Maddin" fails to enlarge his facial expression quite well.
