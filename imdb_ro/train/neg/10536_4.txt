William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director / writer credit for this low-budget entertainment movie, about three boys sitting in the woods with their horror magazines. Fire-backed legs and banter school back and forth ... and a scroungy tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from Leatherface's fame) wanders and sells four gore stories in exchange for food and heat of fire. A story is the old retreat of "The Hook," two teenagers on the beloved band attacked by a demented killer with a hook for one hand. Another story has some tokers that need a score. They meet a guy who knows a guy who has something great. As the pair smokes a pair of bags, the skin begins to become gray and green before it bubbles up and falls. One of the best stories is about an unfortunate man who returns home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to fall dead and is glad to tell his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth story about campfire is a glutinous sailor who washes the mad coast on an empty treasure chest and ends up being sold to the sea by zombies. Without a great budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point over and really could have been a lot worse. A little weird, but fun to notice, except perhaps the sailor. The actor does not agree. Members of the film include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
