I really liked to like The Book of Pillow. The intriguing story, the contour of the interesting character, Ewan MacGregor in the glorious total. Unfortunately, I hated every minute. Greenaway was so fond of presenting the film uniquely, and not for the benefit of the film. I will not even get into Vivian Wu's will. Have fun with the story with 4 billion windows and calligraphy that roll down at the bottom of the screen, showing the lyrics of the music being played. It seems to have lost sight of the real storytelling and the development of the plot and was embarrassed with foo-foo ornaments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in a Hallmark chit frame that says "GRANDMA loves me!" in large shining letters. This movie seems to be an accident of the director's ego instead of what could have been - disturbing and terribly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?), It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it is best demoted to plastic arts classes that are taken too seriously.
