Everything about this movie is washing the pig. Affirmative actor, horrible dialogue, nasty nasty girls. this movie sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what's going on. The kids in college are the worst. No talent in acting, very bad reasoning and just dumb straight. The special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the toy field: with forgotten weapons in the heart, walking discs that are useless; and an IT system that is classified with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential customers until everything is complete. writers should be the first victims of misery along with producers and crew. The whole movie belongs to a septic tank shot on another planet for viewing. What a jewel. Convince should look at it to commit suicide.
