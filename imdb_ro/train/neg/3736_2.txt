This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Robin Williams plays the role of a rhinoceros that fits into a tutu, even if his performance was still pitiful. Kurt Russell was more credible, but it was terrible. Plot left much to be desired, and the rest of the acting was also terrible. The only thing this movie had was the trailer, who cheated me to lose 90 minutes of my life that could have been better spent trying to lick my head. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favored and burning movie if you have it. If not, be happy not to.
