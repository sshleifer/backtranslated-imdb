These are Stallone movies that I like, but this movie has not kept my expectations low. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists crashing into the wilderness are ready to survive for at least two days. Also in all this wilderness, Stallone and the company continue to run on decks and stairs that offer conventional short-term devices or plotting devices. Also, treasury officers do not seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, the bad guys who could not hit the side of a barn with really high-tech automatic weapons. I really liked John Lithgow's negativity, but the character is such a complete psychopath that you would not take care of any of his villains or be killed. Eventually I just could not believe her character. It's not worth the price of a rental, it's not even worth the time to look.
