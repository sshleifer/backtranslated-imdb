This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise ever did. I was a kid when it came out and I still thought it was bad, even though I liked the original cartoon. There is such a scene that I remember when the monkey-type mafia explains to her minions what rhetorical questions you are. It's terrible. Many fans hate the series for including a turtle, but that did not bother me. So much so that I did not even remember it until I had recently read the show. It is generally miserable. The only good thing was the theme of the song. The guilty pleasure they call ... Nananana ninja ...
