Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and is not called Topper? Go figure! This travesty makes a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays it is young versus old, blonde, white-haired men and killing people as they pull the gun out of their hands. The true Hopalong will lift you! One of the worst movies ever made and, believe it or not, the person who brought us the grandfather's saga!
