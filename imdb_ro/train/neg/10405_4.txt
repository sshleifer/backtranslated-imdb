The fourth feature "Tremors" returns in time, until 1889. "Legend begins" in the small town "Perfection", which was then "Rebellion, Nevada". As the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by "Gardens". Some characters in today's Tremors have previously had ancestors, both figurative and literal. The most obvious is Michael Gross, returning (like Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is helpless with firearms; so he employs Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot "Dirt Dragons". This takes something ordinary - as happens in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original monster of the "Graboids" movie. These "dragons of dirt" are not even terrified as their counterparts "Tremors" (1990). Consequently, in this film, the characters spend a lot of time on the field, which would not have happened in the original movie. And it was strange for citizens to quit fighting so quickly when Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did not Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) do it immediately to gather people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> Tremori 4: Legend begins (2004) S.S.
