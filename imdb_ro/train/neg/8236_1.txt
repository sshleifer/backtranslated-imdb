I can not believe it's on DVD. Even less was available at my local movie store. Some claim that this is a good movie if you consider that it only had a $ 4,000 budget. I find it funny. I would be very sorry, regardless of budget. Even more funny, I read the following in another review: "Dragons aside, if you like horror and you like something along the lines of Duel (1971) updated with a little more story and some beautiful girls thrown in, you will liked this movie. "What ?! This is a shame that compares the two films. I gave a "1" because I can not give a "0". I do not see any way that this movie could be fun.
