I chose this cover movie, which was a bad move. It was not funny at all, and the main characters were unpleasant. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. It had nothing to do with navigation. Worry movie with a surfing theme that has nothing to do with surfing or real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a rebirth just because she is now in the limelight, being married to Gordon Gekko and everyone, but if you have not seen that you do not waste your time. A bad movie with GREAT surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING cinema, THE BEAUTIFUL was in God's hands.
