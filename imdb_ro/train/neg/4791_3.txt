* noises * do not read further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Lift up after depression "Phantasm II" is over; The tall man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and the new baby Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to bring him back and do not get into the slaves on Red Planet. This is really bad: the thrill trio in the pink-lighted meat was just there for comic amusement, and the black karate chickens (they do not remember the name) was so irritating that I did not wait to see if the man was tall They. This makes him look almost like Tim's character, who comes late and eventually is the hero, but ... it does not work that way. By the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by murderers, Mike gets a silver sphere implanted in his skull, the spheres help Reggie and the dwarves to receive Tim, and there's no one left to stop The Tall Man. The bad boy wins - now how is that for a surprising twist at the end? It was filmed in 1993 and released until '95, and its ending was at the end and, although disappointing and anticlimactic, it was also a fitting and fitting end for this strange little series. But the fourth changes this end and does not add new jokes, but worse, and a worse and worse ending and meaningless ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
