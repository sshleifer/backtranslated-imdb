I was so disappointed in this movie. I do not know much about the true story, so I was eager to see it playing in the movie and educating me about a little piece of history. With such a powerful story and great actors, it seemed like a safe combination. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so scattered - is this movie about childhood? his love life? his own disability? his ability to speak? his passion for people with disabilities? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all these things into a good story, but this movie was not like that. I stayed cold by observing characters who could not decouple because of their disability, but because of their personality. Other small precipices: 1. Soundtrack hard to handle. It is the seventy - we stand! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why did not we treat more than a fragment here and there - and even then, especially in assemblies?
