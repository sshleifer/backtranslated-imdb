::: Soooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobedience, he was sent to jail (or rather a kind of work camp). He escapes, but after a short while he is caught again. This time ends in a reality show in which he is supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die. But we all know Arnie and we all know he's tougher than even the toughest of hard boys. I really wanted to like this movie, being a fan of Arnie and everything. However, "The Running Man" contains too many defects that really bother the bullshit in me. E.g. Reconstruction of Arnie's struggle inside the helicopter, if the shocked audience presents a brief summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter Arnie flew was equipped with nearly 10 cameras filming crew members, one of them being one of the crew members, Arnie, beating. There are other defects, and the plot, which theoretically seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then generates a pool of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. The actor can not be said to be anything better than under the hair, with Arnie in the lead role, making Arnie's average performance. The rest of the camp comes without being particularly good or bad. The special effects are OK, without being impressive.
