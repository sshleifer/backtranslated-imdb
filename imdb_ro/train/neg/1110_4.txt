One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this move, and I decided it was pretty limp. That was after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) painted his horse from a tree to return to good posse posse. I was quite deceived by the whole thing at Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20, which did not translate into anything. Obviously, the name Coppola in Credits could not do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed. If you have reached the end of the movie, you probably have finished asking yourself the same questions we have done. What exactly was the gloves hook? What about the rodeo script? Who was the Stranger Should Represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> We could go further, but my energy was drained. Look, there's already a vest called "The Gunfighter" in 1950, with a guy named Gregory Peck as a title character. By watching her, you will make yourself feel as good as when you forget that you feel bad. That's what I can recommend.
