I do not know why this behavior has ever been tolerated in the movie business! This movie (short) is gross (at least)! There's a bunch of 5-7-year-olds who wear big-diaper nappies, acting like adults (and too much!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example in which "old days" may not have been so good after all! (Thank God we have laws against this type of material now!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short one from "Shirley Temple Festival"}
