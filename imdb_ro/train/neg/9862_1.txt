I could not believe when I put this movie on the DVD player. I thought I would be a good laugh since I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn it off as I had a company, and they wondered what the bullshit I was following. I finished it later and I should have let her go to the gay clown porn with the soft core beginning. No, they are running jokes of jokes, jokes, incest, racism, dressing as KKK ... This movie is out of any person who ever played D & D. No wonder Real D & D shows them let him use his game. Who would like the name attached to that?
