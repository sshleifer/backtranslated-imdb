Did I see this on TV last night? or rather I went across a channel so often to watch infomercials when I could no longer follow it. It was bad. Really, very bad. Not "so bad is good", just bad bad. How was it funded? Who thinks this is a good idea? A friend of mine actor did an audition and was told he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think they meant to say it was "save and run out of this group of steam @ $% ". I bet the rest of the cast has received the option. To be fair, the act was hard to judge because of the angry upsets of the Americans. The photo was dullllllllllll. The action was strange and embarrassing. The dialogue was inhuman. The saddest thing was the ship. In real life, the Interislander ferry is a foul boat and the film does not clean well. Instead of trying to make it look like a new crew hatch, with ribbon pieces wrapped around prayer polls, you did not suspect, could have changed the script to explain or even celebrate blackmail. GOD, GOD, GOD. Do not watch this movie, not even as a joke.
