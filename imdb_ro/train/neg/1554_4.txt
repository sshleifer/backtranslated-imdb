Cannon has brought out a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that looks fascinating (except the dragon). Now how did the long-known studio know for Chuck Norris movies with a lack of knowledge first? The case in question: amateur behavior and horrible plot is a sign that the revival of the medieval legend is not a remedy for an unpleasant execution. They actually went and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of candymen invited, just to make this look even better. For the two "barbarian brothers," they certainly know how to make strange noises than to become warriors so powerful and daring to save their native land. This is the biggest loss of potential I've seen from an "expensive" movie with a low budget and even worse to leave a miniature ax shot. All this followed an advertising campaign selling barbarian T-shirts! The film alone makes a big souvenir!
