A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells about a first woman who ever went through the SEAL emergency training. Training is the most difficult and difficult to accomplish, as the instructor says in the movie star O'Neil starring Demi Moore. There is no message or special point in this movie or I could not get to it properly. It can be a kind of statement of women's rights and abilities, but they all sink under tired scenes and bad gun fighting at the end of the movie. I really do not understand why Ridley uses so much bet in that fight with the last gun in the desert? It looks so bad and irritating and almost amateur, so I would love to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in battle scenes (which are many) and they are very intense and skillful. The whole final of the GI. Jane looks ugly and there is nothing more than filming and stupid and brainless murder. This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known. However, I'm glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still some great scenes and samples of Scott's skills, but there are very few in this movie. A disappointment and nothing compared to the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on) of this talented director. So I'm forced to give it to G.I. Jane 4/10.
