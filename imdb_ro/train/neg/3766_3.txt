I went into watching this movie knowing it would not be great. but what we witnessed was terrible for words. I do not want to be harsh, just the movie was terrible. generally had bad, I mean special effects AWFUL, the act was not too bad, but it was neither good, and sasquatch himself was like .... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion, the best Sasquatch movie is Harry and Henderson. not violent or horrible, but has the best description of sasquatch. at least one suit, and not a rip-off. watch this movie only if you are desperate or really appreciate someone in the movie. or go to the saint boondock watch, it is MORE better.
