and a $ 30,000 budget and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. You can find out from the first frame to the last, that he did not care about the continuity of the movie or about the plot, he was very happy to make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What shows the end result is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It would have been great if he had to take care. The end result is endless zooming on badly made gorons and even less poorly developed metal over it. What happens when you combine great hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and one idiot behind the room.
