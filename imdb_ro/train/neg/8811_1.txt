SPOILERII !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I watched half of this movie and I do not like it. <br /> <br /> The first reason: Bored. Almost nothing happens, women are around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, smokes weeds, read magazines, care for their sick boyfriend, and cuts off the occasional body. FOOD !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: There are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, holds them in a chair, and interrogates them. Who are these people? How do I know about illegal activity against those who suffer from sick meat? Why kill one and let another go? There is also this guy who thought at first that he had the meat eating the disease, but he put his fist through a wall with superhuman power, suggesting that it was not enough what I originally thought - he never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: We found the annoying women, the uninteresting story, the boring duology, and the nonexistent action. Also, the art of coating is misleading because it makes you think that this film will be cool when obviously not. I hired this movie based on reviews made by others on this site, and although we respect that some people might have enjoyed this movie, from now on, I assure you that I have read more than two reviews in one film to avoid hiring another movie I regret to see.
