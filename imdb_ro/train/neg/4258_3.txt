I would give this movie 5, rather than 3, if it were at least in time ... When I first saw it, it was just what you could expect from work that is based not on artistic skills of the directors but idealistic or I would rather say the idiotic customs of our government (Kazakhstan) ... It is a shame because "Qazaqfil'm" shot beautiful films when he was not honored by Shaken Aimanov's name, but it was actually ran away from him. Movies like "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after Mr Aimanov's death, the production of quality films fell almost dramatically in 10 years, when very few films were produced. However, in the late 1980s, "Assa" was shot, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in the big country, a year later, Rashid Nugmanov made another film with the co-star of the same actor, at that time was already a Soviet / Russian rock legend - the movie called "Igla" (Acul or something) was completely new, someone called that period as a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie. Unfortunately, we do not have quality films nowadays, our directors filming films on French and Japanese financial support, and so movies are not for the public, but for professional critics, some of them take a price at international film festivals, but there few of them become a product of business goods ... And again back to our "new". Such films are usually unpopular because of a lot of issues. The same effects were with Nikita Mikhalkov's "Sibirski Cyrilnik" on the Russians, who were shot and parted with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in the Russian audience he became the main subject of comedians and comedy shows, such as "KVN". From my point of view
