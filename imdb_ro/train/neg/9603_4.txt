"A young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf, based on a family legend of an ancestor accused and murdered because she was one. Due to her treatment by men, she travels to the countryside seducting and killing the men she encounters Making herself in love with a good man, her life seems to be better when she is raped and her boyfriend is killed by a band of criminals. Traumatized again by these recent events, the woman turns her violent ways and seeks revenge on thieves, "according to the DVD sleeve summary. <br /> <br /> "Rino Di Silvestro's La Manna Lupa" begins with a fearful, fearsome, fearful dance by blonde blonde Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly thinks she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera captures the background fire between her legs. The opening of the "flashback" reveals that her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. Mrs. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she is just a very powerful madman. As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" (in English) would have been better if Borel's character was indeed a female werewolf; with her sexual victimization much of the characterization. But, until the 1970s, skin and blood films go, this is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexless dressed in the whole movie, which has a fair amount of free gore. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and Howard Ross (as Luke) are good support players.
