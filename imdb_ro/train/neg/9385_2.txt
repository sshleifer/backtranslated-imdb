The "Trivia" page on IMDb claims film makers have protested because this movie was re-cut by the studio to "simplify the plot". If so, this effort was a total failure, because this is one of the most incoherent narratives I've ever seen in a movie - I would have liked to have seen it before the plot was "simplified." It's sad to see Warren so low that he can not do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in the 1970s style instead of the glamorous gown and Hollywood personality, but it's sad to see her suddenly wandering through this wife's wife. Actually, it would be later to join and marry the director, instead - who, to remark, never directed anything, but did strictly the first or second year of work on television here. That's what I'm telling you pretty well there. I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic boldness for American films of this period, and this role adds a perspective to Oates's fantastic (1972) The Hired Hand. But "the 1940s detective as a fish off the water in the 1970s," the theme, which is the only thing the movie really has to say, is sold in a way too hard to handle. A similar theme would have been treated much more effectively two years later in Altman's Long Goodbye. And, as Oates played a hard-biting guy on a despised commission, three years ago, he would give his definitive performance to "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia." If you have not seen them, do not waste your time with this!
