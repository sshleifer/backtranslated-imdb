He saw someone else whenever they're in the car each time the camera has a new angle that the roads change. As in one scene, it is a residential area with sidewalks, then on a multi-lane highway with a divisor, following a two-lane country road with double yellow strips. I can understand a low budget, but that was just puzzled movie work. I also read the other reviews and I do not agree that it was a bad movie. I think if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, then you can enjoy this movie. If, however, you find her / is not funny, I would recommend you stay away from it.
