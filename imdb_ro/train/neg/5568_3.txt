Dolph Lundgren plays the role of a former cop / boxer looking for Boston's scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought out in the community, yet he learned how his brother enjoyed pangs and that a serial killer it's the fault. Dolph Lundgren is really good in this movie, in fact, based on his performance here, he would look Lundgren to grow to fame involving acting roles. That said the material does not give Lundgren anything to do, in fact, Lundgren is completely left to dry in a disturbing thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact, the movie works best when it focuses around Lundgren's and Brett's chemistry, indeed the movie took time to explore their relationship the film would have been pretty of decent. However, the film is devoid of scope, the action is non-existent, the plot has not been explored enough (too boring around Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer), and the film is useless of cumbersome and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually very good (as is the newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film only cuts from one sequence to another, which makes this film particularly disappointing. If anything, however, shows how underrated Lundgren is as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4 (Poor)
