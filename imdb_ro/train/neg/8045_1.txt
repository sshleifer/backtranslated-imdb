I'm so confused. In what world was this movie? What was the killer's motivation? He seemed quite upset, but I still did not realize why. Nothing in this movie made sense. It has zero depth. Or depth less than zero. What I think would make a hill. Or a bunch. Shit. The act was horrible. When I looked for some of the actors in this movie, there were very few things I heard about and that was not surprising at all. I can not decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in such a bad movie or to feel that they should never be offered another job. Starting. . . NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) Really, however, do not waste time with this. There is so little substance that there is nothing right there to have fun. It was undoubtedly one of the worst blows - NO, one of the worst movies of any guy, that we've ever had the misfortune to track and we've seen quite a lot.
