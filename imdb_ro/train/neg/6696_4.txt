(There are Spoilers) Miya, Kari Wuhrer, murdered Nymphomaniac, take over the life and car of 18 virgins, even if it is too embarrassed to admit it, the collage of Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the movie, Myia not only hijacked, but gave a healthy and innocent cake a lesson on how to find a dangerous job and stay so far for him or her to avoid turns into one. Suspending around a rest trucker Miya is taken over by Roy, Burt Young, for a hot and heavy action on the back seat of his buggy. Roy is too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is none other than his estranged daughter! Disappointed that Miya is reluctant to use it, Roy almost suffocates to death just to be interrupted by spring colt student Trent Colbert, who drops into the rest zone, pushing one of the drivers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance, Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two are stopped in what turns out to be the weirdest chase of a car ever put into a movie. Going across all the northeastern US regions, the two of them get involved in a truck, destroy a crime and a firefight with the state band that then leads Trent's parents home, being hostages. There is another wild blow between crazy Miya and an entire SWAT team backed by local police and state troops. <br /> <br /> You'd expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be deliberately or unintentionally funny, but it's not. In fact, the movie is very disturbing in the way Miya treats everyone in the movie that she comes in contact with her parent Roy, perverted and heir to the children. Taking Trent to run her all over North East Michaels makes poor baby be drunk with him in a motel room with shackles and a candle lit. Miya also takes her with the owner of the horrified motel, Mr. Foster, pulling him in to give his gun as part of a strange game of sex. After holding Foster, she took it with Trent, who chilled his motel room with a $ 400.00 wallet in it, but he does not get used to his car. <br /> <br /> The need for money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent receives a call to his mobile phone from Miya to pick her up at a local dinner to get the money back. Like the bastard that Trent takes Miya, who is now a fugitive from his law, and later with her father, Roy, on the highway as he tries to run both Trent and Miya off the road . <br /> <br /> Tracking ends in the deserted dressing room, which Roy follows Miya, running on a muddy, high-heeled road, his own rifle. Roy was so busy trying to pull off his trousers that he forgot that he left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With both a bite and a crime, as well as a blow and a run, accused of them, the two desperate stop at a S & M / Tattoo boutique where Trent gathers his ear and the nose and is dressed in leather and chains by Myri, along with a collar of his and his dog. This to meet loving and conservative parents for Thanksgiving. <br /> <br /> Having a shootout with the state band, one of them ending up badly, the two fugitives in law arrive at Trent's parents, Mr. & Mrs Colbet, David Keith & Elaine Martyn at home with the entire local police force, with a SWAT team waiting there. Unusual movie, with a really final final, which has made you wonder exactly what the movie was trying, if it is not, to tell the audience. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first, but as the film rolled to the end of it, it evaporated as fast as an ice chicken tray in the Death Valley. Even though Roy was the most untouchable person in the movie at first, until the movie ended, Miya completely eclipsed.
