Also included are unrealistic film spoilers. From real life experiences, this movie has continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I am currently deployed on my second tour in Iraq as an infantryman. This film has nothing close to what would happen in real-life events. From the beginning, let's name a few: the bomb carriage, the EOD elements that ran solo without escorts, the EOD staff sergeant sneaking from the VBC, with the sleeves twisted all the time in the ACU, where I had to tell him to stop 2 dollar copy haji, the sniper scene. The list will continue, however, it is useless to display random mistakes with a duration of 2 minutes before several things are incorrect; and this point has been made. This movie is for people and critics to watch that they have no understanding or experience with deployments or military. Experienced military personnel or army knowledge will be disappointed by inaccuracies.
