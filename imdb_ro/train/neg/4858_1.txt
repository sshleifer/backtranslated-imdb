Why would anyone do this garbage in the world? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were pretty stupid, but this takes cake for the worst trilogy (Probably of all time). Todd Sheets is still the director, but he is no longer the screenwriter, who is not negative or positive, considering he is as untouched as the writer. Writing is based too much on the word f, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times to nausea. The act is roughly the same as the last two Bloodbath films, so of course they are some of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than those in the last two, but they still seem bold. The plan has become too complicated for its own sake, and it was a government experiment that went badly and a zombie was produced. Also, there is a cryogenic mutant zombie and school children who know how to travel in time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie, it goes to outtakes, which is weird, because the whole movie is an exit. Just see this to have fun, because if you enter this with a serious mind, you could kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
