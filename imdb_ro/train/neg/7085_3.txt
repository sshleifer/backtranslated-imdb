I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction. In this story, we learn that you can lose everything when you are sex addicted. In this case, the main character and our hero, in order to have a non-stop sex with all sorts of women (crazy, bastard, neurotic) jeopardizes marriage, work and even his life. production values ​​are terrible; especially the act. Oh, you will not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are very poor and you might think you are looking at a home made. <br /> <br /> Second, sense. How could such an intelligent and beautiful wife be able to master all the ugly things of her husband? How could he believe it ?! The situation in three situations is invaluable and will make you laugh for a while. Also, the scene with the black film theater attendant is just useless and will let you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like those you'll find a lot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid; it's not a soft core, it's not a documentary document, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a pretentious effort made up of the so-called documentary director or anything else. Only Mrs Kinski's feet on the screen deserve the clock. I caught HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money. But the 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
