It has been hidden for a few years or so. I've never been moved to post here before, so maybe this movie deserves a star for that, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD after I lost it in movies because of the disease and I've never been able to see it before. I have not read extensively about it, I certainly did not even think about the movie in a few months. It was exactly what her boyfriend took in the store, so she was followed. Wrong error. The success I spoke in the summary is in the trailer and on the poster. Right from the beginning, Jason Statham has his hair. Like not another GR movie. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta in panties should be warned in advance. It's scary and funny, but not ha ha-humor. It is more in a way almost theOffice-but-slightly-moved-and-so-bankruptcy-sort-of-humor. Each of them says the same thing: "This movie is not like you expect this movie to be." Now, relying on a previous and extensive viewing experience of movies, I expected this movie to be a few things. Search for: () Coherent, () Interesting or engaged, () It is not a complete and complete look of shadows, <() Something more substantial than a bunch of evil fables made out of what is just an Eastern mystical standard ideology , dressed as a "cool, modern, self-conscious form of art," <br /> () We hope it's better than "Idiot." As you probably guessed through my tone, it's totally failed to tick a box above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Edit stupidly (the rhythm across the store, 70s amateur sea-8 pieces of leaps, incomprehensible "plot" "twisted !!!" (x) Shot as if it were a 14-year-old depressed gothic who just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with the curtains attracted <br /> <br /> (x) So until her back with the whole "I am very smart, I" reason / message, that he feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that the dissatisfied people (ie all who do not like) in audience ensures that they get the point of view, (x) A real loss of my time. <br /> <br /> As for the indisputable ability of some people to "get" something from that, well. I'm happy that you liked it. A poster told me something that caught my attention: under 25 years she probably got it better because of editing. Perhaps editing should make work more accessible, not less. Regarding "Genius is only recognized by the lighted brigade," go to suck an onion and grow up. There is nothing more presumptuous and deceptive than people who say that the reason why another person does not know a great art is that they do not understand the "handicraft / materials / moon / filaments of supreme rational thinking" that "the auteur / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot scientist "uses to explain his / her / grand-schema / unit with Gaea / big bucket of dog sick". For me and many, many more people, garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, anything else designed to be seen by another man should engage and move. In a certain direction, be metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have. The only way I was moving was ahead in time, two hours closer to my inevitable death. "The biggest trick he ever fired made you think Any part of this movie meant nothing at all." And now, please, by all means, bring my toast to me.
