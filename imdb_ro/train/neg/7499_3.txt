John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a Latino in New York, able to enter into countless characters, both men and women, to show the bizarre fake of an ethnic group trying to handle an alien culture.

Every scene in which he interacts with his "Gumbas" rings is false, as if he were lost from a "West Side Story" college production, while the others made a low-cost "Mean Streets". This is one problem with this evil, mischievous move. Spike blew this big moment. Btw, CBGBOMFUG means "Country, Bluegrass, Blues and other gourmet music [or possibly gourmets] Ask Hilly Crystal who founded the club. <br /> <br />
