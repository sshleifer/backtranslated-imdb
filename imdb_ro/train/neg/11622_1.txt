Dave goes through a divorce and his mind returns to his first love. "Wanders" is not likely the word. I should say he hangs on his last girlfriend. She remembers the day when the relationship is over. Dream sequences have only troublesome transitions. He remembers with pleasure their favorite tunes and places. I'm not a counselor, but maybe that's about the failed marriage? Dave goes to a support group and meets a half-year-old lady (divorced) who, instead of being "stopped" by his anger, begins to become interested in him. Did I tell you how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he goes. It's weird. Over a brief short story, Dave is complaining to hunt Mary (the old galician friend) and kill her ... er ... I want to face her. He does that. Who was really creepy. He thinks she's married, but he's still flying halfway across the country to meet her. She borrows her house to make sure she's alone before she's "down" on her. He has a strange conversation with her, ending with sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the film especially for an unintentional comedy value. I still enjoyed my wife with my impressions Dave .... "I heard another song Dave & Mary!"
