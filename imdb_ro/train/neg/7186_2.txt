I'm sorry for all fans, but this is a useless movie. The actor is bad, even from wood, over-hype the fear factor from the beginning and does not work exactly. I think it should have been a twist at the end, but it just got to be mad confused. What the hell? The guy who kills everyone was one of the hunters? Try again. It's hard to be original and not as good as a straight slash. And that says something. I think anyone who did the writing, anyone who wrote the script and anyone who thought about this concept should be ruthlessly drawn and deported. this movie. If someone puts it at a party, throw the disc out of the window and put a horror film, such as Silence of the Lambs or Shining Light.
