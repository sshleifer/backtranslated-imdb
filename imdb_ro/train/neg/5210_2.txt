First, let me be honest. I did not watch this whole movie. I saw the first five minutes and when I realized I almost slept, I decided to hurry and see if it was more interesting later ... It did not. This movie is just a collection of blade attempts to make a story that is already uninteresting and badly told in something that would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it's important to say that a film with weak special effects can still be good if it's done well. This movie is not and will put you in a deep sleep only if you try to see it. Finally, I feel that it's important to say that I think this movie is publicdomain, so if you feel you have to follow it all but a little search on the internet it will surely show you a place where you will not have to pay to track this pile of cinematographic trash.
