I hope to find background information about the Apollo 11 mission and what we got was a decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in mission related disaster in the worst tradition of television production. If you could cut your voice and change the rotation program in a testament positive effect on how people can overcome obstacles to achieve a goal in normal time it would have been great - but I feel I have lost about 45 minutes of my life while pursuing a program of 60 minutes. I want to return those minutes.
