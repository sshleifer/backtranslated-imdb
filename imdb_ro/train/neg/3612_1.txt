The nut is killing students, maybe the new teacher stops madness? <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not be interested. With a title like Splatter University, he admits that this film is not high art. But worse than Splatter University does not even qualify for funny trash. Splatter U is so badly done - the story is meaningless, the characters are thrown away, and the whole movie has no essence of imagination. Needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scare. This movement is not even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest emotion of all). So, around this endless infatuated weakness, there is nothing in the way of entertainment (not even laughing cheaply) and it simply becomes a complete hole. Bottom of the barrel - even fans, heavy slasher fans will want to think twice before watching, not to mention paying the money for this movie. <br /> <br /> BOMB din ****
