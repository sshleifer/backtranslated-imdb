Ye Lou Purple Butterfly's movie finds a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the Japanese forces in the torn war in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former boyfriend Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on the opposite side of the conflict after a casual encounter. I agree with the Paris reviewer. The film replaces a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single concern about the characters or their causes. The sudden change of time does not help to solve the problems, because it seems completely unjustified and unnecessary. Normally, I'm not bothered by dark movies, but the absence of light, camera shootings and the worst movies really make a tough movie to watch and stay interested. I also agree with the Georgia spectator that this movie "has a chaotic editing style and a claustrophobic cinema," but I do not think it helps the film. The film background is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century and I do not think you can do any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. Extremely melodramatic moments do not add to his attention. The actors are melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that he has an extremely limited acting while he spends the entire film doing what he seems to do best in all his films, confronting and generally outraged. However, at least she adds a certain variety to this role through smoke chains and engaging in the worst scene of love from Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. In total, a very disappointing film, especially seeing how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
