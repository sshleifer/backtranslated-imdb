I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as the star of a recent film, not just a part, made me happy. Unfortunately, I appreciated the film at college and the only thing I can say I did not like was that the movie was made in an abandoned part of the city and there was no background traffic or loose look. I have to say that the action leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to calculate it down to the wrong direction and the support piece leaves something to be desired. I love Arnold Vosloo and made the movie visible. Otherwise, I'd write it like another horrible movie. I found the scene of brutal and useless rape, but the actors who disappeared at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shooting were bad enough. There are some glitches in the movie (continuity), but they are negligible given the low film size. Generally, I liked the movie because Arnold Vosloo was in it. <br /> <br /> Jackie
