But it has a good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts as a body builder and is not so attractive, in fact, IMO, it is UGLY. (her skills are missing everything!) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character had to be developed. There are far too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action and too stupid for an end. It's very violent. However, I loved the landscape, this movie takes you all over the world and this is a bonus. I also liked how she had something about the mafia in her, not too much or too little, but enough to attract my attention. The actors had to be nicer ... My biggest problem was that Nevsky was too normal, not quite sexy. I think for most of the guys, Sascha will be pretty hot, but for us ladies who are the fans of the action, Nevsky just does not cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I did not like it or even hated it, I just found it like another normal action.
