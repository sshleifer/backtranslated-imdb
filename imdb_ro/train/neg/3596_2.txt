To be as honest as possible, the game of the devil (or the veil of blood or vampire, or the curse of the black sisters or ????) is a complete boredom. Does the film have a good premise behind it? the resurrection of a dead vampire along a descendant's body with the help and help of a group of black-haired women? but the execution is horrible. There are long, long moments of the screen when nothing happens. Characters sit around without doing anything. There is no mystery, no suspense, no point to be of interest to. The act is simply the abyss. Most of the actor involves a group of women who are dancing naked while looking at the room. They do so repeatedly. And what is a small plot seems to be designed to get more of these women less attractive so they can join the dance. While it is not as bad or useless as the dance or plot in something like the Orgy of the Dead, it is approaching.
