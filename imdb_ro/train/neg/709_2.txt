This movie was so badly written, guided and acted to ask for faith. It should be remodeled with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is driving. You have Jennifer Beals, on the one hand, polished, professional and totally credible, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is miserable and stupid in this play. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just horrifying while the servant possesses (and keeps) a couple, although both normally work well. The actors (and the director) should not have tried to make any accents at all - they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to focus on doing a good English job. Casting is ridiculous. Why the children of an "african" merchant (so socially desirable to the gens de couleur society) were thrown away with very open-skinned actors, while Marcel, socially assumed, has pronounced African features, including a blown obvious? It's as if casting executives can not be disturbed to read the script they are weighing and to choose the right actors from a large group of highly talented and physically different actors. It's so weird! This could be a great movie and should be reprofilated, but with people who respect the material and can choose the right and competent actors. There are a lot of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with a proper cast, a good script and a decent direction.
