You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not you. You believe He is the Son of God or not. The choice is up to you. Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring Jesus back to a mere historical figure, social assistant, son of two men, instead of the Son of God Holy Spirit and Mary, who opened us again to heaven. Encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film describes a theologian who brings some "modern discoveries" to the actor who plays Jesus in Passion, which incorporates them happily into his play. The descendant priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion played in Montreal is having a sexual relationship with one of the female players in Passion, instead of showing his love of God through celibacy. Most often, the directorial disgust of the Church is clearly visible. The director tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of Pasion Play actor. This is an admirable trial, but the appearance of the Resurrection by transplanting Pasion Play's organs into other bodies signifies how the director thinks of Jesus. My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I would not want to stand by the director and actors when they stood before the throne of Jesus.
