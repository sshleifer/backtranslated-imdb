this is a piece of s - t! this looks worse than the one achieved for t.v. movie. and I have the obturator to believe that a sequel was even concieved and the results ... the war is more beautiful than that. jean claude van ruam did it again and wonders why his career is where he is now. no scenario, no story, no time should be wasted on it. I want to say that. 1 out of 10 is too big, too big. goldberg should be shot for this. van shame is not an actor.
