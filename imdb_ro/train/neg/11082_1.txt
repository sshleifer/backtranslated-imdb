I know it's a Power-Rangers trick and it's been given to 7-year-olds, but why are they taking this movie seriously? If they write a plot of pencil, they will at least have the decency to make it silly. It's kind of hilarious if you look at it. We have a typical clich√© family (war veteran father who has lost his wife and blamed himself for LOLOL), airborne children trying to fill the stereotype hard, but they do not succeed with a terrible adventure and a friendly , to the film, but to fill the room space. However, the wonderful moment is coming to an end when the warrior father and the villain of the villain try to fight with the sword, but then they realize that none of them knows how to (probably because there is no budget room for choreographers) so come with this American Gladiator type setting to run around. 1/10 rating because it's trying to treat this seriously.
