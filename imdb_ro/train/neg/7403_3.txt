This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that's about what it can be said about. Start with a good atmosphere; the hospital is sterile and alienated, the mood is set to "terrible". And then ... nothing. Well, something. Only some things that are not clearly in place ... and no effort is being made to clarify the connection between strange and still not particularly intimidating creators and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker duds? Some bands looked a little too much Gwar. My personal favorite was the head demon, who looks more like a middle-aged trucker who desperately tried the threat, while showing at the same time that he would really like to go down on a sofa covered with Afghan, to loosen his belt , throw a cheap beer box (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Frankly, I saw the trucks more frightening. On trucks. Coffee band. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Scary! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more drawn, and even less scary. At least, on DVD, videos provide an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they seem to have accidentally appeared in locations, sang some "metal" and caused people to die a bit. Barring a few good special effects, and action that is not completely terrible, given the lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
