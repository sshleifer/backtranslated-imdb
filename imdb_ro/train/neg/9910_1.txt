One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, bad TV cinema, bad action. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely manage to go, not to mention the act. Lead woman Nancy Young can not act. Terrible direction. Under-hair with bad TV movies. The occasional poor jokes fall. Even the basic premise of the movie does not make sense. Somehow they should stop a wedding, but there is no logic behind their actions. The slow slowing made my wife stop, but I suffered through it. Elders should behave as if they are young and excited, but become pathetic instead of funny. How did they get the money to do that?
