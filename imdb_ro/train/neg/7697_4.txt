This mini-series is actually more fun than others, with much larger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum. If it had not been so long (almost 3 hours), I think the kids would rather not. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not much romance or other "icky" stuff. When you're young, you're not too critical for flexible rubber swords, camp actors and repetitive scenes. (At least two scenes are identical in the movie, just like in the old series to bring the audience to the fullest.) Finally, children usually accept the English-American dialogue that comes out of the mouth of Asian actors. (Not to mention that several major roles are played by non-Asian actors.) I was going to give this movie three stars, but I felt like the director, the producers and the cast deserve extra credit for doing the little of the project. This movie is not art, but, like your home painting, it actually took some time, effort and discipline to do it. Generally, it's not a recommended use for your time, but it could keep kids having fun while traveling in the mini-van. Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is your favorite and traditional spelling. Checking spells seems to believe that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
