I saw this on the shelf at the local video store, saw Coppola in credits and I was excited. This was the only time that this movie raised interest. I could never work if it was an attempt at a staggering film that failed or an attempt at a serious film that she had failed to figure out. Generally, all production seemed incredibly bitter. The sound was especially horrible, especially in scenes shot at the small bar; the dialogue was so horn in some parts was unbelievable. Very disappointing.
