I have noticed that this film has taken the toll of many insults. Probably won some of them, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I do not want to see this movie ever. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, she tried to tell a story. As a drama, this movie could work very well. I think filmmakers have mistaken the way they would take when they did it (they should have added more fun beats if they wanted to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a great movie. But, as a satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit in the context of the plot: for example, the scene of robbery does not make sense in the story. However, it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it in the Top 10 worst? That's questionable.
