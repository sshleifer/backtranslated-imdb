The Spanish painting of horror Paul Naschy sees it in this film, one of the poorest werewolf films ... but you act with me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and over the years there have been many home videos. If you want to be serious about a fair chance, the most practical edition I've seen about this is the title "THE WOLF MAN NOT SLEEPS," and it is an unprecedented and complete European version that restores some disturbing scenarios and contains the original naked photos that are missing from FURY printing. It's also with a mailbox. Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet just to find out that he has contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has an affair. He takes care of her and her boyfriend while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman and a female nurse. It seems that the dock is trying to "tame" the werewolf and there is a very weird scene of sado-masochistic love between her and Daninsky with her hair lying in the trance, at least in the original version. Finally, we have two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky fights a she-wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk and the results are really quite incoherent. When you look at the WOLF MAN NOT SLEEPS copy, it's not that difficult to find out what's going on, although editing remains atrocious in spots. The worst of all are occasional records that do not match Naschy's elderly werewolf, slipped directly from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, known as "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") and blended into it without any a reasonable reason! The wolf's clothing changes from black to white and back, just like his conduct; a moment when the wolf walks lethargic in a hypnotic trance from FURY, then roars and runs around the savage of THE POWER TERROR. Very bizarre.
