I like to see Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this bad apology for a soft porn is unnecessarily offensive, has nothing like intelligence, and serves only as a self-promotion vehicle for Springer. Even if it runs fast 90 minutes, the film is shooting in a secret way, and I should have been the good sense to go. Just atrocious.
