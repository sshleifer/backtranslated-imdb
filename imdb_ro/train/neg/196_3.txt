This movie is erroneous on many fronts. Like many before her, she describes the Alamo mythology more than history. Production is poor, generally giving the impression of a welfare project to a bunch of actors who would otherwise have had to work at Hollywood Squares. This was for me the biggest flaw - I know the ages and the general personalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of the TV actors chosen to portray them never leave any sign of credibility intrude. Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about history. I can accept decent production from both perspectives (although I prefer historical precision), but it never gave me the chance to enjoy myself. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this harsh mess, while they were just a little more accurate. Very disappointing - avoid.
