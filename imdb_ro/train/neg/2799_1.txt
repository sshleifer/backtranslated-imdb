Who wrote the screenplay for this movie is not worth working at Hollywood (not even living there), and those actors have to find another job. The worst hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just looked to see if it would improve what, unfortunately, it did not do for me. Even in the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I think there were not many people behind the movie, so he had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly. This movie is definitely a great guide "How not to make a movie". Too bad I can not give 0.
