Everyone seems to have revenge on the subject and not to see how the movie was made. The deaf, the dumb guy is fine, the victory wins - that's good, the cricket look is great, but the movie is average in general. I think it could be done much better than it is. Plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event. I'm sure the movie could have become more interesting. The songs are just stuffed there, and I had to literally advance the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles. Watchable.
