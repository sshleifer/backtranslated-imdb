This unimaginable story of hope comes. I hope you will never have to endure something so horrible again. * cough * Razzie prize * cuse * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was unpleasant, predictable and unprecedented. While I was watching, I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low the film standards could be before complaining. When I asked for my money back at the end of the movie, I was informed that because I looked at everything "I did not have the right to reimbursement." I was told by the assistant manager that more people complained and already received reimbursements. The film's summary is quite simple. The liar thief steals a diamond and posits for a child to free himself from the police. Under this smart contour there is a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious sketches. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people hit by the pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see dwarves that look like babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial benches? Do you think babies say goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa? Excuse? If you answered "yes" to any of the above, then this movie is for you. Although it has been billed in some places like "The Worst Movie of the Decade," there may be a movie or two that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. We gave this movie two stars because we all know that a one-star review would indicate bias from the reviewer and then the review will not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and can not recommend it to anyone in good conscience.
