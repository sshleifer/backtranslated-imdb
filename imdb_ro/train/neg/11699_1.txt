Thinner plot is certainly thin. And rough. A obese lawyer can lead the gypsy woman, and the gypsy curse makes them lose and lose weight ... to the bone. Okay, the curse of the Gypsies should be fun, but the weight loss was bad? Not. Except Stephen King believes that. And Michael McDowell, another horror writer and scriptwriter of this great movie, does this too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is also fat, haha! Thinner is like an immoral piece of nonsense for a person who sighs as he has never seen something as disgusting as fat. Hey, I can only say: Look at the mirror.
