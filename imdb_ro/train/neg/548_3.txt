I saw 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on the basis of which I decided to watch this movie my roommate rented. She said she saw her before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw her," she said. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies that deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, this is not worth more than a 3. Any film which can always guess what will happen next is not it's good for me. Characters are unbelievable, the way the act is not realistic at all and their motives are invented. It is dramatic and the songs are not so great. The biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are far too exaggerated and, therefore, not realistic. Any emotion or connection between characters that is subtle should be magnified with a useless song. I think I understand that the relationship between father and son was more like one of your friends than one between parent and child, without having to have passed through a song five minutes long. Stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary (I understand, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If a movie tries to tear out the most broken means, it's not at all significant, it's a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> In general, if someone has terminal lung cancer stage their son, who lives with her knowing anything it was wrong, without having to say it. Too many plot holes. Initially, the film was funny and cute way Bollywood films are for people who do not follow so hungry, but just tired. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and unimaginable and the best way to do this usually does not have all the funny parts of the first half of the movie and all the parts of the heart at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** ***** SPOILER OVER may be a little deeper than other Bollywood movies that I saw, but not much at all. I spent more time laughing at the fool of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny. I did not shed a single tear, nor did I feel that way, I was rather overwhelmed by a sense of disgust for trying a dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, we recommend you watch a Bollywood movie that is sad.
