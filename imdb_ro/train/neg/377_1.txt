Do not even ask me why I looked at this! The only excuse I can do is I got sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie that is, not the Brons. The actress is full of death, Richard Grieco makes him a serial killer, happy with weapons, with a boring to beat the cops. Nick Mancuso broadcasts in a show as a policeman on his route, and Nancy Allen manages to put herself into a nice role in the whole movie. The script is grim, full of cluttered lines: "Are you ready, Pardner?" he carries Richard Grieco to each of his victims. Terrible. Avoid.
