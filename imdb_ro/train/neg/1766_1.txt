Baldwin really bent to make such movies. The script, the music, everything in this movie is a waste of time. FX sound does not sound real, it's too much (technical gadgets, etc.) If you're trying to make a movie about things like that, at least try to be real to it and drop those curses and beep- because those gadgets do not really make such sounds so great. Natural sounds, such as footsteps and so on, are nonexistent, which gives them a void-like atmosphere. Direction seems to be fine for such a low budget movie (I hope it is a low budget production), though it seems sometimes amateur. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem empty and fake, they just did not make this movie very well. I would have imagined that it would have been a better idea to make Baldwin say something Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English when we all know that their language is more vibrant and vivid and therefore the performance of the actors can suffer if a strange language is used. I mean, can someone realize how stupid it is to get international actors to speak English with bad accents? He should have a long corpse in film production. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film succeeds again in describing European police as lazy and corrupt, vulnerable and helpless. I mean if the plot goes again like "Interpol can not make a jack, so let's call an American to bring down this international union" or anything else. Sony Pictures heels the same way as Columbia before, producing only movies for the hell. I would imagine they have a self-respect. Buyers should buy any dirty title just because Sony puts something good a few times a year ?! Perhaps they should have used the same team as the ones who made Di Que Si - Say I Do. It's in Spanish, and Paz Vega and Santi Millan make a decent job keeping the movie afloat. It looks and sounds much better! Come Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
