Wow, a New York politics movie, apparently written by someone who never stood in New York. You know there's a problem when, at some point, you expect the credits to roll and the movie go on for half an hour. The characters are boring, John Cusack's accent is ridiculous, and the plotter line teeters between boring and ridiculous. A terrible movie.
