OK, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong scene productions, New York with the original cast and one from San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, rock!). Compared to any of these, the film is almost undiscovered. I was plodding through the DVD for the last two evenings and I have not finished yet. Dialogue too much alien, and too many scenarios and people added. Yes, the four major shows are pretty good, esp. Mrs. Streep. But comparing the scene with the film is certainly an example of "less is more". The thickening of the piece to meet the need to watch the film for a variety and stage specificity was a bad choice. Please, please, please find a production scene somewhere near you.
