We did not know whether to laugh or complain about this distortion of Canadian history, especially the service of the history of the Yukon Police. I leave Piero Berton, historically noted, born and raised in the city of Dawson Yukon, and author of the definitive history of Klondike Gold Shame, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this foolish film: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an unbounded frontier, subjected by six armed soldiers, continued in Country Far, another story about a western American cowboy - Wyoming this time - driving beef beef in the golden land. The image is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the true incongruity is the main hypothesis on which the plot returns? that there was only one policeman assembled in all the Canadian Yukon at the time of golden acuity, and that he could not deal with unrighteousness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the vagabond is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where is the cop?" Brennan asked. Bad. The problem with chilkats, "replies someone, has a very hard job, that master who patrols about ten or twenty thousand square kilometers, sometimes I do not get home for two or three months at a time. The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the golden daze was the closest thing to a British police state, North America has ever seen. The mounted northwest police have been located in the territory considerably long before the Klondike hit. each route in Yukon and did not give any nonsense. They collected customs duties, often over the charges of new arrivals, made arbitrary on-site river navigation laws and turned men back if they did not have enough goods or if they In the true Canadian way, they set moral laws for the community. "In Dawson, the Law of the Lord's Day was strictly respected: it was a punishable crime with a fine to cut the wood on Sundays, and the young old women were arrested for what the stern police are shouting about "giving risque performance in the theater," basically nothing but dancing suggestively on the stage in very stockings open. , a gun band was unthinkable. A notorious bad man from Tombstone, who was trying to pack a gun on his hip, was personally disarmed by a young master who just got him out of a salon for the wild crime to talk too loud. The evil man left like a lamb, but protested when the cop, after discovering that he was wearing a gun, told him to teach him. "No man has yet taken a runway from me," the American said. "Well, I take it," said the detector gently and did it without additional strength. So many revolvers have been confiscated in Dawson, that they were auctioned by the police for a dollar and bought as souvenirs to keep in the mantelpiece. In 1898, the great year of the stampede, was there not a serious crime? not to mention a murder? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, a lawless city led by Soapy Smith, the trusted man at Denver, was remarkable. But in the far land, Dawson is seen as a community without a law, which a character from Soapy Smith from Skagway? he is called Gannon in the picture ?? can easily control it. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border confiscated all his equipment and was frogmarched back even by a mounted police sergeant). In Lone Monetie, "Yes, I am the law, I represent the law on the Yukon Territory, about fifty thousand square kilometers of it." "Then why are not you anymore?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday was a wildlife, we did not expect you to spill the thousands. Now that you're here, we'll protect you." "When?" <br /> <br /> "It will be a post set here at Dawson in early May" <br /> <br /> "What's going on between now and May, you'll be here to keep order "<br /> <br />" Some of the time "<br /> <br />" What about the rest of the time? "" Choose a good man to act as a marshal ??? < The film Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture. Does his stunning suggestion that a US city marshal, complete with a metal star, is sworn by a group of people who live in British jurisprudence? Of course, they want to make Jimmy Stewart a marshal, but he clearly fits the role, but Stewart plays Loner as the number one, so another man is chosen to be shot. Others are shot Even Walter Brennan is shot Stewart finally arrives at the reluctant conclusion that he has to end all the shooting with a few mpuşcături his. He spins the star board and he bully, Gannon, bump into each other in climate inevitably sunset. For anyone with a passive knowledge of the Canadian north, this cheerful resumption of storytelling passes rational faith. <br /> <br /> Extract from Canada at Hollywood by Pierre Berton, 1975.
