A high school director (Keenan Wynn), with a lost basketball team, involuntarily employs a coach who turns out to be not only a lovely blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for the new winning ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way, a love story develops between coach and team player Jack (Michael Biehn). Police are never notified. Packaged along with other Crown International Pictures movies, as well as a movie, this film does no job. This can be easily edited in a television movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her expensive outfits, but I expect more than just a dentist in a R-rated movie. A side plot involving a dorky center that is hypnotized by his teammates to believe he is former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's new success rather than coaching Cathy Lee. Too much confusion and lack of weakness makes this a great disappointment.
