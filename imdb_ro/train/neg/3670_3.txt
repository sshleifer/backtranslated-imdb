For a science frenzy to be frightened to function well, it must be either original or a very good story. This movie is none. Of course there is a pseudo-original twist in that man kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease, but this is a very small twist. There is the angle of government conspiracy, the protagonist of the crusaders who have personal experience ... And the real disadvantage of this film is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the character is written as someone who should be merciful, it is not. No mercy, the movie is useless. The other characters are so cookie cutters are ridiculous. Subplots are complicated and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too flat to be liked as a machete material. Take the short movie for 45 minutes and it could be forgotten.
