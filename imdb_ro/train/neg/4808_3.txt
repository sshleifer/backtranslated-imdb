Okay, I've seen a lot of films dealing with the witch and the occult, but that was just weird. This film starts as this witch cult led by a really bad evil Orson Wells playing the role of looking (could not have gotten someone who looked and acted more like a Satanist), he did not belong in this movie at all. But, anyway, the covenca takes a new member and owns a doll that resembles someone and makes it a mistake. The lady who had the mistakes and her husband go to a place called Lillith on the bus and the lady sees a picture of her sister or anyone who calls her and warns her to stay away from her and never use her powers there or she will die. The couple, after settling in the weird city, discovered that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nose and fear of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things begin to happen as the lady discovers a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (which was creepy) as well as seeing Orson Wells's boy at the playgroud that she later asks the lady help him to bring them back to life. The lady soon tries to escape the city, but only to be trapped by its inhabitants and powers, and finds itself ignoring everything the spirit is trying to warn. This movie is ok, it has moments of suspense, but it really could have done a lot better than having Orson there.
