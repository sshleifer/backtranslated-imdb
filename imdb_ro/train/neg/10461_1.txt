Interestingly to read viewers' comments on the Omega Code ... many of the overwhelming positive comments have been raised almost word by word from the TBN ... the movie seems to have been made to go directly to the video, to be stored apart from the three part-rapture series that was made by another religious group in the 70's .. do not remember? You will not remember this in a year or two. This is the first movie I've ever seen where it was implicated that it was your religious duty to go to her and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... that means if you are a son of a TV channelist, and you can play a Hollywood role producer with tens of dollars ...
