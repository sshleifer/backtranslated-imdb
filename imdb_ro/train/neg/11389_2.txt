If you like movies that have been filled with a parcel little show with pungent sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the lead actress / actress (the new transsexual) has an interesting presence on the screen, but not it's enough to add much more than just an interesting movie - if that's what. In essence, this film is made up of three social ticks (transsexual prostitute, male and Russian prostitute, homosexual immigrant) who have somehow developed a link. Why is not clear. We are expected to accept that these shortcomings are the best honest basic people who have the ability to love while shaking their bodies on the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her sugar father for ninety years! The director shows a part of the unpleasant and unpleasant life, while he wants us to believe that these subjects are really normal, to the extent that they have a menage of trois that helps them through life. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a real aspect of life on the wild side. In conclusion, no plot, no truth, no real reason for spending much time here. Unless, of course, you like to enjoy!
