This film was a great disappointment in the direction, intellectually, the plot, and the way he dealt with his subject painting. It's a slow motion film, set as an episode of the Years of Wonders, with a terrible lack of depth. It also fails to convey its message in a convincing way. The approach to the subject of painting is very elite, limited to vague and subjective terms such as "beauty". According to the producers of this film, "beauty" can be experienced only in Bob-Ross style Kitsch landscape paintings. Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic color theory (such as primary school level) and many feelings. In some parts the film is offensive, eg. at a certain point, it is stated (rather, celebrated through table dances) that people with mental disabilities are unable to have emotions or to express them through painting, their works being, by definition, worthless "nonsense" ). /> I do not understand how such a rating could be obtained, and again, not many of them rated it and chose only for very high or very low grades.
