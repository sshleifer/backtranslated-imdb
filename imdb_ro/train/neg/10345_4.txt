Until 1941 Columbia was a major studio with full rights and could produce a film with the same technique as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing to say about "Adam Had Four Sons," a lead-made telenovela with almost no-exponential performance performance by Ingrid Bergman (top-billed for the first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchman (this was the era in which Hollywood considered a foreign accent was as good as another) hired as the governor of Baxter's four sons and staying on (with an interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907) until boys are mature people serving in World War I just about everyone in the movie is so good-Goody is a relief when Susan Hayward as cunning enters through ?? at halfway distance she is the only person in the movie to be easily watched, even though she is clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles? but the script remains saccharine, and the end is absolutely absurd. No wonder Bergman refused to represent the graph similarly, "The Valea Decision" four years later.
