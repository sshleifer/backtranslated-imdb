I just saw the premiere of this movie on MTV. I have to say that this was extremely mediocre (the best). Dialogue does not explain the story very well and I was left to feel that there are a lot of plot holes. There is no good character in this adaptation because of a bad action. I just discovered that all the characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem brother and sister rather than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept something like this under his roof. I watched this movie because of a few actors I respected and liked to watch in previous films, but, as I said, it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrible, which was a complete shock. It was terrible to be Edward's big sister, and there are not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me, even to criticize my performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great to see him recently and even if his character was a little tired, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they ought to have been our heroines, but they came like stammering and too dramatic. I did not really enjoy this movie or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that little look will not convince me to see this movie again. MTV did a great job to convince me it was a movie I did not have. I just shot something completely different.
