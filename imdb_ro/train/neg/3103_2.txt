So there's an old guard and a dying guy and then KEVIN, the biggest blow in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, tender and virginal AMY girlfriend. As he returns from work to ... a random house ... he finds his "friends," Kyle Kyle and KISS, and Daphne really outrageous. They are soon with Dick's boyfriend, NICK, who hit her hands with a trigger-happy angle. And they are the title creatures, a horrible, huge doll that kills people by giving them the heart's desire. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a frightening, madman in spandex. Nick's heart's desire is to throw grenades into a school canteen - I mean the nightclub. Kevin's heart's desire is to defeat a bully bully with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting whore. Daphne is already a disgusting whore, so he does not have the heart's desire. Throughout a really hideous band they sing a really weird song. Hobbobbins return randomly from where they came from. "Citizen Kane" can not hold a candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
