Finished this movie ... I saw him on the video shelf and being a fan Nick Stahl, I just had to rent him. With all sincerity, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was exciting and there were some pretty smart twists and turns, but somehow I guessed almost all before it came along. And the movie just went too far in the end in my opinion ... if you have to suffer through a visualization of it you will see what I mean! On a positive note Nick Nick's actor was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same character character ... too much Paul Finch from "American Pie" that comes because I liked it. And finally, the worst part of this movie must be January Jones's emotional performance ... I think a beautiful girl is all that matters in Hollywood.
