I did not expect too much on this TV movie. You have to set the bar below the language for any TBS movie with Antonio Sabato Jr. However, he managed to disappoint, not even a good movie. Every scene was roaming, as if someone had cut and stuck the scenes from a dozen movies and television shows dealing with big business conspiracies in the script, leaned back and said, "My work is made". Everything is cliche, all predictable and, worse, actors are forced to seem to take it seriously (even when plot developments are ridiculous). Do a favor. Watch "X Files" if you have a paranoia. They do better. Also, to know that sitting through "Fatal Error" is just that.
