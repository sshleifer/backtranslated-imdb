I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to look on a Saturday night, I think. But what really ignores me is when writing on the DVD box does not indicate this to the potential viewer. Discarding religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, brother. And even if I was a religious person, I should have liked to agree with most of the posters here, this movie was a mess. Directed badly, ill-fated, poorly written, and trying out a soundtrack was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and the continuity was out of the window. The only reason I stood in this waste of time was that it was too late to see another movie. You should have slept. Absolutely without redeeming qualities for this film, unless you are the religious guy who will immediately support anything that will preach to the faithful of the unbelievers, even if there is a bunch of garbage. If you are not, avoid this at any cost. Do not be fooled by writing in the box.
