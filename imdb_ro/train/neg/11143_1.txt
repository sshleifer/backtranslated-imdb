Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies and when I saw the title of Darkwolf which hit shelves, as I was like "hmm, simple and beautiful name, at least ... Althou ... I wonder why I did not heard before. "<br /> <br /> First, the movie starts with tits. A lot of tits. The breasts are pretty much all this budget movie went to. Who cares about a werewolf effect, you only pay enough to get actresses topless photos! So mysterious dark character (a bit of spoilers ahead, but who really cares ...) It is the usual average rider. Even super-tough, but as the old wise woman says in the film "it is more powerful and more dangerous than you've ever encountered." Just by describing a type of biker type tattoo of a guy. Pretty original. I even looked twice when first used "red eyes glowing" special effects! I want to say my god, that the effect "allow-plant-red-points-on-eye-with-calculator" effect has been used since the seventies. It just looks ugly here! And do not make me start with the 3D-CGI werewolf. As I said earlier, like a bad and old video game. And finally, as do the Werewolf movies, as I said. They always build a legend of their own werewolf. Darkwolf building and the world of wolves, about some silly legends about werewolves hybrids and the old blood line. BUT. Almost instantly, after creating the hiring rules "Darkwolf kills anyone who touches the little girl," she starts to twist at random. What makes no sense, why it really bothers to tell us the rules of killing when they will not even play them ... Aplus magnifying glasses are made with a Sony handycam or something, filming more the floor and the walls . It just adds mumble noise and you have a superwalk effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf pushes them all with an open hand, just by putting a hand on the top of the victims, it just does not trick for me ... Truly WHO gives money making these piles of horror unwanted, not funny - bad movies, just sad.
