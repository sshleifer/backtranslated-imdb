Please be warned: this movie, though a rather bad story, was one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... EVER. Remember that before you sit on your couch enjoy the movie. So officially start with a party. Just the usual party, but there's a guy out there. It's enough in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Save his face; will help later. So anyway, Kate goes to find George Clooney (I did not say that the plot is bad?) And so he takes the tube. This is underground in London in the middle of the night, but it's simple like that. So the timetable says the next and the last train will come in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, the wonderful little girl she is, decides she can have a 7-minute nap in the reserve. He usually misses the train and is stuck in the London Underground. Single. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie continues from there. Blood, courage, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I will not mention are cut and injured and eventually amputated from the body. In short, it is a typical horror; Pretty pretty, but in the case of women suffering from distress and psychopathic sick, odd. Or, as the case may be, Creep. I'd say go away if you're in the Saw, Hostel or Massacre in Texas Chainsaw, but for the rest of us, Scream satisfies the horror of great need.
