Sure I saw bad movies in my life, but it was so bad that I became angry in the theater. I wanted my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to return my movie ticket, of course I did not get any reimbursement (or even a reply), but it's important. On a scale of 1-10, I give this film -42. Why "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer?) Does not run out of being hit with a beating? Why did they hit the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat instead of breaking the skull of the hobo? The plot was thin, the film was full of obvious clich√©s, and some of it had no meaning.
