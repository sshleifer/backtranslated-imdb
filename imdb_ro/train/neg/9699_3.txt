Despite what many other people thought about the first film, I really liked it. However. How do I summarize a word ?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! But let's look at it in part: Here's the question: Finally, the old queen was removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has problems of another kind: The Jester Court, the father of his son, wandered as the gorgeous, Spliss, goes to the extreme, fights his gray hair and sells royal parents of blond and full hair. In despair, the white snow seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find the other dwarf comrades and then try to find royal descendants or at least try to find Rumpelstiltskin's name. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written in a weekend, where the writers were very drunk, but they were under the pressure of the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first party or fans of any other actor, it's not worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least saves the film out of complete oblivion is the performances of some actors. That's why I gave the 3/10 movement. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them can combine the bad story. For example, at one point, they even go into our reality and unfortunately .. do not do anything funny while it is here. However, a lot of great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many others much, but unfortunately, all of these comedians are not able to bring this scenario to life very bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a treat for some hardcore fans, but for regular filming or so far, tenants or DVD buyers are not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I really regret renting the movie.
