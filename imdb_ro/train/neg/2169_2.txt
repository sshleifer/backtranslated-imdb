I usually enjoy the early films of Loretta Young: acting at that moment was light and breezy and she certainly knew to wear clothes. But this is just a loser of the word, except for a funny backing game by Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatcheck girl who tells her husband-writer (Paul Lukas) to become a champion podium champion. It is not the most cinematic of the games, and the middle, talky, in the middle of which their marriage collapses, almost kills the movie. But there is an interesting aspect. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk begin their climatic play, a series of fast-moving photos show the planes, the trains, the football games, even a diver in the air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a frozen frame I've seen in an American movie. I want the rest to be inventive and funny.
