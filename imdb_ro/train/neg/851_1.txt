After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what was going to happen. We had big expectations for the film because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie two stars out of 10 is that it was good to try to be a movie. I have some main points because I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ********** <br /> 1. Casting. Jack Nicholson barely matches Jack Torrence's character. Also, I would NEVER have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I photographed Wendy a lot differently. I understand why they chose Jack Nicholson, his smile, his eyebrows, but he should not really look "bad". He should look normal and he gets sick. They also make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was fine, he needed more life. He acted to grumble. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut off so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book I was expecting in the movie were either deleted, changed, or misplaced. Some things that were in the book I was looking forward to seeing (the cover animals, the rock mache, the elevator) were not in the film and they were two and a half hours! I was very irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy was never injured ... The Overlook did not blow. The end was so cool in the book, and the movie made it so horrible, I was apalled. Hallorann did not have to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If he wanted to kill him, at least Jack would use a hammer. You have never seen a rocking hammer all the time. There are other things I did not like the movie, but there are things okay. The room's angels were cold, the blood coming out of the elevator (it did not happen in the book) was cold, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie did not go with the book to try to be scared at all. I recommend reading the book before seeing this movie. I applaud Stephen King for agreeing to sign a contract to stop giving Stanley Kubrik. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights that I could call all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least she has animal cover. <br /> <br /> Rate: 2/10
