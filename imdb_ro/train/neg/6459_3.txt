Such great actors such a disappointment. Marlon Brando has a terrible character, the movie is not at all funny, a subconscious message can be seen "It's a Crap," "Suucces So Excelent!", "You Pray Your TV", and soon. It's simply disgusting and disturbing. Besides the crazy plot, the sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me die, everything is so colorful it can cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about decorating in the movie, but this from Free Money made me upset. Avoid at any price! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a viewer gets nothing! One is following him at health costs.
