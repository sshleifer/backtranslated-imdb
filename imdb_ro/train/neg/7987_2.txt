I'm sure it was one of those "WOAH!" the attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just silly. The message of the film is the clich√©. Circle-Vision disoriented. And that terrible song from the end is retained. And I really would like to install chairs. After all this, all you want to do is sit down a few minutes. And when you hear there is a movie to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You have fun while sitting down, do not you? WRONG! Stay there for 18+ minutes, leaning against a short railing. Disney should make a new Maelstrom as an attraction to enrich things and to replace this tedious and uncoiling movie. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. Move on. In fact, skip Canada if you do not eat there. Go straight to the UK.
