Why?!! It was an insipid film, uninspired and embarrassing. The grating comes from being out of town where they did it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people do such a BAAAAAD movie there? When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and nothing ROBO. Everything has changed with Disney's fun. WHY???? They made a terrific interpretation of this classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broderick to have fun with his own movies was no fun. Sheesh !!
