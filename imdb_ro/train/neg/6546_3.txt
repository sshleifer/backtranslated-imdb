The old axiom that boring people are boring people is well demonstrated in "Women in Love". The script, taken from D. H. Lawrence's novel, contains an endless stream of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric. What stones did so much effort in such an empty exercise; what a lot of empty characters given such attention. Despite high production figures, this film is as tiring as its staff. A revision in 2001 only confirms a 1969 impression of the juvenille mind in adult bodies, dealing with nowhere and groping every step of the way.
