After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews that compared it to Lite In Translation LITE. When I read that I could immediately see the point of remembrance. This movie was a poor attempt on a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 Elements" alarm the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie, while "Lost In ..." better planned seems to stretch in a few long days. Make sure some people see this because they have Morgan Freeman and they will be disappointed. It seems that his better roles now-a-days support roles in big blockbuster, rather than main roles in sub- $ 10mil limited media releases and indie films.
