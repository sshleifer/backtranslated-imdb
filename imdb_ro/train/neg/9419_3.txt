I've never heard of it, then I found out he's the dead-lens man I've heard, but I have not seen. Connery's lead me to buy it and it's not good. He wants to be a sort of cross between Dr. Strangelove and Mash, but it's not that funny unless you find the name General Wombat (?) Funny. It happens like a flat thriller of 70 years until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. There are many, many flat scenes in Whitehouse between the president and his helpers who do not work. It's almost as if the original cut was too long, and the first half was edited to reach the whole story of the nuclear bomb redeeming and suicide bomber attacks that they think are meant to be played for laugh but again I'm so funny. Filming the location is great, but studio stuff looks like a cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did that. Just laughs: Connery threw his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. It's done Never say It never looks like a genius.
