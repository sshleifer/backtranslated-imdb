He has recently seen this movie and I have to say that it was the most serious attempt to make the movie I've ever had the misfortune to see. What the hell happened to Coolio? Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress. Total incapacitated, slow, tiring and detached. Worse than Spawn. long live "Evil Dead II".
