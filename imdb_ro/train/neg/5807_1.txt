You do not even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged by your own merits, but compared to the original 1972 version (which is a classic), it's terrible. And BTW, someone commented that the 1972 movie is bad compared to the book. This is silly, movies should never be judged against the books from which they are taken. These are two completely different art forms (as though this should be emphasized, but it seems to be happening). If you used this criterion for all the movies, then "2001" would suck and it would be "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs."
