The worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for an unexplained reason, have super powers and when they use a special device, they turn into strange, badly designed costumes. The actors, when not in the late costumes, are decent. It's certainly not good, but not the worst action I've ever seen. However, when they wear their costumes, actors act from evil to worse; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have a multitude of unnecessary movements they make. Even when they talk, they seem to have convulsions. The villains are more stupid than the Rangers. Every episode, a poor idiot, comes with a plan to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack Rangers. Rangers initiate their transformation animation for 10 hours, then alienate the aliens. Then the ill-conceived villain, who may be either an armored bastard who looks and acts badly in a humanoid creature like a ladybug, with trumps attached to the back, showing obvious signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers masters struggle with the villain, then the villain turns into Godzilla, whether it's a rain cloud or a nuclear rocket (yes, they burn warheads on creatures, and creatures turn into giants). Power Rangers spend 5 minutes as animated animators and call their Zords, which are obviously the toys the show producers used to make them look real. Power Rangers wins, the villain becomes mad, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake fights with kung fu.
