a friend of mine bought this (very cheap) and decided to give me a birthday present. I thought I would never forget because I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD seemed pathetic but then my friends and I was really bored and watched it. from the beginning till the end! I know quite well an achievement, but it is really a masterpiece. is hard to describe. you should see it, it's a real lesson about what people are capable of when they think they are creative and intelligent and they really are not. The "actor" is sous-terrain (you can actually see "lady leader" laughs on some occasions, she is certainly the worst). "the story" is to be bad to be summed up and really everything in this movie sucks. please pay special attention to the "Sheriff". the guy is an adult and therefore has no excuse to be involved in this. is extremely bad. no matter what he had some hilarious moments. check it out, haha
