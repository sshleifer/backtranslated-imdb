This movie was bad. Evil acts, directs badly, I write bad. But it was not bad in a fun way. It was badly boring. I looked at the "Surface in the Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I did. There are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half, such as watching dry paint or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
