I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought the movie "Scary Movie", though not a great movie, was very good and funny. The movie "Scary Movie 2", on the other hand, was boring, not funny, and sometimes simply stupid. The Exorcist / Amityville show was probably the best piece of the movie. James Woods was great. Now I admit that I am disadvantaged because I have not seen some of the films that this parody has done only in the first place, where I have seen them all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that ruined some of what could have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes pull on the long road. <br /> <br /> Also the same jokes continue to repeat again and again. For example, the bird talking. Okay, it was funny first and maybe the second time. But he continued to repeat himself to the point of being annoying. The routine of the wheelchair type and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it continued to repeat itself and became stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes have been repeated since the first movie. For example, the cremation we call Cindy (Anna Faris) was amusing in the movie "Scary Movie," because Cindy had given her sex to the boy for so long that he had basically blue balls of hell and It was fun when it was created. But this time was not the place and not funny. Bath and sexual humor in general were more fun and well-programmed for the first time. Tori Spelling was annoying and really did not take place in this movie. But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon) Wayans) which, in my opinion, was the funniest character in the first film. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film. Do not get me wrong, I like the Wayans and their humor. That's why the movie is so disappointing. . . have a much more comical ability than endless jokes.
