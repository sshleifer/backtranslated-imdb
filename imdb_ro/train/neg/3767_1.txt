Budget, the decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste time with this piece of junk. The effects are nonsense. The action is silly. The only thing that could have done this even tolerable was a little cheap T & A and it gets scattered in the first 20 minutes. The only way to remotely redeem this movie is very strange profanity. They were like finding the seven men on the planet who never cursed before. Hats off! If you want to see a guy in a bad outfit just go back and look at the old pics pictures. The only way to be a good movie for Bigfoot is to have a big budget and some actors who have not come from the Frogballs Community Theater.
