I read some positive reviews about this movie and I was really surprised at how dreadful it was. Positioned as a cross between the story of AIDS and a kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit", this movie can not always remember what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a homosexual couple who has an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon have no longer a sexual life. When Mark dies, Simon - who has become accustomed to closing his emotions after being rejected many years ago by his father - tries to wipe his memory and feel like a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and wraps his tricks, while Simon opens it and recognizes his true feelings. Unfortunately, Simon is an egoistic SOB, it is impossible to feel any empathy for him for most of the movie. Until it should be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows demoes of Demi Moore from "Ghost", crying deeply throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre change in tone after Mark's return. Suddenly we have some humorous attempts at "Bewitched". But that does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, everything becomes more and more mawkish, with amateur attempts to snap your hearts. The end, with a gold beating angel who accompanies a marker in the sky, while a Simon who has been subjected to pain, has been goodbye is just stupefying, especially because it is not intentionally funny.
