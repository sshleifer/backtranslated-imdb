The complaint concerns the death of children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the crimes. During the movie, he seems to have some troubles with his daughter. Eventually, the serial killer is caught. That's it. But before you find out who's surviving, you have to see terrible actors. It's unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like that, but for a great waste of my time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
