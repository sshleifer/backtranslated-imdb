This movie is so bad that it simply defies reality. Filming is at best school material, the act is pathetic and the director should be forever exiled from film production in any form. So bad it can not be seen as a comedy along the showgirls lines. The only thing this DVD was watching was art coverage. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those who have not had the misfortune of attending this is to do a well-deserved favor in advance and not waste your time or money on this trash. If you want to see a movie about comedy, there are many more worthy in such a field than this garbage.
