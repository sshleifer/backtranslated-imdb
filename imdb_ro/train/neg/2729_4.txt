Actress The philanthropic taste of actress Ruth Roman to help divert troops arriving and leaving in the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco began playing this Star All Star Warner Bros. to greet patriotism and song. Many celebrities are making appearances while a hate-love story develops between an infuriated starlet and a faint, green and weak Corporal of the Air Forces (Ron Hagerthy, who says he should broadcast newspapers on a bicycle). It seems the Corporal has misled the actress to believe she is out of the battle when she is part of an airplane carrier, flying to and from Honolulu (you think she will be happy to stay away from harm, but instead acts the same as most female females in the 1950s). Doris Day is about thirty minutes away, and her distinctive laughter and joyful song numbers are the most enjoyable. The novel is also full of charm, while James Cagney has fun at the character of his screen, and Gordon MacRae sings in his beautiful baritone. Jane Wyman also plays in a hospital hospital reply after leading Doris Day, challenging a question: "Did they get out of sets?" For unscrupulous viewers, an interesting retrospection for another moment and place. However, low rent production and appropriate technical aspects give Starlift a strictly second aspect. * 1/2 from ****
