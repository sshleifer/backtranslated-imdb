This movie is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about it: It was filmed in 1976 at the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, and at Canyon Oak Creek near Sedona, AZ. Much of the excerpts from the film are then students of the NAU drama. I was a first year student that year, minors in theater, but for some reason I did not get involved in production. However, I knew a few people who did and can provide this quite strange: There is a scene in this movie where two of the main, as part of their daze ritual, have to run naked in the woods. They are seen in the movie, doing that. The thing is, these are not the actors, but just the two guys I met from the theater department. The identity of these "post-stunt stunts" will remain anonymous, at least on this website, unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
