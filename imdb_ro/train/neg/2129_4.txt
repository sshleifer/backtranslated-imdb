In my opinion, this version of the great BDWY music has only two things for her - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a movie version of the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But for me that's all it is. Most of the song seems to go through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim is really, and no wonder people go to Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt, who seems to be returning a bar stool in Boston. Jason Alexander is acceptable, but the wig has to go and I've seen better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the scene scenario now, but I hope the young people out there, who have never seen a musical, CAN NOT judge everyone through it.
