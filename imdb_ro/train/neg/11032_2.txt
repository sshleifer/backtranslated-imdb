"I Love New York" is another entry of VH-1 (MTV Networks), which presents the fun part of a strident, unintelligible meeting. It must have been an easy decision to take the wildest, craziest, most crazy competitor - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, "This is a show." True, it's not as bad as the previous show, "Love Flavor" - but it's just as bad. She reminds me of a sketch of the show "In Living Color," where Keenan Ivory Wayans has boxed Mike Tyson at the "Love Connection" show and chose "Robin Givens" for a meeting. Mike talked about how the date was fine, but how the wrong mother continued to penetrate. This show reminds me of that. Men are elected and given names to degrade and the woman I meet more - (I think a smart man who wants to come to a smart woman CAN NOT - and her mother - give you a name which is so ghetto, you will be ashamed every time you appear on TV.) But these are actors of professional reality, so why bother me. I'm missing out on discovering what's so fun about all this. The fact that this is just as false as her recent implants? 15 Minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad network advertising? (Well, you can not hate it because you're trying to make a dollar.) Maybe it's great - who would want to be with this woman in an hour? Or you wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on WWF! Any way to cut it is a train wreck you've seen many times before, so until now the shock value is up to zero. No twisting or turning will make this a more interesting wreck, or any other than any other. The call to the lowest common denominator and to those who call an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin why it should end right away.
