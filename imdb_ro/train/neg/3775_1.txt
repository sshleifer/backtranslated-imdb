As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. Colors are bold comic books. I think the director has been removed with his "artistic vision" on the aspect of the film, instead a very necessary attention to content. Despite its stellar expression, performance is unclear, and the story is almost incoherent. Madonna was probably a casket just like a stunt to get the press. A good thing, because his appearance here gave a credible credit to his album, "I'm Breathless," which was a stratospheric blow (largely due to the inclusion of a "Vogue" is not in, and does not have the slightest link to this movie). I guess most of the money came from the links to Madonna's album "I'm Breathless". If you follow it at home, through final titles, you will think that "there are two hours of my life, I would like to go back." Save your lost time - do not bother with this.
