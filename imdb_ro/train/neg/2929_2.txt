Not funny - how can anyone connect with Monty Python? It is absolutely ridiculous - there is no laugh. This is not funny. On the top, but ugly, strange just for the weird sake, and it seems to me that these people have been on something all the time. Unfortunately, something that did not make them funny. There should be some points for effort, etc. In fact, there seems to be a laughing track - or is there one? Hmmmm .... Since there is no laughter, it's a questionable question. Maybe I'm doing an injustice - maybe it's some kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in this case everything goes, it does not matter. But these boys playing with women with high voices rise up in the nose. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one apparent heir to Monty Pythons' intellectual spirit and this is Stephen Colbert and perhaps Jon Stewart.
