Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, in a word, is outdated. <br /> <br /> In a plot comes as a mysterious vigilant woman (Batwoman) to get involved on Batman's lawn and while Batman tries to fight against a Trojan Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, try to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong wrongly about this, but there is nothing really special about it, really noticing that it has gone out. <br /> <br /> Phantasm's mask had Bruce's long lost love that took place with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a major event in Mr. Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> Even the movie Batman Beyond the Movie, Joker Spirits, deeply digged with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But the Batwoman mystery had some minor subplots, a lot of formula overtaken by a mediocre piece on a cruise ship. Honestly, this is more Scooby Doo than the Dark Knight, lacking the fist and bite the Animated Series has had in the foreground.
