Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the most likely brain strokes we have seen recently, and both suffer from the exact same problem to an aggressive extent. Dialogue is false false false. Nothing that comes out of the mouth of anyone seems to be believable from a distance. Perhaps the way this movie is created is how it should feel, but it has been undiscovered. And boring. I left after 20 minutes. I'll stay with the bedroom and bananas to repair Woody Allen. If I ever met this thing on the teevee, I'll go back and try to find an episode from Quincy instead.
