The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" was filmed again and released at home in the US through the film Faith. The original story refers to a priest who oversaw the body of a witch who only has the faith to protect him. Extensive and established in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (homes, clothing and furniture are all wrong, despite the English signs), this is a strange movie that does not really work. Its part is the weird setting that is trying very hard America is hard to frighten, but it is clearly not. There are also some strange, deliberately oblique moments that the main character is a reporter at first and a little later a priest. I'm not sure why they did, even after watching the play on DVD). The other problem is doubling that is beyond horrible. It is done at such a distance that everyone talks when their lips are not on the camera - or if they are the voices do not even fit the lip flaps off. I do not know if the fault of Faith Films or that of the producers who made the film hoping to cast in the West (revealed in the performance of the play). The movie is not very good. As I said it has all sorts of technical problems that make only a weird thing. Despite horror images that look good, the movie never works as a horror movie. As a film to create faith, it is too confusing in this narrative to make anyone feel closer to God. Given the choice, I would give it a pass, even at a bargain price. My advice would be to find the version of the 1960s about the story called Viy, which will bring both tremors and an understanding of a faith in God.
