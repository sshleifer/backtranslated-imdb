I do not know what you're in, but please stop. This movie was a complete garbage. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was full of love, cute, sweet, loving and extremely fun to watch. He had that innocence, but at the same time he was strong. This new baby, Alex? Annoying like hell! Only a flagrant ripoff attempting to match Culkin's charm and grace, not miserable at this. The villains, nonsense. Harry and Marv were such a fun team on the screen. They were comic, they were humorous, and they just made you want to get revenge for Culkin, which is supposed to be a good villain. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely perfect for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who are puzzled and again, try to capitalize on the charm and charm of the duo's first offenders. I'm not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even fun. More on the cornea side actually. <br /> <br /> Then I got the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classical. Memorable. Perfect to look around Christmas and bring a wonderful Christmas feeling and highlights so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story and care for the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? The masterpiece of nonsense. Quite telling. <br /> <br /> All and all, I do not know why people like it. I think people really do not know what the best movie is. She is a short eruption with more unrealistic pitfalls and a new stupid child, who want the robbers to beat their stomach at least. Run, run away from this garbage. And do not even let go with Part 4!
