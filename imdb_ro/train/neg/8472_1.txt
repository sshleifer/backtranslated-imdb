The film opens in front of Julian Sands, stretching out on the back, a black kitten that lowers blood in the expected mouth from where it holds, about two feet above him. It was so challenging and I thought, "Here we are, a good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then he died. This was literally the only scene that captured any part of the imagination. It was slowly, smoothly, afterwards. I was very disappointed, because my previous experience with Sands' acting was pretty good. However, this attempt was obviously misguided, and the script left much to be desired. Even the questionable performance of Julian Sands could not begin to save the already sunk dam of a movie. <br /> <br /> It's a 1.1 / 10 rate from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
