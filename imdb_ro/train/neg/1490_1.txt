First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she is just awful. This movie has every horror movement in imaginary clich√©, and all played badly. Teenager over sex. The comic jock (not excited). The chick is great. The type of local creepy color. Parental type couple. The virginal chicken, which, amazingly, never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painful and will be delivered with the depth of a swimming pool. It's almost like you want everyone to die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this movie some time ago, but in a way this has got worse. Sure, the funniest thing here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but hardly even evaluates a dog's rent. Avoid at all costs.
