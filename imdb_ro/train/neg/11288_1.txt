Lately, I have been subjected both to the film and to King Arthur on DVDs chosen by others for evening entertainment, and together they do nothing but bring out a growing notion that the contemporary film watching the audience in their entirety is non-discriminatory and is pleased with as long as they receive "action." Both films were garbage. What happened to character development? What happened to a meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And when we look at something vaguely claiming to be "historical," no matter what tried to capture a certain degree of precision, a realistic idea about the "political map" of time, even a little aroma of the age, attitudes. Why should everyone display the set value of America in the 21st century? I read on the discussion boards that nothing was known about the dark age. Not like this. There are considerable sums of money, with a much scholarly scholarship about the age, but these jokers simply can not be bothered to do any topic. I just want to vote 0/10
