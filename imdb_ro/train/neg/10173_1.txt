No wonder most of the cast wanted to never make this movie. It's simply ridiculous and embarrassing to look. Wicked actors who read the lines of cheese while classic showroom cars continuously shine a restaurant that looks more like an attraction in Disneyland. Pupils struggle with the disturbed director as they try to stop them from putting a fire in a statue of bronze civil war. Watts riots with a cast of ... ugh ... 10 ?? Dermot Mulroney tries not to fight while doing with Mary Hartman, with the most annoying smile since "Mr. Sardonicus." Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan's poems to the evil teacher with a moving pointer and a very facial lifting. drunk Rick Schroder is sitting in a rocket of children the last night before going to work. The stupid, lame schools dress up in leopard pants and walk around on the "Shindig" set, play horribly on the key and actually do it and whoever wrote that convincing dialogue: "I go to Burkley and I wear flowers in my hair" ... "I think I found someone to buy Stick Wood!" ... "These people are "animals"! "" These people are "my family," as Shirelles plays "Mama Said". My brother, What a mess, it's like a "Reefer crazy" in the 1960s, except it's not even funny.
