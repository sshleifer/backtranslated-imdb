I thought the Zombie 2 horror film was a good horror film When the body of the terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, was recovered by the US Army, the body was then incinerated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon, infected locals turn into scary meat flies and a group of soldiers on vacation have to work with a group of tourists and embark on an abandoned hotel as they try to fight the aggressively dead dead. I did not find this movie to be as good as the original Eaters movie zombie. But it was still a horror movie OK, with good action. I do not think he was one of the best in the series. 4/10
