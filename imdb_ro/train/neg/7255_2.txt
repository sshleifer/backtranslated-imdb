I was not impressed with this movie that has a moodless music and takes only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was asleep. I use excellent weather photography to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadows, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all it is. My preference is for his predecessor, the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 to 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel might be better than the original one, Powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes. Try them both.
