I have seen this recently on an old, discolored VHS tape, and I remembered it a little. Looking now, it looks charming. When it was released for the first time, it was almost all recognized as a doll to go out as a gay adolescent. To knock the point home, Mom is seen reading a printed copy of "1 teenager in 10", the most popular card of time out. David Warner hamsters as a hunter of vicious persecutors, which is, of course, a case of self-closet. The list of viewing gags and jokes that were included to make sure no one missed the point would be too long to enter. The producers had a pleasant fun, hoping to undoubtedly ease and lighten. But I have no idea how a teen audience will look at this movie nowadays. In some places where education and culture exist, the terrifying attempts that gay adolescents had to go through are things of the past. But I'm sure there are a lot of dark and ugly corners of our continent, where it's as bad as ever.
