Like most reviews, I have seen this movie under the name The Witching, which is the title of re-editing. It seems that Necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. Most witch scenes still feature most of the necromancer scenes and they are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity of the wizards has brought at least some entertainment value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 nudity scenes and there are people around the variety. There is no diabolical firefighter involved! This movie is so terrible that it's difficult to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is terrible and directly from the Troma closet. At least Troma is the tongue in the cheek. It is personified with boredom. Actress is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora child possessed in The Innocents You Believe!) The worst with her sparkling voice. Welles just seems to wait for his salary check. The other feminine lead has a terrifying face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her! And the doctor is too bad. He also looks worried about Gene Wilder. It is uselessly filmed with scenes that change for no reason and editing is confusing. This is because the witch is a copy and paste work, and not a subtle thing about it. Only lighting is OK. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with the new soundtrack that never stops. Mama "ghost" is also a garbage pit, but the actress is so hilarious in acting that at least offers some unintentional laughter. Indeed, this film (at least witchcraft) is just for the wrong one. He can not have many healthy fans, because he is quite infinite and I actually realized he was a boring mind! <br /> <br /> The best pic was when the credits rolled - pretty much said so much better for this bad excuse for a movie like PLAGUE!
