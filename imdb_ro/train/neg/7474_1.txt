This program did not do me, though I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there is not one scene that is not dominated by the main character. This made a little two-dimensional and I quit before the end of the program. I was hoping to criticize there that I'm not a critic of the film, however, the IMDb guidelines say you have to put in 10 rows of comments. He reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every scene and I hope the writers of this program could engage in greater diversity to engage with the audience. I do not doubt the talent of any distributor and crew, except that after seeing things like "the thread," I have come to expect great things from the police drama.
