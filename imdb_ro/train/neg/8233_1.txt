This was probably the worst movie ever, seriously. I may feel better, I have not even been set up correctly. It's like this movie would have a $ 5 budget and it's still changing. You do not look at him. I did not even get through this movie, I had to stop him. I gave it 1/10, because it was hilarious as the producer of this movie wanted to be a horror film, but it actually turned into a very bad comedy. In fact, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a lighthouse, and the car owner walked behind them. The leg I saw was a woman with a gun telling a lot of girls to get their clothes off, what the fuck? it has to be some kind of porny cheesy movies as well.
