I will not approach or criticize RAW theories. I mean, this is a site about movies and about the fact that the movie is or is well done, not a site that discusses philosophy. Having said that, this movie really blows. There's only one head shot of RAW after another. Some of them are archive videos, so you can see how it aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. But, otherwise, the viewing experience is unusually monotonous. It's a strange comparison, but I thought about the afternoon of Sunday when I looked at a starship Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * film). After a while, I was so daring at Barbra, I wanted to be a scene she would not have appeared: "Meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else ..." moment. But it was Barbra. Well, this video is RAW's * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So if your idea of ​​spending a good time is to look at the multiple angles and angles of the RAW face while he does with his theories, assembled in a blade structure that does not adds no interest or understanding, then be my guest. For me, I could not take it after 20 minutes.
