I once thought the "Stone Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "The Hobboblin" surpassed him in all the ways I could imagine, and a few that I could not do. In the "Stone Age" I hated his characters. In "Hobgoblins," I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity. I will not include a teaser on this movie, I'm not so cruel. I could not subdue innocent people, such as yourself, to such torments. In fact, any discussion about the plot belonging to this film is meaningless and meaningless. The words I would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine and ingenuous. In conclusion, please do not watch this movie. Please, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, please. For the sake of your own healthy and intelligent you do not see it. Destroy the copies you meet.
