Terrible pursuit of horror at "The Howling". This takes part in the funeral of Karen White (he was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee sad) gets there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He goes to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning's tip) headwriting. Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. A terrible scenario, a bad direction, an inappropriate editing, and terrible action by Brown and McEnroe sink it alone. The effects of the werewolf are kept longer in the dark - for good reason! They're terrible when you see them. Also, the special effects listed - though I did it as the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy, which is particularly bad and Danning pulls out at least OAM TIMES during the closing credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I found the village of Transylvania funny - it seems to have come from a horror film Universal in the 1930s! There are interesting room tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies, and Lee and Danning are good in this - but I can not save it. Really - why did they do that? Where are they hard for money ??? This is one of the smallest films of IMDb. That's the only thing that should tell you something. Probably Danning was terrified when he saw the movie - I understand why! A must-miss.
