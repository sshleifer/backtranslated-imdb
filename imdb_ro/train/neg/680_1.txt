Finally, I got to Starlight last night on TV and all I can say is. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - incredible hockey effects (check the laser beams from Willie's eyes!), Atrocious action, weighted dialogue, inappropriate use of stock images or the serious claiming air that infuses all production. This is truly a unique experience and we should all be grateful for that. I nominate Jonathon Kay as Ed Wood's true heir!
