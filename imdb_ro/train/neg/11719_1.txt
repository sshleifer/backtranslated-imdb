In the words of Charles Dance's character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development, and absolutely unbelievable. Complete things that are not happening in the real world (since British police inspectors were armed with guns in their shoulder holsters?). Together with the mistakes (the Bulgarian trains in London?). Completely boring and artificial dialogue. And targeting / editing is terrible - hand-shots that add nothing to the movie, except for a vague feeling of nature; disturbing; no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is totally unattractive - why should we care about what happens to him? Direct to the video? Direct to the trash!
