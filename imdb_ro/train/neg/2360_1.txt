This will be the most useless comment I've ever made, but I still have to make him warn you about the cinematic atrocity of Freddy's Dead. It's not just the worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but it's up there with the worst continuation of horror all the time! It was boring, useless, and almost no death. Terror 3-D that ends and those from CORNY above are enough to drive this "film" into the ground. However, it does not stop here, just add bad behavior, a terrible scenario, and a series of brick cups, and you've done it with this pile of guano! No wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, made two postmortem appearances. And if I did that. This is a strict movie for fans, do not look at our shame.
