A less than subtle blow to the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church has a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor plays an environment that asks more rhetorical questions, especially "If God is so good, why does evil exist in the world?" Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some may disagree) of the stereotypes of religious professors who take off the "company line" and condemn half the world to burn to Hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the school, she invites her first students to return and run her Christmas Contest. However, when the quartet "updates" their play for the parody of the "fallacious" teachings of Sister Mary, they pushed the edge, sending the story into a chain of unfortunate events. Finally, leave the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts. It is not recommended. Go to the clock instead of the game.
