Little Man, now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It's the story of a younger killer than a liar played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's bag after a rape. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, prepare the genius plan to disguise Marlon as a child and plant it at the lady's house. Then he goes through all sorts of "Home alone" or "Children's play" as if he could make the jewelry back and be treated like a child. I was surprised how low the humor was in this movie. The jokes have been made in other places so many times they are not cute or funny. Almost the film would have been more fun if she had not used CGI and used the little actor Marlon had glued her face to. In view of the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in the same way as Mini-me, but they chose another route. A few cameos and Tracy Morgan are making funny scenes. Put your rental fee on Borat if you want some real laugh these days. Http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
