I was really looking forward to this show, given the quality of the actors and the fact that the Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were shattered! However, again, we are convinced that the KGB is a group of crazy stinkers who have no idea what they are doing. At one point, there is a ridiculous scene in which 4 KGB agents could not handle a CIA agent. I'm getting tired of these biased, unilateral and completely inaccurate portrayal of the Spy game that went on during the cold war. I find it ridiculous that the United States is not capable of filming goals about their involvement in the Second World War and the Second World War. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma, again completely fake. To agree, "The Company" is very well filmed and actionable. Locations are also exceptionally built. Alfred Molina brings a tremendous performance like Keaton (The conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to enjoy this show and no doubt I will be watching the other 2 episodes, but I really want American productions to stop trying to imagine Spies, soldiers, etc. as supermen who are more intelligent and physically superior to any other planet. It ages fast and deviates seriously from the plausibility of what could be a 10/10. <br /> <br />
