Probably the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes. The only ones who laughed at the theater were the tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I like silly and silly movies as much as the next gala, but the whole premise, writing and humor was killed. It seemed to me that I was going to a feeling of "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, he came to be forced, strange and strange. The only bright light was Isla Fisher, and I felt great that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thank you for not paying for this.
