I tried how long I could stand by this irritating mess, but I could not do it. Brad Dourif suffered absolutely, while lead and all the support distribution were only less favorable. <br /> <br /> Everything is just absurd, from horrible action to ridiculous FX to stupid intrigue. <br /> <br /> The complete loss of time; do not bother. Treatment of the root canal would be more pleasant. Bamboo slivers under the nails would be much more enjoyable. Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be a little worse than that. Get the idea?
