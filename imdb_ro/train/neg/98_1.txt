I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie will be bad. After I did not follow him for more than a year, I finally saw her. a pathetic film. I almost did not finish watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair to write a review without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say that 'this movie is shit' I'm really shocked that a bad bee movie has even been funded to make this film pathetic but it could not have cost more more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. all you need is a cheap camcorder or a cell phone, about 15 people who do not have acting skills, a script written by a couple of drunk people. In the first part of this ultra-bad movement a reporter (Tara Woodley) leads an alleged beaten man about to report on a hunted city. He is completely unharmed. They went to an abandoned house, but, fortunately, almost completely furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there. just because you should be drunk, but it's not what it looks like. Then the alleged drunken man began to say Tara ghosts / stories zombies. blades stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Ben Draper has let one of his soldiers die of total exhaustion (I think this happens) after letting private poor soldier Wilson sit down, he allowed him to dig a tomb and then the soldier collapsed, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> kills him in a shallow tomb. But Sgt. Ben Draper are in the biggest surprise. the devil's wife / daughter knows about it and she and her boyfriend kill Sgt. Ben Draper to take revenge on private Wilson (near the tomb of the soldier he shot) The soldier wakes up from the tomb in the form of a zombie and kills them for revenging on his behalf. /> The end of the twist was so blade. Even if you love B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
