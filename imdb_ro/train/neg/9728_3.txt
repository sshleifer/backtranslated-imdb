Tobe Hooper made great movies, so I was sure he could not be BAD. I have not read any comments and tried to see this unintentionally humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost CRY for Hooper. I've rated this 3/10, because there has been a "horror" since 1990 and many interesting or fun things. Throughout the movie I thought something like "I just CAN NOT add more things to this movie ..." but they did. Some say this is a kind of Firestarter clone, but it really is not. It's based on that idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / things of God, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible action, incredible scenario ... and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * Story: The government is trying to create the last weapon that uses nuclear power or something and fails, during the process the baby is born for 2 test persons. When her mother plays her baby after birth, her husband and wife burn and is a spontaneous combustion. The government handles everything and lets this child live among other people, and ... after x years this child is grown up and realizes that he was born for a reason and that he can burn things with his brain. Then everything goes incredibly dirty nothing explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes "well now he can set this fire thing to work" led him to the normal hospital if there are some toxic nuclear weapons that will use this man because he could kill him, I can not shoot him no! .. and argh, I think it's enough to say, I promise there are 100 stranger things in this movie. Well, if you want a good laugh, watch him. Lord.
