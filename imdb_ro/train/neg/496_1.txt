Imagine you're a high school boy, behind a dark and careless theater with your girlfriend. How bad is a movie, because you feel obliged to leave the theater and go home before it's over? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies are often so bad they are good; this film is beyond that stage of evil. It's painfully bad. Horribal, terrible, evil against evil humanity.
