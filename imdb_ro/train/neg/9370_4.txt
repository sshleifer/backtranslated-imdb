Although not a "great movie", it is something convincing and memorable. As another commentator of the movie, I saw this in childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have never forgotten her ridiculously ridiculous story or title. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a small town voyeur of life as it evolves for decades. More than any other film, it brings a human face into the historical drama of "progress" the beginning of the twentieth century. It's delightful enough for a young spectator and memorable enough for an older one. Additionally, it's easy to like your characters and keep track of their time.
