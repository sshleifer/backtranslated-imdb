If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it's got to be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's young style director puts a shame in an already uninteresting and a little untried story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to look at. Some aspects of the plot were ridiculous and absolutely unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes have been closely related to weak plotting and terrible actors. But Keira Knightley gets completely naked. This is the only advantage of this movie. If you want to see her naked before the movie, up to about an hour and a half in her and you'll catch a lot of nipple. I suggest that no one ever see this EVER! </ 3
