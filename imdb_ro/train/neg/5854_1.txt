I just saw this movie on Flix after I recorded it. I grew up watching the movie F Troop and I had a major problem for Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked to find out after seeing this film that the degenerate human nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks pretty good but shows, also completely different and poorly photographed. I would never have guessed she was in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a photo like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie has nothing to push. No sex, no gore, no beating. It is also a remake of the atomic brain alias Monstrosity (1964 or there). Most of the action is tiring; the main character spends an enormous amount of time around the house and basement of the mad doctor and the neighborhood in general or swallowed by the cop, all boring and filling the time. Now, if the Italians did this, half of the film would have been an ice man from Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam who was drinking unconscious nude girls. But you only have this for 20 seconds.
