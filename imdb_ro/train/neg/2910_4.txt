The highlight of this film for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he was definitely thrown against the guy and showed he can cope with a nonradiating role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you love, admire and roots for. Sullivan was certainly not a good guy. It is true that, in the context of this film, he discovered a certain nobility - his purpose being to avenge the crimes of his wife and younger son. Even so, he was already a gangster and a killer before these crimes. So Hanks played a role that I would not have expected him to take, and he fired it well. On the other hand, I certainly could not say this movie was a nice movie. After an opening that I describe best as being enigmatic (it was not clear to me for a while), it turns into a very grim film about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mob boss, trying to raise his own two sons and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the bigger son witnessed a murder, the band tried to kill him to keep him quiet, he received the wrong son (and mother) and left Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.). She becomes a strange dad / son who binds a movie. Although it ends with somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story), it is indeed very dark, many scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rains. I have to confess that although I appreciated Hanks' performance, the film as a whole has not really fired me. 4/10
