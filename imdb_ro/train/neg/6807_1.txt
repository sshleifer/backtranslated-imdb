Spoilers? Maybe some details, but there was nothing about the plot. Not as if it counts on this movie. <br /> <br /> Rage Air is unleashed from the premise of the average infiltration of executive decision. Ice-T is leading a team of four elite orders wearing black black shirts that we can only imagine must hide the invisible body armor because their idiotic tactics (similar to those used by third-grade pupils when staring at Star Wars on the playground) a hail of fire. <br /> <br /> What amused me most about this movie was the use of actors that were aside. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once played in a movie that you really liked, although it was a long time ago that you probably will not be able to place it (it was Porky's ). Here Cyril plays a decent gap of character Bill Paxton. The most amiable are Gil Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as Buck Rogers. Instead of evacuating his past with heroic gentleness, Gerard gives us an acceptable performance of the hard fat crude person who was clearly imagined for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a hybrid-like hybrid performance like a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas guy. In the 10 years since New Jack City, Ice-T's act has deteriorated remarkably. It does not act as much as the regurgitation of the lines that they would actually have memorized. One of the elements being played in this movie is a classified information CD-ROM. It is worn by hand and apparently and unbelievable is not encrypted, despite the safety of the Gerard NSA character. What a joke. I very much doubt that the information that is supposed to be on the CD will all be assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I am in a closed aircraft without a silencer, the fire is about as loud as the preserved air and causes a person to wander, so apparently no foley budget . The choice of weapons is quite funny. The user of a coffee flight is about the most realistic representation of film violence. When he intuitively takes the mini-Uzi gun, which must be one of the worst gun models ever, it's too bad. A real elite team would wear MP-5 for this kind of work or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even personalized Hi- Powers if it was really old school, or something FN 5.7 if the new school ... The standard lame issue The 92Fs are absolutely incredible after they have lost most of their coolness after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys, supposedly experienced soldiers, have a mixture of absurdity like the above-mentioned mini-Uzi gun and a Tec -9 with the non-infamous infamy that is not a noise silencer. <br /> <br /> There was just one touch of realism that I would like to correct the other commentators: The Ice Flight Companion and Ice-T have lowered the craft to 10,000 meters for "breathable air" before opening the door. And I also have the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to close the door, that in principle has just given up this point. As far as landing is concerned, no flap was mentioned until about 2 seconds before touching. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only Dukes of Hazard rooting on Roscoe P. Coltrane to "crossing" could shame this movie to use the stock image. They obviously chose an incredible SR-71 (and retired) because they could not get an F-117. In addition to being defeated in 2001, let's forget and for a moment that the SR-71 is not a clean pure aircraft in the sense of B-2 and that the empty point ... Well, I am not an expert, but I doubt if it's invisible on Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, references to "F-15" when the F-16s were displayed were ridiculous. The details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put these few passengers on a 747 from the start, not to mention all that was idiotic about them. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical cables. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch Star or something. You do not pay to rent it, but look at you laughing. In the controversy for the worst film ever, right there with No Holds Barred, which had at least one originality.
