This movie may have poor production values, but that's what makes it so good. The special effects are rough and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy performed by Janelle Brady. It's super hot and has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as leader of the gang is hilarious, just like the other members. This movie is actually trying to make a point, saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 4/10 Hard comedy, gross movie.
