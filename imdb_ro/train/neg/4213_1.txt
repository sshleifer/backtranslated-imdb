Wow, I'm a great fan of the Henry VIII / Tudor era and, well, it was ... exciting. The only one I looked at was Ecaterina of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I have seen a bad action before, but this has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm ... crying? she was shouting and shouting, and I must admit that I have run many times ... many, many times ... fun, funny things. The only person who has shown any talent of talent was the actress who plays Anne Boleyn (maybe she is bias, I have a little obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a real woman, read it, it's worth it! ) I also read a lot about Tudor time and I think the characters were not very accurate, they were very stereotypical. Watch this movie only if you are ready to see a very important time, and the important lives of those involved have turned into a laughing fund.
