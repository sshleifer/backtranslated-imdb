slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the film of the book. This is certainly a case in which the film should never have done to the detriment of the book. The best part of the film was the scenery, excellent. The worst part was the slow interaction of actors, combined with endless looks. Editing is steep and uneven. However, despite this, the actors worked hard, at least trying to be a little credible with a terrible scenario. It was surprising that, although it was established in Peru, there was no one with a peruvian descent wandering around the set - even in retrospective scenes describing Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
