This must be one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. My DVD was given to me free of charge with an order I placed online for non-DVD articles. <br /> <br /> No wonder they have been given, certainly nobody has been able to give money for this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> As some commentators can say they have found a conviction of honeybee beggars, the person who includes it in the worst fifteen movies has everything on the scene. How on Earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman might be involved in this garbage is unbelievable. Generally, toilet humor and evil done to that. Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
