with all the European studios involved, you would think you will get at least a good enough photo; but the local color is kept to a minimum. Her # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. Is there a supposedly romantic story that is confused intentionally - is she a lesbian or not? - they do not serve any purpose. The cops in the movie are the fools who have long enjoyed a serial killer movie. There seems to be a message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s. But since almost everyone involved in this thing died, there is nothing in it. Despite the bullfighting foundation of a part of the narrative (which party - who can say), you never look at a bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
