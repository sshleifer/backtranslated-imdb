I have to say that I am really surprised by the high rating for this film. I found her absolutely stupid. Does mom get "visions" when touching certain things or people? And one thing he touched twice made the vision to continue ... It seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful, I thought. It was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did the bulk of the support pieces for what they had to work with. I usually love LMN and I'm very open minded when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and a top action and it just was not for me.
