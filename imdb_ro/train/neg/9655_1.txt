I've come to watch this movie before going through any review at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me know if there are people who recommend others to watch this movie. I am very shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site, which makes me conclude that it is a scam. As for my opinion, I have to ask, "Are these directors are retarded or do they assume that viewers are retarded?" The film is atrocious on so many levels and does not even talk about story or presentation. So these guys and a girl (the lead actress) form a music band; guessing because of the constant presence of the guitars, is supposed to be a ROCK tape. Hell, when the dancers started to become part of a Rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as a Bollywood rock-band version, but quite funny for all the scores that these two guitar players were doing all sorts of "ROCK GESTURES" and I guess they played instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely lacking !!! I just can not understand the magnitude of stupidity here ... I'll end here because it's worth noting any defects in the movie. Bollywood directors no longer have any shame !!!!!!!!
