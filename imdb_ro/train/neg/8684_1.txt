Abisal with a capital "A". This must be one of, if not the most unfortunate show on TV right now. They are just as anti-bush, but this show does not even get me out of the noise. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with or you will not enjoy this piece of shit spectacle. "The jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil Bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to al-qa-eeda!" Nothing is funny about that. Should it really be a joke? The commercials that were presented in the weeks following the show were more fun than the show itself, and that's just sad. We hope that this is not even considered for a second season. It should not even have been the first.
