Oh God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not look at this movie! In 82 minutes of my life I will never come back. Sure, I could not have seen halfway. But I thought it might improve. She did not. Anyone who enjoyed this movie is a seriously ill and twisted one. No wonder Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from acting to editing. I do not even write comments here, but in this case I will make an exception. I just want someone to warn me before I hire this catastrophe
