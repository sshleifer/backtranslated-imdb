I've seen teenage teenage movies in my time, but that's the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" in cheese-fest. The quality of the stars in this movie is not bad. Just the way it was done just send rolling down. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a soccer player of the American high school of the 1950s who does not get old because of the werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin. He led everyone batty! Ed McMahon plays the role of his ultra-conservative father, who has met the end of his own bullet. Alan's father, Alan, plays a psychiatrist who does not seem to be at the top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be very out of place because of the attack, and then he will have the chance to catch his own. More laughs than shed blood, this movie is just a beginning in the 80s, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement over this! 1 out of 5 stars.
