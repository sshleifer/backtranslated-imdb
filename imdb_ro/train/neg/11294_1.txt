OK, I've been a big fan of Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this movie. Let's name the problems ... First, this film has a large part of the same crew that the first two had. He was also called PREQUEL at the original black stallion. Why can not I get the name of Shetian Dam or her color correctly? In "The Black Armadillo Returns," we find that Sagr was BLACKEST's mother, and in this movie she's a big name for Jenny. WTF? And it was settled in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I could be wrong, but the first one was set in the 1940s when the ship wrecked. The time line does not sound good for me. Also at the beginning of the movie there is a frizian who should be Shetan's father ... after another observation, seems to be a gelding. Ben Ishaak is the only person who even has to make this film seem to be linked to the two previous in no way. It can be a nice family movie for some, but it is the biggest disappointment of my movie this year.
