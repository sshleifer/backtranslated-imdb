Speak like a real gangsta u'an boiled. The story is no worse than any number of gangster movies, but never confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. He is not in the same league. But what makes the movie periodically painful to watch is that these Italian Americans were spinning around bad gangster lines, in a fake and more accentuated focus. Pacino would have been great if he could call him. I was looking forward to seeing Abrahams and Loggia, but their stevened accents broke the fun. Well, the scenario is not too hot. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and putting him on his back all the time.
