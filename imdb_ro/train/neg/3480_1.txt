This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies of all time. I can not even imagine that Gigli is worse than that. Our predictions made us say "NO," but then looking for something in the middle of the distance right now, we decided to go ahead and shoot them. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. It's an image and can look good with explosions, but not even Bruce Willis entered Die Hard. If he stripped off his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys, it would be a comedy. The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini flopped again (if it was not for Sopranos, he would have washed) as he did in "Mexican." has any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.
