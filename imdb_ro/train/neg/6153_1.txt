So let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really bored on a beautiful day since 1997 and so I biked at the movie rental store. I asked the clerk of the worst movie he had in stock. Without hesitation he went to "Lucky Stiff". He told me he would give up the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to perceive more) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch me for free ... This movie is terrible. God - terrible even. I do not have to go into the details of the plot, read the other reviews. Banks do not make sense. The act was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupor of the main character was exhausting. You might try to watch him as something of laughter, but it is so bad that it's not even funny that way. Avoid!
