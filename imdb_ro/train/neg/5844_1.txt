This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not want to say that in a good way. We wanted to see horror / horror thriller, so I chose the one that seemed the worst in the store. For once, the movie was all we could expect. And other! (or should I say less?) The actors show that they are reading their poster lines behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing a red plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Do not even start my script ... And just when you thought you could not get worse, it seems the first part of the movie was Oscar compared to the end. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you are in terrible horror films, but if you want a good movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
