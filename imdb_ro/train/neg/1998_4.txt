My roommate got the soundtrack "No, No, Nanette" like a van on a tape and she kept listening to her non-stop. After finally washing my brain in obedience, I found that the pieces are irresistible, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But, rudely in the soundtrack, I had no idea what movie was about. The next day I saw a copy of it at the video store and leased what was supposed to be a long lost version of the movie. I thought it would be amazing, because the soundtrack is so nice. Unfortunately, most of the songs I've loved have not been found in the video we've seen. Now I have not seen the 1930s music version, but this version was unfortunate because there was a very small and practically no dance, and besides, the sound was very bad outside and you did not really understand what they were saying people for a long time. Indeed, the only evidence of this film was the scandalous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that sneak like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather breeze she holds on her arm from the front and then wrapped in this net scarf. Dance success is a little weird, and Nanette does this strange ballet with the face-up image superimposed over it. In fact, another brilliant spot was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a good artist, but now condemned to design girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps him in the old school and destroys Nanette when the masterpiece, which was to make her career, was sold by Nanette for a $ 5250 price. Does not he realize the song was his immortality? Silhouette rabbit / girl with rabbit feather ears on your hat. When will you learn? Why not the pencil just in a cigarette before the ad people take the job?
