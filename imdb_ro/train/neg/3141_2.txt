I just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids between the ages of 14 and 22 put the "Titanic" DVD into a fantastic home entertainment entertainment mega-screen business. Only two of them have seen it before. But they all saw Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the beginning of the epoch, they began to shake, some leaving the others - "call us when the iceberg appears." Over an hour and a half in the film, only the two girls who saw the movie before were still there. They started shouting: the iceberg, the iceberg. A follow-up followed, all returned to see the Titanic dive. They stared openly, issued Oh and away. So, as I thought when the movie broke out for the first time in the scene. What is this? An hour and a half are waiting for the bloody things to sink, but what about the rest. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar running time, but think about how much is taking place in that movie at the same time. In "Titanic," Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of creams from supposed creams in the first-class dining room of the ship. Look at historical details if you can find them. The story is so thin that it has to put guns and shots into a sinking ship. The real diving here is film standards. Every effort focuses on the special effects and the end of the opening week. The film has continued to become the biggest film of all times, so what do I know?
