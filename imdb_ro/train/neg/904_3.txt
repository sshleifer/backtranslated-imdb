Stella, starring Bette Midler, is a crazy runner. Located in New York, Stella Claire works nights as a bartender, pouring and dancing in a workroom. One evening, a medical trainee, Stephen Dallas, who works with Stella, comes in, and impregnates her business in the course of their business. She breaks both her marriage and abortion offers, sends her packed to a profitable medical career, and exalts her daughter in poverty.
