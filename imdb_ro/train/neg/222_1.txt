As a single woman for over 40 years, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning for single women over 40 years of age, not to mention every other woman of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and straighten a "chicken blow" and failed unpleasantly. Andy McDowell is not yet an actress, but given the non-existent "plot" (I do not really like to refer to her as a plot), she had no chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel compassion / empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any realistic or credible way. And then there is the obligatory masculine fantasy of a just, appealing woman who suddenly decides to try lesbianism - PLEASE. Not only do I want to recover my money for DVD rental, but I also want 112 minutes of my life back. What is it?
