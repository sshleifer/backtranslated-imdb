I saw this movie five years ago, and his memory still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware of how horrible I should have been to get into it, so I just have my fault. But, like most, I did not believe all the negativity. Being a fan of Sandler, it seemed inconceivable that one of his films might be so bad. I just thought Sandler just hated it. We could not have been worse. What we have here is a comedy that does not even contain a second of fun. This is actually an achievement. You would think that in a 90-minute comedy, it might have accidentally happened something even distant from the distance. But no, it's horrible. It's not "so bad it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. Wait a joke patiently that will make you at least laugh, but they never come. Have you seen the Ring movie? Where people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would instantly die with their hand and smile on their face when they realize their agony is over and this would be the first smile since they pressed the game. > <br /> You may be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to stop your curiosity. Do not. Please no. Believe me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think they are going overboard are the worst movie ever made and those who have not seen it yet.
