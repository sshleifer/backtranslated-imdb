The complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too bold for women. I'm fine with these night soaps, like Gray's Anatomy or Ugly Betty or West Wing, because there are interesting stories even though they will never end. However, when the idea is parallel to daytime soaps meant to put ordinary men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps and many ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called hospital little ... or a corresponding woman at Baywatch. That was what people wanted and they had it, so if that's what women like, but the idea that this is a great big show (or something people will forget) is unrealistic.
