Oh, where to start ... this movie was terrible. The writing was bad, the action was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but I certainly did not succeed! I thought it would be pretty decent, because I'm not pretentious. I watched some bad horror movies. Actually, my goal is to see all horror movies, no matter how dreadful they might be. At some point in the movie, I made a comment about "corn blood syrup" and the peculiarities that I actually recognize was Karo syrup (corn syrup ...). The film had all the stuff needed for a movie of horror (blood, nudity, crazy murderer, stupid movements), but he was just missing everything to do good. The writer should either take some classes, or give up!
