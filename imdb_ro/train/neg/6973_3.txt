I did not even know that this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy hidden deep in my dusty cabinet. The title on the box said "Insect" and the illustrations on the back have highlighted that it is just another insignificant and poor horror film of 80 years. Surely they can be fun, of course, as long as you do not expect a smart scenario and as long as you are not irritated to see a huge amount of cheesy makeup effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie watched worthy of trust is substandard here in "Blue Monkey"! The intrigue is ridiculous and very non-original, acting performances are painful to notice and there is a total lack of suspense. Following the popular trend of "big-bug" movies, "Blue Monkey" deals with a new and unknown insect species that destroys doctors and patients from a remote hospital. Manufacturers could not be more elusive about the real origin of this giant giant over size! All we know is that it is not from outer space and that it came out of a tropical plant. Besides, there is no explanation for the place where this new type of insect comes from! As I said, do not put your hopes in a smart scenario. The first half of the movie is quite fun, with some beautiful ghosts and the introduction of disturbing characters (a blind and 80-year-old woman!) But the second half (when the whole hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. It's also near the end that "Blue Monkey" starts to exaggerate older (and better) rip-off movies. Approximately the climax, they also appeared from the budget also because the light gets very poor and the guy out of the monster suit is not very well camouflaged. "Blue Monkey" deserves a look if you are really bored or if you really want to see the 80s horror film ever made. Cinema fans B can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns in the outer space", "Curtains") as Roger's small and meaningless role in the clinic.
