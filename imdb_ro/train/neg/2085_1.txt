This is one of the most serious movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have a super power to be able to enjoy himself, I think the film is in his 14-year-old fantasy. The bed scene was overhead and reduced an intimate moment into a hoax of biological functions similar to passing the gas in public. From the beginning, each other scene was a discussion of how few sexy people got there, how long they had been since they arrived, when their next sexual bond would be and who they should be. In addition, dialogue and acting were very weak and very forceful, they did not feel and filled their lack of content with terrible sexual scenes. This could have been very funny, because the concept is actually interesting, but it is badly executed here. Please do not even think of taking someone under 16 if you have to go and see it.
