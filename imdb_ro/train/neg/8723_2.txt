Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad film. It's a rarity, but hunting is not worth it. This Italian rupture has no meaning for too long, and the rest does not make sense. The "Alligator" is not at all convincing, and many of the sub-plots do not go anywhere. If it's at the local video store, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies but it's not worth hunting.
