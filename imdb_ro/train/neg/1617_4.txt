What an unusual movie. Absolutely no concession is made to "special effects from Hollywood" or entertainment. There is no background music, no special effects or improved sound. The facial expressions are usually covered with a thick beard, and the Spanish language is a weird, monotonous weird sound that sounds the same if it's in the middle of a battle or talking about a campfire. Have I seen these films (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really to go and have fun. It's long enough in the dull places. But I suspect that, given the lack of any development of the plot, I do not think it is too educative. perceive any story in the dialogue of the movie - it would be a good idea to read a little about history so you can understand the context of what's happening because for some reason the director did not consider it appropriate to inform the public why Che's band they move in the way they did - as a result, there seem to be groups that are piling up around the forest for no special reason and that they were shot. I would love to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing the depth of character, but somehow all the characters were still alien to me at the end. The stars he receives are for realism and to show the hardships of guerrilla warfare.
