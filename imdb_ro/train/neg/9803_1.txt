Power ranges are definitely the worst television show and the ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing fun about this complete television show. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with terrifying actors dressed in costumes with multi-colored spandex that looks totally ridiculous. The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves because there is no redeeming value for this nonsense. Today's kids should try to watch better shows, such as Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
