I'm afraid I do not have to agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee later a little boring! Though trying something different, not just documenting the serial killer's growth and fall, I do not think it went too well. There are too many things - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's relationship (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia. The story is good, but in the end it's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, Mr. Lee would not have put more in that part of the movie? > <br /> <br /> But there are some good points. All the scenes with David Berkowitz's "Son of Sam" killer look very good (color saturation etc ...), and the acting is pretty good all year round. Generally, I felt that the different stories would work well on their own or otherwise without being killed. It was not strong enough at last
