BTK Killer, the green murderer of the river, the zodiac killer; man keeps absolutely rubbish and the ironic thing is he loves shit. I have never seen a movie from Ulli Lommel, but I was so amazed at how everyone thinks his things are so horrible. Just like the movies I said at the beginning are not equal to six when I'm gathered! After reading the comments, I was curious to see how bad this guy is. He's the worst out there. Credits would not end as the pathetic film started and quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly reprofilated. The act was incredibly terrible and so did the photos. Editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I could not support it anymore because it will not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I could not take it anymore. I lost 45 minutes of my life. DO NOT SEE THIS CRAP!
