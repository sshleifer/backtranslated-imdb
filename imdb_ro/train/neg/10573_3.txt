I was subjected to this film for a class of relationships in my school. As you can see, nothing was exciting and nothing new. Although trying to be original, focusing on the teenage father instead of the mother, pointing to the problems that the father might be going through. It had an interesting part, but it does not come up with originality, because nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who likes it in any other movie as he has a thing against him, we have a mother stay at home who expects too much and when he gives more he feels offended and puts it in the dust, then we have the father who is always gone. Then girls have parents who want everything and expect it to be perfect at all. On this story I said it was interesting, but the lack of good action in the cast and the lack of any good writings or stories. Everything about this has fallen into a clich√©, the little kid in school begins to study with the little girl, meet, have sex and then the boom has a small child. Perhaps it would have been better if the writing had been better and it would have improved the acting. I've received a lot more excitement from Leatherface and its chain than I did from some actor in this movie, and that's bad enough to see Leatherface's movies silly and terrible. So far, the only interesting film about the task I've seen was Juno. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has proven to be more fun, while giving the same message. As I said the idea was original, most of these films focus on adolescent mother, but she did not choose to focus on the drama of her father, but again originality does not save this film from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides either to make this better cast and a better writer again, or to make another similar movie because it was a scattered potential.
