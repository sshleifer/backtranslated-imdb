This may be the worst show I've ever seen. Apart from the lack of a sense of having a sitcom about Hitler, it's simply not funny or entertaining in any way. It is very similar to a 1950s sitcom, in its humor of cornball and in controversial situations, but while it can be good in I Love Lucy, it's not even funny here. I think the show is based on the novelty "look, it's Hitler like a sitcom comic figure," but it just fell in every respect. The guy who plays Hitler is so weird that it's hard to sit down alone. I wonder what the network could do to think this is a good idea for air. I thought America had a tasteless show, but the British beat us this time. America would never make a sitcom about Hitler, although I had that show about Lincoln's slave, Desmond Pfeiffer's secret journal. You probably will never see this show because it only broadcast one episode and will probably never be released on DVD.
