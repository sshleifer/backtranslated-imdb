Horrible, Horrible TV Show! Why Comedy Central has decided to repeat the old episodes of this program is beyond me. It's really shit! I, of course, talk about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were gold and, if I talked exclusively about those seasons, this show would have reached eight out of ten. None of the comedy that appears after the first two seasons that were not part of the original cast is not good at all. They were and are terrible. Comedy is not funny at all. NOT AT ALL!!! The original cast was filled with highly talented comedians, such as Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name was), all of them should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV. This show is extremely overvalued and less worthy of channel navigation than Saturday Night Live, another horrible event. Get out on Saturday night and have fun and let MAD TV dry and die as it deserves.
