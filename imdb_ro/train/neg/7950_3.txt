Lumiere Cafe is a nudity beautifully photographed. Unknown to the director's work, I am well known with the director who is supposed to pay a tribute - Ozu Yasujiro. While not even approaching Ozu in majesty, Hou did not communicate anything about the depth of Ozu's emotion and focus on meaning in a closed space. One of the things he misses is Ozu's attention to character - not even "introduced" by his main character (a perfect page). There are no medium or close fires of his people. One of the DVD extracts provides interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Hou does not have - a good look at their faces. It was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing ever happens". This would be a much better title than this unnecessary exercise. Throughout this film, we are clues about an obscure composer from Taiwan, whose work we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, do not add to anything. If you're not a trainspotter, this movie has nothing to recommend.
