This is a typical Steele production, in which two people who have suffered some sort of tragedy manage to meet in spite of their chances. I would not call this spoiler because someone who read a novel Steele knows how it all ends. If you do not want to know too much about the plot, do not read it. The character of Gilbert, Ophelia, is a decent French woman who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert must stop making movies that must have an accent, because she, otherwise a good actress, can not resist realistically from any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who recovers from a rather ugly divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a baby mole only because he was talking about art with the baby. They all become friends after this episode, and then the couple falls in love. The chemistry of the two leaderships is not great, even if the talent of these two people is, in my opinion, not a question. They did everything they could with a predictable plot and a scenario that was limited to stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedy, a bigger tragedy, reveal a secret, another tragedy, then meet. I would have liked to have more than that, but there it is. I wanted to do mindless entertainment and I got along with that. As for the genre of romantic movies, it fails to be memorable. "A Secretive Adventure" with Janine Turner is much superior (not a Steele book), like some of Steele's previous books turned into film.
