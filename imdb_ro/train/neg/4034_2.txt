Ouch. but writing and directing is an art and writing wisdom and direct understanding is a bit of a task. Even if you make a good comedy, you have to take the right time. I do not put everything there, there were parts where I laughed out loud but that was very few times. The main focus I had on me was the quick dialogue that made some people get angry in the movie. It might sound very good while reading the script in the head but getting it and the room is a different task. And hand-held camera power gives some parts of the movie. The general direction was good, but the script was not just for me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head that it would be good. Sorry.
