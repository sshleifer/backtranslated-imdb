After reading many reviews, I do not know what a few people were watching, but it was clearly not the same thing I saw. This movie is horrible. The Act, first of all Moore, is just terrible. The woman can not act. Beautiful girls, but she can not act. At no point did she meet her as the current character. Instead, she was spoiled the Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play with the boys. And this is ultimately this movie - believe in Hollywood. The training sequences are above. Policy - over the top. Political fairness - over the top. The battle scene - you guessed it, above. Your mission is to get in and out without being detected. So, what are you doing? Why shoot as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I. Jane, you can always be a wing man. The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood makes her catch her, we get to Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What's to be expected from American commercial films? I do not think so.
