Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in costumes for the little girl. I like 50 news, I really like jumping 50-year-old cheese, but this movie is really bad. And not quite enough MST3K. Virtually undetectable as a pair of bosses make the best impression of "hip cat" by Abott & Costello. Chessecake can usually save sci fi cheese, such as in "Cat Women on the Moon," but can not in this case. This movie requires a mute button and a fast forward feature. That said I could look at Gloria and Dolores to go around the spacecraft for about an hour or so.
