Schlocky's horror film ... you have to love them. Unlike the boring films today, these K-tel specialties are actually scary and do not resort to a tired formula. This is a B movie about making a B movie ... who died terribly. Faith Domergue plays the role of film queen B, who makes a film about a series of huge crimes that have affected a family in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and acts as Gordon Jump with an attitude, filming on location and on a tight schedule. Co-star puppet Ken discovers a book of Tibetan songs that works in the script to add "realism." Unfortunately, "realism" is something that could have done without it. John Carradine, who has long renounced the search for the 17th Glen (The Unnearthly), is now exuding a humble existence as a real estate agent. He's dealing with his daily work, but he always seems to deal with the director. Horror slowly builds up; a dead cat here, John Carradine enters a tomb there, culminating in the seven, gives seven crimes. (At least there is truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the guy did not understand that a movie was made over him. How was Faith Poverty aware that those Tibetan dances would actually work? Do it, you just can not walk around pulling Satan's coat and wait for him to take him down. Sterno says he was performing an autopsy on the House of the Seven Corpses.
