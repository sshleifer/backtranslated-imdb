"Bela Lugosi enjoys his role as a European caretaker in horology (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this extraordinary story of horror and dementia. The old doctor's good wife needs fluids harvested from the young virgins to keep her youth and beauty so that the doctor maintains his supply rather than the alter, where he abducts the brides who do not ask before he can fulfill his oaths? "Sedating them in a state of coma brings them to the mansion to reap the rewards" the DVD sleeve synopsis. This short description is much more fun and more imaginative than the movie. ** Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell
