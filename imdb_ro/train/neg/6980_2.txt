History correct? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you look and the light falls on the subject just like that. But the core accuracy is not a compensation for a dismal, uneven and inconsistent plot, cardboard dialogs and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are only characterizations; the state of embarrassing stereotypes ranging from American Indians "enigmatic and noble" to British officers "clogged but sadistic." A miserable and unwieldy interpretation of a fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
