I went to the theater that she wanted to spend a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if she did not light up. I have not left either entertained or illuminated. This movie can not think of what it wants to be and it does not get too much to nothing. There are some funny lines and some incredibly demanding references to the movie (The 400 Blows - because this character breaks out!). While none of the characters are treated with much respect, over thirty homosexuals receive the worst thing: all those who are weak of ruminants, fat, sad. If you're in the mood for a gay relationship, check out the Parents, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You'll thank me. <br /> <br />
