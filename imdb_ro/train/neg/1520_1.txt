Why did I waste my time with this movie? There was no joke or funny line. The paper was not really funny. I mean, really, a suction pipe in a vacuum? Why was the name of the National Lamp attached to this movie? Even the Christmas holiday was better than that (actually, I thought the movie was very funny). YOU ARE LIKE PLAG!
