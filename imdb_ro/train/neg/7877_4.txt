Producers of this film have created a future where not only abortion and birth control are illegal in every state but women are prosecuted for murder and sent abroad to execute long prison sentences. In other words, this movie is the worst nightmare of liberals! the political agenda is so difficult to handle here, and the style of the movie is so low that it loses steam pretty quickly. No matter what part of the fence you are, I'd recommend to jump.
