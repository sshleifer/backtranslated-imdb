They are probably one of the few spectators who would not recommend this movie. It's amazing that all of Ang Lee's work (every frame still looks like print), I was really disappointed with the film's dissociated rhythm. It was really too long. The story is set in Missouri in the Civil War, and it's about a young man (Roedel) who joins the fierce forces of the Bushwackers, a sort of Confederate renegade supporters who run the geurilla battle with Jayhawkers, their counterparts in the Union. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, starred by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot and his house is burned, probably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedel and Chiles' adventures and interactions with other war victims, including the former Bushwhackers slave slave (Jeffery Wright's Daniel Holt) and a Jewish war widow. /> It seemed that every time the movie developed the story at an interesting point, it would turn into another subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the excitement of Roedel's group caused by the former Holt slave who participates in the confederate's case is briefly shown through a property and protocol conflict and then abandoned until later in the film. A young vilian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs him with a lot of aggression and violence against him, but we never know why. Some characters seem to never seem; I think this is due to the fact that the film contains too many of them, as well as the taking over of large amounts of history. Historical details were excellent. I liked to look at homes, furniture, clothes, etc. and I thought the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, though they were a bit preoccupied with the dialogue. If you do not enjoy history or you are a huge enthusiasm for Ang Lee, make a pass on it.
