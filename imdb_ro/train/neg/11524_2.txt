Pretty incoherent film about a man who belonged to and left a hippie hippie religious cult in the 1960s who struggled with her sixteen years later. The man has one child with one of the other culturists who, during a police raid, is hidden and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in the city. It's hard to watch what the characters are or how long the scenes should take place. The leader is paralyzed sixteen years later (I got it out of the box - I missed my time in the movie). No one is made to look older, not obviously anyway. A murder is done with a large circular sawing log, others are made with knives or crossbows. I have never heard the name of the title character mentioned in the movie, but he is the one who upsets most, hooting and hollering. The movie is patched together quite badly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were very bad. A man is perforated and we hear the sound of a cracked whip. A woman burns a gun and we do not hear it, but you hear a ricket! It does not seem to have been done for a comic effect.
