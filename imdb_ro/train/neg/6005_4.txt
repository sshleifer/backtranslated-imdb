This is a classic stinker with a cast called the great, especially the seniors, who have been well past their past and bedtime in this. This movie is quite depressing when you think about it. Stay on the earth and you will face sickness and eventually death. Gwen Verndon showed he could still dance. Too bad the film did not focus more on that. Maureen Stapleton, in search of the haggard, still showed those steps from the "Queen of the Star Dust Glass Ball", much more so on earth 10 years ago. I hope this film does not encourage the seniors to mass suicide at Jim Jones. How can someone be idiot enough to like and say that makes you think? Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? If the seniors did such a wonderful thing in the end, why was the child encouraged to get out of the boat? Why was Steve Guttenberg a jump? After all, he found his love. <br /> <br /> It would have been a nice movie if the seniors had managed to find their fountain of youth on the ground and stay there. Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, in this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and Mr. knows who else has disappeared. Writers should have taken the script and placed it on this group as well.
