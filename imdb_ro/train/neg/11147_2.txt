I have nothing to comment on on this movie It's so bad I had to put my first comment on the IMDb site to help some viewers save some time and make something more interesting instead of watching this movie. .. anything you do, even looking at the walls is better. And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I also tell you that it's a low budget movie, bad action, name actors, a bad mutant like wolf, and so on ... Also, the story does not bring anything the special effects are made in the style of the 80s. The film is almost as bad as the film "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So, have fun! ;) (do not watch this movie)
