Have you ever noticed how Burt Reynolds's later laughs sound like roaring rocks? He must have been hanging with Hal Needham too much. And from the look of "Stroker Ace", WAY too much. Can you think this was based on a book? I could not, but it was. And probably not a best-seller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is an old boy in the NASCAR circuit that approaches Beatty as a fried chicken tycoon with drawings on his team. Anderson offers what love interest exists and Nabors makes Gomer Pyle's impression of being a mechanic believer / best friend of Lugs. <br /> <br /> A lot of people here are friends of Burt or Hal. Others must have needed work. And even the real NASCAR drivers are in touch with this act and they see they have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As for laughing, Bubba Smith (pre-"Police Academy") receives them as Beatty's driver. And Petersen, in the way of Elvira, receives a lot of appreciative people like a lady who wants to know the Lugs very well. REAL WELL. It's a shame that Burt has cast as much time and effort into a movie as "Stroker Ace" where it does not matter whether he has bothered to act or not. They did not bother writing a character for him, why bothering them to act? Two stars. Mostly for Petersen and for the outings at the end. They're funny now.
