Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this performance does not compliments him at all. The character is not at all enjoyable at a distance, and it is not a situation where you think she is "so strong that I love her", but she is so strong. This character is just a simple old self, understood, b * tch.Sarah seems to struggle to have to perform this show, because she is the only semi-amusing in her. The mood, the dialogue is just as boring and dry as listening to your grandfather and continuing with the marble he has gathered as a child. The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I was thinking of changing the channel to watch old reps of marriage with children something that is funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude." I'm sorry, but I do not find a dry, humorous show on the lines of the story wall about an angry, bitter life with her annoying and gay sister who sounds like Keanu Reeves with a cold somewhere close to amusement. she resists this show, although she generally finds Sarah Silverman as "I love her because she is such an ab character," as in School Of Rock, and most of it gets up. boring with characters who think they are understood and say and do things for the shock value eg. constant pockets, diarrhea, and generally laughed for laughs. Sarah Silverman's program tries to be fun and fails, whether it needs a laughing track or better writers. Some have compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. opinions about the Sarah Silverman program and will not become an annoying troll, which means you will not even see me ab 'tch and constantly posting things like "This show sucks" and "Why is not it canceled yet" . such as the Sarah Silverman Program if you enjoy.
