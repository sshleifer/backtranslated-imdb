- I planned to write something to explain what I did not like about this movie, but that would be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I do not remember much about it. I saw it three days ago, and it made almost no impression to me. This is usually the sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was that I was incredibly bored by the majority. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart looked like a quick-witted detective. It would be different if she could act, but she is an entertainer. The killing scenes were amateurishly manipulated and there was no suspense to take them to them. If you can not call the killer for five minutes in the movie, you have to see more euro terror. Casting is proof of death of the killer's identity.
