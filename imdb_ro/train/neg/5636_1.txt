This movie was the worst I've ever seen. It does not seem to have a plot, but the time when you realize that this is far beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to look closed for a long time to recognize the director's total incompetence, that is, laziness that plays the chicken and we do not think Willem Dafoe in this movie is a clone, because true Dafoe, as we know from "apocalypse now" and "bacon saints," would never have agreed with such a scenario . Duh, (Yes) wrote this project twenty years minus his child. This film starts with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, then the two scriptwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, then the Colagrande director. Bottom line (story); The widow meets the guy, the widow of the old widow, the widow breaks the windshield with the guy who hit her. Title in the Netherlands; Black widow (different title, same stupidity). DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It's a total waist of time!
