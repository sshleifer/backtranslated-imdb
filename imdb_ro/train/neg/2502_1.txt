However, another hard die directly to the rip-off film with cardboard sufferers ?? How many of these terrible, inexpensive (and stupid) gods have made the most popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s still hidden there? To record (not that you really care) this is another blatant shot of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a complete complement of cliches and predictability. <br /> <br /> The aggressors without description are the usual selection of gun-cut cardboard, which is shipped in various ways as the movie progresses, the hero is naturally a former cop or something with family problems and attitude, and of course brings along with the party only the usual emotional baggage, but also a suitable piece of eye candy and his annoying son. The supposed subject of a luxury cruise line running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between liner and ferry? this goes some way to explain how it seems to be larking around on a railroad railroad rail ?? in New Zealand! The act is as woody as the deck, the script brighter, the unique predictable paths, the totally inappropriate villains and the plot has holes in it you can navigate a boat through. There seems to be never the end of this kind of direct breaking into video trash pollating the late night slots of television and DVDs of supermarket fairs everywhere (although even this film is so bad, has not yet seen it DVD version, but give it time!) Is there any chance of doing anything at least half of the decent, semi-final and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought I did not ...
