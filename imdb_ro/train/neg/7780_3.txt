I could barely prevent myself from stopping or stopping this flock, but I decided to take it out, only for the reason that something could happen. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What seems to be a lot of actors, either lightly hammered or just lights and no merit, and scenes that seem to repeat like ATTRACTIONS in the water monument in the waters of the river (oh, and what a luck a woman happens to be stripped of it ... even if there were already disasters!) This is a great thing, but I suppose it's not too damaging; is not very unpleasant at least and once or twice we are receiving a semi-interesting visit to the Brazilian "culture" (who is the father who goes through the city with the flock or other parts that resemble "hey, this is not America!" ). But any hope of the director at the casting of Mitchum or Carradine is scattered in the best case of pedestrians, and in the worst case, the terrible and banal dialogue. It does not help us that when we finally have something of a good look at the monster and "action" happens, it is also staged stupidly and with only unlimited appeal. I usually feel sorry for a director who had a lot of trouble getting a special shot - in this case he took the best part of the 70's, but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever is called ... nah. > <br /> If you encounter the double DVD feature of Elvira DVD (bad print with poor quality of transfer) with Blue Sunshine, be sure to skip this. If, of course, you are not Elvira dead and you can not help to hear her humorous commentary; personally, I would prefer to take Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this roasted turkey.
