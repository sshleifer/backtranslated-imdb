It had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 and I have a football fan. I was expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes ago, I began to wonder exactly how a bad movie (especially the acting one) could have entered a theater. Almost halfway, I whispered to my husband that he was terrible and explained the facts behind the film. Although I was a little offended (and I can see how some might be offended if they were not Christians) in their preaching at a cinema, it was not such a big deal. It was, however, a big business to be subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the act. It is a suitable film for a church trip, but to be presented in an audience of the church and not in a theater. Am I going to the church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie? Not. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
