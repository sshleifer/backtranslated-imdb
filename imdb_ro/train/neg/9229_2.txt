This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies can be fun, but they need something to do it. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr Coppola has not inherited his father's abilities, unfortunately (nor his sister, who can make movies that one might look at). I wonder how this movie came to get such coveted reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the male actor, alleged director, is as expressive as the frozen squid and his voice has the same values ​​no matter what he says, the full female actress has an expression on the face that never changes, the plot is completely segmented into bits with a single linking element, the film in the film must be older than the Paleolithic rocks ... Would it be enough? I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is a fun much superior to this incredible blade movie. It's like a plot by François Truffaut was directed by Dick Cheney ... Brazil, other classic SF movies? You have to be joking ...
