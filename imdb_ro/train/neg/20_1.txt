This movie was terrible. at first I read the fence summary and it looked OK, so I looked at it. The act was TERRIBLE. it was like the actor were a little shy. everything seemed fake. I feel bad about Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago .. I've seen it at least 20 times .... the plot was also carp. writers were probably sleepless when they came up with lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's a good kind of bad movie. the one you always keep to see how much it will be worse, so later you can tell other people how you can not believe how terrible the movie was. I think everyone should see this so we can better appreciate other REAL movies.
