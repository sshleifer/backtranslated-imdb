I recognize this movie just as being 3 unfortunately because it is trying to deserve it. I like to boast a wonderful movie and I'm not biased towards "masculine" movies. The legal blonde was an excellent movie. Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic film shooting at worst. until the end of the movie I did not care who lied or something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good STORY. This story is weak and does not grow (just because the subject is profound, does not mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that has a major character change and is ready for that change throughout the movie. In Georgia, character changes were steep and underdeveloped. Second, there were too many dynamic ATTEMPTED characters. Drawing a dynamic character is very difficult and takes time (you only have a few hours in a movie). This means that too many attempts by dynamic characters will receive too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story, and the bed of poor dynamic characters, I can not even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. It's good if you write American beauty, but not when you try a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a mother and a terrible daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (she would not cut her any weakness because she was molesting, it's happening with everyone and all of us we are responsible for our actions). The Dudley Do Right Mormon child would have had the courage to not compromise his religion and commitment ... and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy allows a 17-year-old girl who has been molested to remain casual (if not an actor or a politician). This movie is worth watching if you want to remember what a good movie is not!
