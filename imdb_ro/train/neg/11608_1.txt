If this guy can make a movie, then I can really do one. In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise you to do the following: <br /> 1) I will add more empty women. This movie did not have one. I think horror movies in Class B are leased only because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let the viewers down. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from doing too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out that it's just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, since the movie was just one long hour, the film-length ratio was quite high. And if I decide to make a dream sequence, I'll make sure the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who's sleeping in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not break any movies like Star Wars or Matrix, because you know my budget is small and I will not want to masquerade contempt for high cost movies at Hollywood by adding of satirical references about them in me. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean a palm pilot can be so scary ... at least it turned him into a bad-polemic monster before the screen exploded or something else. So if you look above the qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie extraordinaire.
