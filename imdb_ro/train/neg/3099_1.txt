This film is not just bad, not just corny, it's repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the terrifying little girl about all sorts of movies (and I'm using the word literally), the film is making a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. This movie makes my crawler, makes me regret that I have breeding organs and makes me feel unclean. One of the things that bother me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that produces fantasies with disastrous results rather than "Worst Nightmare" and "Overdone Twisted Wish," is a really fascinating film idea.

Explain.
