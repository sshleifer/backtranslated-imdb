The movie was probably made in the 1930s and released in 1931. I would have surprised that the motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era. However, this plot Zane Gray seems to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper probably just learns to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable under current standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, it is not acceptable. Some of the actors did well. Unfortunately, the Indians always receive the short end in these early western wars. They lived on the earth long before the white man came, but, according to twisted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
