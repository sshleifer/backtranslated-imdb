Although a movie with Bruce Willis always deserves to look, it would be better to ignore it. I watched it on TV, so I did not have to make money. Lucky. The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite credible, it is becoming more and more incredible to the end. It is very questionable whether a soldier led as Lt. Waters would not follow the direct orders. And even if it were, if he did the rest of his platoon. They know they are directly threatening them and know they will surely die if they follow him, but what the hell he is our Lt., so do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). <br /> However, there are some beautiful scenes in this movie. They somehow save a village where the total population is massacred by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen villagers or so, the rest has already been killed. The weird part of the fact that they took the trucks the rebels left behind. They rather walk down. Perhaps because the roads are unsafe, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think this was what the movie won a point I gave. What made this film an insult to the brain and therefore it is unbelievable that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being injured or killed. They just lost a few comrades at the end of it. And that's just because you have to fight an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that? He is fighting with so many army, kills hundreds of them and loses only a few of them. And they have rounds and ammunition. Never get out of it. Grenades and clay mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff? Do you wear it or what? They even have a laptop that shows them the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts for days. Really? Who believes this shit. I think if you shut your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this. It saves you time.
