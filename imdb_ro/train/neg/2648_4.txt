I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos's work, and MacMond's Magda Macdonald's photo in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I was watching this movie. I've never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived idea about it. I thought he started with a nice start with Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as a secretary he does not know it exists. The scene in which she appears at the costume party in the simple angel costume, with a non-cooperative hall and wings that will not remain, was really enjoyable. I was right with the movie when Eddy sleeps and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while he started to fall for me. Eddy remains "asleep" for the rest of the movie, so everything is a dream. Whatever happens there does not really matter, because he just dreams. The rest was quite a lot less and useless. I had to force myself to stay with her. And the last number in which MacDonald goes from a musical number to a musical number in a mad hallucination was simply weird. If Eddy "woke up" faster and the original story went on or if she really married an angel, I think it would have been more exciting. I wanted to see more about her real character. There were not enough musical numbers to call him a musical. The first songs were good, but the number of jitterbugs made by MacDonald was like a nail on a blackboard. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing what the real stars were.
