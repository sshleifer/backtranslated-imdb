Your mind will not be satisfied with this trial thriller, but pray, who is it? A young couple spends the real end of the world in the hidden lab of some aliens who deal with church people. Small trip, apocalyptic theme, END OF WORLD has the ingeniousness and lack of both brilliant style and style in similar 50s films. And not only that, but EOTW plays as a hybrid, not only today, but also in the monastery. The villain of the film is a well-known character actor. This unscrupulous slapdash seems a monastery exploitation, a significant musical genre in the 1970s, which today seems to be so amusingly obsolete. However, the secret lab of the monastery is a nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of the end of the world; but the end of the world is no pride at all!
