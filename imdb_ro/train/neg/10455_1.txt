25,000 pyramid hints: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slide. Eight legends legs. Pyramid Category: Movies that were more fun and thrilling than snakes on an airplane. Hell, this definition had to include Ted and Elaine's trip on the plane too disturbingly! as superior to the Serpents in both laughter and emotions. The sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all intentional amusing funny snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to never seeing JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer's casting in the same movement, you have put Jon Voight to shake off all sorts of cinema thieves. Its final scene itself is everything SOAP tried and failed to make it as a "so ridiculous-it-fun" movie. Eventually, Snakes on a Plane is definite proof that executive studios and fans make the worst possible collaborators. Every big scene has been discussed and dissected so much in the last year, all that was left to amuse on the opening night was the amount of flop-fanboy sweat that had to be washed at my theater. I've heard more forced laughs than at a studio recording "According to Jim."
