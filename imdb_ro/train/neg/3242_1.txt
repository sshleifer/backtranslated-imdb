Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I dropped popcorn on the screen and resumed my entertainment at MSF2000. The plan is based on random occurrences and is based on stupidity from people who should be intelligent. Lead falls for a con man and does not happen to her that she can conned ????? And she's rich ???? And is a famous psychologist ????? Come on good people. She gets into the bar at the most convenient time when everyone is assembled to talk about conning them ??? It was such a scene that it felt like a slap in front of viewers even half. The man of the rain would have been insulted. I also admit that I disdain the Mamet dialogue with the passion that some have for those who eat meat, for warriors and for furriers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'm gonna hit him. That it should not sound real is good. I do not care. It is that everyone talks about SAME. Mamet can not create characters; all he can do is push our uninterrupted voice through different actors. No wonder his actors are so woody. They are confused about the fact that everyone is the same person. (However, his subsequent movies are improving.)
