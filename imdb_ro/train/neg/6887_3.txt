Still another "son who will not grow" and just the other recent similar. Heder in another evil wig, channeling Napoleon for what, the third time? Anna Faris is forgetful, as always; Jeff Daniels called at least from the other state; and Diane Keaton ... how can one get this way late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here, which has not been covered many times. I'll say that; is about a hundred times better than "Do not launch". There are very few funny bits in the movie if you do not think the curse of Eli Wallach is funny. Ha, Ha! He is old and escaped the F bomb! Tee, hey, hey. Pitiful!
