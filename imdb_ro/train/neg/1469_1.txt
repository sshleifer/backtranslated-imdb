As if watching summer movies of summer camps, "Indian summer" is a sleep induction. Eight graduate camps are just introduced, when incredibly dull flashbacks start for characters we know nothing about. Good actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this movie. Observing a camper that "everything looks much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you overturn. Anticipated frogs are not fun or original, unless you think short sheets are a real "thief." This movie was a great disappointment given the ample talent involved. "Indian Summer" did not make me make home, just sick. - MERK
