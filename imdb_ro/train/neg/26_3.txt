Assuming that this will not lead to a direct launch, I would have to say that this title is canceled at any price. Unless you get bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. I saw that last night at AFI Dallas and I left 20 minutes left, simply because I did not care (about the plot, not the insult of the director ... that's weird). When you can see a goof in just 5 minutes in the movie (a shot, a broken window before shooting fire ... and then the window breaks with the first photo), things will get worse. Let's just say that this is just an indicator of the things that will come ... unfortunately. I will give you all the details, but this is sub-par in any way, even half of Michael Madsen is disappointing when you expect a half of the acting contest from him. And the scene of rape ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
