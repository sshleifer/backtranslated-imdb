I could not believe how blades and useless it was. Basically there is nothing to laugh in the movie, hardly any scene to get interested in the rest of the movie. This movie was shot in some huge stars, but all was wasted in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves has to take some acting lessons a few years after this movie before looking at The Matrix. Uma Thurman seemed very simple and humble. Fortunately, we received this film at a very low price, because it certainly is not a movie I can remember for good reasons. I will not write anything about the story of the movie, but how should you know that she must be the most famous hitchhiker in America because of her big thumb. I would give you a 2/10 movie. Before watching this movie I was wondering why this movie has only a 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing film. Do not buy it even if you see it under $ 5.
