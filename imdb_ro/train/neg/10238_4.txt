This movie seemed to be good at first, but never managed to wait. The director is talented and has good angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but he does not know how to create or tell a good story to go with her. The story was fragmented and seemed to have disappeared in all sorts of different directions throughout the film without finding a solid, explicable and interesting angle. Actually, the film never matches the explanations in the press releases. But the actor was really good. All actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was remarkable as it always is. It's too bad she chose to make such a weak film.
