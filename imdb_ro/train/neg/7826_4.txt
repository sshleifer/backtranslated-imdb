Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. No Significance. This movie turned Superman as a meaningless hero, a hero without archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, he was nothing but a Hulk. Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among other things. This still does not solve the problem that this film has no depth. I can not see how anyone can come up with anything significant from this movie, when Superman was and is being created daily to be a significant hero not only in comic books but also in people's minds. This was a real loss of money, given the number of directions this movie could have. Only a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on. It was just another incarnation of Hackman. And Superman? Why did he stay in this movie? Nothing but another salvation "Savior" figure. Wait until it comes to the dollar theater, if you do not see it at all.
