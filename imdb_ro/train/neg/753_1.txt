Wow ... I chose this at Wal-Mart local, after reading online that it was released early. I've been watching this online for some time, and I had to buy the movie. Wow ... I think what really hit me was editing, or missing them. From time to time, the characters (usually the Narrator and anyone with him) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can cut off somebody who leaves point A to show him that they're coming to point B. You do not have to look almost all the way! Wow ... I've come to feel somewhat bad for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction on what to do in other scenes than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date. Wow ... Why was it decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM sometimes uses thumbnails. One of the most distracting uses of the green screen in this movie is to constantly rush (depending on the final credits) the same group of people representing the citizens of different cities and cities, including London. Sometimes these people are approaching and do not go with any point of view about the angle of the shot or the distance they have from the camera. In a single blow in London, there appear to be at least two men over six feet behind, just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not from GETTYSBURG, I saw such a piece of fake facial hair. <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines spoke this movie as he did is beyond me. It's a turkey, simple and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) he gave me some of the most authentic pieces of hilarity I've seen for a long time.
