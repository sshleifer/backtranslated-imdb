This is one of those movies that you think producers would refuse to release because it is so terrible. Obviously, they thought the kids were stupid and they were excellent to absorb endless ads and would think it was fun because it was fun. What's with the Wendy, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles buttons? The cartoon was not a spoken car. (Dr.) Claw should be bad, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everet "Claw" anyway? Were the drug writers writing these scenes? It seems they were (ill) enlightened Robo Cop, with transforming a man into a fight against android crime. I've been trying to get my money back, but there's a policy where, if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you do not get a refund. I'm sorry I've seen more than 30 minutes of that bunch of nonsense. After I was told the reimbursement policy, I decided to look at the rest of the nasty garbage, called Inspector Gadget.
