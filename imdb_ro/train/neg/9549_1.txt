I wondered why John Wood did not play with Dr. Falken until I looked at the film. Complot BAD, bad science, bad action and, in general, a bad movie. Do not look at this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. I did not like the bending of the plot to defeat the idea of ​​a terrorist threat. The first W.O.P.R film was built because Russia had 1,000 focussed focuses on the US. In this movie the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists in training before it was a threat. The policy aside, one of the best things about the first film, was to point out that even a stupid computer could understand the idea of ​​war useless in the end. There is no such perspective in this movie.
