Trash / bad movies are usually not bad because I will find them nice. This is so bad that I have no words to describe it - below "bad". There is an instruction at the beginning of the movie that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say that the instruction and a dozen beers could not help me stay in the whole movie. A tagliner compares him to KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obvious. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. If you think about renting it, put it down! If you think about buying, do not think! If you have the bad luck of having this dvd, do not play it, throw it into the trash can immediately.
