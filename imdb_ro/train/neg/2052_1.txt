This waste of time is a completely useless remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added, other than Perry's fulminations, which have a marginal interest. She lacks the documentary sensation of the first film and the urgency of the first that made her so effective. Quincy Jones, who adds a lot to the original movie, is also painfully missing. I can not understand any high rating for this. It's pretty bad. Why does someone lose time or money, doing such nonsense and why did I waste my time looking at me?
