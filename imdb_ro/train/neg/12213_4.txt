Like the "first blood", this is trying to make an idea about the treatment of veterans in Vietnam, but there really is not much time for that between monotonous weapons, burns, stabbing, torture and explosions, Rambo impossible to indestructible, of Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, a variety of vehicles, and everything else can point it to a rocket launcher. The only woman in the midst of all these toys for boys is soon overturned, allowing testosterone to reach dangerous levels, and the scenario degenerates into a succession of loud noises. Easily aiding some musical milestones is Jerry Goldsmith, who thoroughly scrutinizes all the topics of the Russian Rat-a-tat in Chinese ching chang chong, unless we understand what we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty stupidity is under him.
