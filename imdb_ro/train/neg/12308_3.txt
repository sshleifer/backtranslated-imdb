Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd have failed to save this film from setting an Emu size egg. Based on the classic film series Phil Silvers, he bombed himself because: A) It was updated in the 1990s and B) The simple premise of the TV series was transformed into a confusing, weak and stupid scenario. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray amiable characters acting in simple and hilarious jumps. To expand this premise in a 1990 movie, he asked for problems and looks. No one could pay me enough to stay secondarily through this stomach.
