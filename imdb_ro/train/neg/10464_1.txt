This film is not based on the Bible. He completely leaves Christ out of the film. They do not see the abduction or second coming of Christ. Not to mention that. He does not quote from the scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. The film does not even show heavy times. The seven bowls, seven villas and seven trumpets of judgments pour into a 15-second news distribution of the sea changing the structure. The Antichrist was killed 3 Â½ years in trouble and so the film ended. The only part they had correct was that there were two prophets. They did not use the name of course, because they would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part was that I wanted to be a good movie. I wanted to take the unsaved. I feel the movie is bad. It's counterfeit, just like everything the devil does. I hope it will not get away from the next movie, based on the left-hand books. The second problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Evil acts, bad bad effects, evil plot and weak character development. I've seen several episodes of vice in Miami.
