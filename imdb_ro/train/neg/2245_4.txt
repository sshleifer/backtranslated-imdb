This film is not the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and this is a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I have no neglect of Barbra Streisand's talent. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with other Kris Kristofferson's works and I can not judge it. However, this film leaves much to be desired. It's the slow pace, it has free nudity and the wrong language, and it can be very difficult to stay through. However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's normal to like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 movie with Barbra and Kris and judge for yourself.
