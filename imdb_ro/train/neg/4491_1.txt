1/10 and that's just because I'm not going down with my ratings. Jump over this movie and wait for the latest Trilogy movie, do not buy it or rent it. Believe me, you will not lose anything. The architect does not bring new information: _ (spoiler) _ there were more NEO before him, he is like no.6 or something. you could already imagine this from the first movie: Agent Smith tells us that the first matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where have I seen that before? Oh even in the first film rolls where reversed! like scenes of action is nothing new with just a few opponents. The action scene (the 20 ships) of the BIG battle I have not seen (perhaps in the Revolutions?), Betrayed by someone (maybe the guy who kept the knife who wanted to kill Neo?) EGM -button soon. Everything was a shameless thing to make money (especially from boys who went to see it more than once), which obviously worked like a charm.
