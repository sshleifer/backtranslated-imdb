The minion is ... a little, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose purpose is to obtain the key that will unlock the door where his master is caught. He is a kind of demon possessed by human beings and when the body dies will possess another. Anyone who possessed will go on a berserker fury. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a Templar secret order, who has the task of keeping the key away from the minion. The film begins a thousand years ago in the Middle East, where some Knights Templars are fleeing the minion. He then beats in 1999, where the key revolves somewhere underground in New York. An archaeologist is instructed to study / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say that the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long hunting scene between the minion and Lukas and the archaeologist. The film is just a low-budget movie in the B movie. The film has no energy and has just traveled. You will follow the pursuit, but you will never feel involved in the story, which intentionally takes ideas from previous films (especially The Terminator films). The battle scenes with the minion are disturbing, for you have never felt how good or bad a demon is a warrior. She "skillfully" becomes a unique army when she struggles with a Templar team, but she is a vain when it comes to one. And it should be around for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is just thrown down for leakage for comfort. The whole idea of ​​a Templar secret order, a door in hell and the key is not well explained. We simply have to accept that they exist. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but just enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren seems to want to be elsewhere. Verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
