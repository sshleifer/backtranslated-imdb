*** May contain spoilers. *** If I live in Tokyo time was a bold experiment where in real life wanna-actors were given the film pieces, provided they would be needed to take a combination of powerful anti-anxiety base prescription, anti-depression and antipsychotic medication (this is the classic psychic combo that makes patients ring in the zombies) throughout the film, then this movie would have a much greater interest. Or, if film production was another type of experiment in which all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be easier to explain. actors without life, without energy. At the scene where the new husband was standing on the stairs talking to his sister, he seemed to have trouble opening his eyes. In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with each side of his body motionless. From the beginning to the end, facial expression is best described as "close to sleep". It's not about actors who speak across lines, because these actors can hardly end in any dialogue line. Everybody talks with a depressing, monotonous voice. Do not laugh. No hoarseness. No force. No one has enough energy to smash a smile. The result: Full and total boredom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> /> <br /> Better to watch GREENCARD that has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional story of Japanese romance, visit MONASTERY VACANTA that has a great deal of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not do.
