The DVD version is composed of 2 episodes, Caesar's paris being conjuncture. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. So it's hard for me to thoroughly review this movie because I did not understand what was said. Cleopatra being a historical icon, the part is very difficult, and I found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela plays well. She has strong will, but also a very good soul mate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode. So it is not a documentary, not a peplum, but a great love story. After paris, there comes a new boyfriend (Marc-Antoine), but the flavor has disappeared: we always remember our first love. So I discovered the second boring episode and their tragic fate is not being said forcefully. However, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; the live location of exotic marocans and splendid cupboards. Manufacturers have a lot of safe money but do not spend anything for special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx) that it's funny. Finally, I would very much like to hear in French or English to make a definitive view of these two films.
