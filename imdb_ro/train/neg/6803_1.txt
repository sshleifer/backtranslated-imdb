When I find myself on IMDb boards, I'm sorry when I saw a "worst movie ever" post. After watching this movie *, I think I will soon create my own post !! <br /> Opening Titles: Big, a kind of zoom blades on a gas furnace (yes, focus on fire = explosions = action film packed!) Actors: I think Ice T is a great rapper, even an actor nice (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Seagal Steven as the policeman he's playing is ... beyond words. The rest of the distribution is ... Well, I do not know where these actors were hired, but I'm sorry! I bet my dog ​​would have been an actor much better than them! Hijacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I said, well, cool! At least there will be some beautiful pyrotechnics ... He was dead wrong. The rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent rent photos taken from the Air Force ... Dialogues are hilarious, music is pure prey, the end is happy (I mean I was happy at the end because the movie is over !! !) My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted (I am 22, she has 42 ... well). was about to take the film and burn it. Maybe next time I'll follow ... (who never said?)
