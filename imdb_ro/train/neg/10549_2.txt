Film is a difficult business - because decisions have to be taken and everyone involved has a private life. This is the original thesis of this poor attempt to make a movie about the film. Indeed, there is no better proof of the industry's wandering than seeing Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell caught in this inability. The prospect is made up of bloody speech heads that "I should make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I do an indie article and stay honest with my artistic self?" - Please, the second. Or: "Our relationship is not only professional but also private. It's a pretty complex situation to solve, is not it?" - Yes, it is, my dear. Among the insipid dialogs are palm trees, hotel lobbies and American film posters (no signs of non-American film on Croisette). Recurring sleeping sessions are inevitable, making the 100 minutes of the movie feel like ages. Jenny Gabrielle is awesome to justify her own presence in the frame.
