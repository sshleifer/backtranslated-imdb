... through the similar antique of Eric Stanze. A very talented director did not manage to shoot a particularly good film, yet I still woke up to the closing credits, if not for nothing but to see what was happening next. A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After capturing her (even if she voluntarily came) and threatening to have sex (another event she wanted to do), he revealed that she had kidnapped three guys who had wronged her in the past. Then she decides to kill her (huh?), But she is hindered and dies in return. The girl's face collapses (or something like that) and takes her anger out of the unfortunate creep in the basement. Okay, the writing is deserted: it's long, loaded with ten cents, and there's a lot of it. The actor sucks: what minute, what action? <br /> <br /> The movie is crap: the home movie is pretty bad, but 20 minutes of cemetery material is just a cursed insult. And the budget is a joke: take it ... "budget", which was punchline. And yet, there was a charm at work. In the 1970s, these films came to theaters with real budgets and talents, but not these days. If you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually explosive trash (do not lie, some of us do that) then everything you get at the moment. A few short shots of hardcore in a sexual scene, fecal material torture, axle fun, anal rabbit with a broom stick and a long blow of the crazy chick masturbating with the same silk stick are some of the best items in the menu . will not be remembered, but not from the beginning of Joe D'amato people have made such films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
