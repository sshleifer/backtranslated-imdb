Blank Check is a movie I've seen on TV one day and most of the movies she's filming on Blank Check TV was not that good. First of all, nobody I've ever met has seen Blank Check and includes people who grew up in the 1990s. Also, Blank Check will not be detained in 00, either simply because it will be shaded by pixar movies. I would not call Blank Check out a bad movie, but not too funny. (Or at least not for anyone over 6 years old) Check Blank is not an entertainment movie because nothing about it is original. Everything makes you go "what have I never seen before?" Blank Check breaks out and tries to win everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which strangely both have Macaulay Culkin in it), Check Blank is not a bad movie, but it deserves to fade into obscurity.
