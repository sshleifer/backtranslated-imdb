I totally agree with jamrom4 .. this was the only horror movie I've ever seen. The holy nonsense was terrible .. I was warned not to see it .. and I crazy I saw anyway .. about 10 minutes in painfully I completely dropped the pursuit of atrocities .. but it stood until the end ... just to see if we could .. well we did and now i wish i did not have .. it was disgusting .. nothing it did not happen and the end was all the preachy movies .. not that bad has the right to survive .. I urge all of you to spare you the terror of the fat driving the bus .. if I had only the same caution the same warning .. you save yourself from this movie ... I have the feeling that those who rated him were involved in making the movie ... and they should be wiped off the planet.
