The story is absurd and blades, also sucking are performance and dialogue, it's hard to keep your eyes open. I advise you to have a caffeine-friendly friend who wakes you up in time for a couple of Gore effects. Why do I bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes more and more difficult to swallow. Over time, I wondered who wanted this movie? Chit full of sublime blades (like the American cannibalism of the army captain) This is low-grade in every aspect.BTW this film is banned in Germany!
