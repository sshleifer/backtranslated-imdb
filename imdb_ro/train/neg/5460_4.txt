Curiously, season 6 of the Columbo series contains only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two scenarios, based on this man-in-the-pop tour and also "Fade into Murder." On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both of the scenarios mentioned above (incidentally, he plays the role of the security guard killed here). This adventure is rarely convincing, and many of the performers only seem to be disinterested in the material. The story is quite poorly developed, with some prolonged periods of boring conversation. Columbo is also shaded by a colleague here (similar to "Last Salute Commodore"), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste's Holmes' characterization, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughs. The scenario revolves around family history, and the murder is enough to give Columbo, although there is never a credible discussion of the reasons for her murder. Ironically, what is undoubtedly the most serious adventure of Columbo, produces the most amusing moment of the series. He tests a male hairdresser and has a hairdresser / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed, then he can not afford to pay the bill, and when he asks the jewelers he keeps looking in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment in a scenario that shows that it was cobbled together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for the Columbo Communists.
