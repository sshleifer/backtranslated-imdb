This film reminded me so much of "The History of Violence," which was supposed to be a thorough study of violence and violent behavior, but it became nothing but a cheap action movie that behaved like a film about thinking about violence. Dustin Hoffman and her new British bride move into a small English city and face endless harassment by local drunkards who just do not have to sit at the bar all day and trouble. Do not these people have a job? However, Dustin does everything he can and by the end of the movie he gets up in the house and struggles against each of the drunken attackers, through some terrible means like boiling whiskey pours on someone, his legs being pulled by a rifle and some being caught in a beast trap. Funny that someone would need such a big trap in a small British city, except that he put a mans head in it. Sam Peckinpah who made the "Wild Bunch", which also covered the subject with blood allowing violence in which no one was spared. But it was done in style, and you believed. Straw Dogs is not credible. First, the location is wrong and it does not work. Why do you put her in England? I was thinking maybe in a location in a town in town or in a small South American town in the 1930s or something like that. Secondly, it is not in my opinion ever explained clearly why these people are so quick to violence except they may have drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on This.
