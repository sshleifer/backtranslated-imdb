The United States seems to run the police in the United Kingdom, ran around the armed to the teeth, and you know that CID officers turn into uniform when they stop working and go to the bar! This must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst UK "real" police portrait ever shot by the public who can not wait. I can see that Mr. Snipes might have needed money to pay his fee back, but what the hell a good actor like Charles Dance did in him is a mystery. Worse than the lower B budget of the 1950s. One and a half hours of suicide and time I will never come back. Avoid it as a real plague.
