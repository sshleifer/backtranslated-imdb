No, I have never seen the "Santa Slasher" series, meaning "Silent Night, Deadly Night", "Original Christmas" or "Bad Christmas". I've heard everything about their reputation or MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I'd rent the one I heard as a reference on a "Fat Guys At the Movies" segment. /> <br /> Mothers should be against this, but not for Ooooohhhh's "killer," but for the fact that this movie was just stupid. Bored, long? even at only 92 minutes, nonsense. The kid sees Santa Claus in 1947, gives a present, eats some good and, miraculously, floats in the basket. The boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to confess Mummy and Mother (somehow). It seems that this has hurt that child for the rest of his life, although the scene was just as dizzy as when Ralphie's father received the "Leg Lamp" in "A Christmas Story." He was disturbed, went to the attic, and cut off his hand. Fast to the future! Now it's about 1980s, and he's been beaten in a toy factory. We have a headache, being a bit traitorous, and he treats both children and parents. Who's naughty, who's beautiful, blah blah. Do you need two-thirds of the movie to help it in the end? as if this is not prefigured from the first frame. NO MOVIE should last so long. I will admit that this film had the tension, but only because I expected to do something, anything for anyone. When he finally does, punish "who's naughty," it's as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I did not mention WTF termination. I think it's a metaphor, but in reality it's as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who bothers his brother to kill, and his solution is to kill.) Do not open this mess right on Christmas Eve, or bad. Again, I did not watch the other "Santa-Slashers," but he was badly angry. This has generated suspense due to the nature of the movie and never gave a decent gift.
