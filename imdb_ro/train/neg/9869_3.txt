He did not care about the film, the book was better. Does anyone know where he was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. so I look like a fake now, but I think I'll send my comments. and yes, British Columbia is wonderful *** Or why did they get it from South Carolina Coastal setting? (this question stays) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the film. I read where I need to write at least ten rows. Here's the other main issue with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too vague and not at all what I imagined from the book. I know, the book was the book and the film; not too well. I found the character in the book more empathic. The book also evokes rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" of the movie was more visible, it distorted the story and appeared to be in contradiction with the characters.
