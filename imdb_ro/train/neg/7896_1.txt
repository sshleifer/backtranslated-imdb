You do not know why this movie seems to have received such craved reviews. While watching "Bang" one night on TV, I was awed by the nonsensical, random plot that happened on the screen. The whole film does not seem to be anything but an exercise of self-indulgence without meaning, artistic, and farce from the director. The fact that the director / writer goes through a name moniker only strengthens this feeling of pretense. <br /> <br /> Those interested in indie movies would be better to look for something better written and bold to say, more fun than this complete loss of time.
