"The seventh sign" borrows a lot from Rosemary's "baby" and "man" (the two stories actually mix). Even his title reminds Bergman's seventh seal. begins to be pretty good, with all the remains spread all over the earth and in parallel with a plot distinct from Moore's husband, trying to save a sinful boy (who killed his brothers and sister parents) from the death penalty. while the Christian and Jewish religions are called to salvation (even the wandering Jew is involved), which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (you've ever been to Sunday school, but they taught me that God was love!). the IMHO scene is a brief dialogue between priest John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, too badly that he was not given a more important role because his unwelcome attitude is invaluable - and the young Jew. Demi Moore has probably had the same desire as former husband Bruce Willis: saving the world. the movie for all this.
