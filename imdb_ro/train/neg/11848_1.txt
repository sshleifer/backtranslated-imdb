What should have been a simple mystical plot involving a dead philanthropist is actually a story that causes headaches about a bunch of characters (the only big actor being Ginger Rogers in a very early role), all trying to find a killer in a small caste of inhabitants in a separate building. These characters vary from one absolute level to another. As a cheap and inexpensive production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and his leader (a guy, I do not care who he is because he really suffocates) talking about their different possibilities to solve the crime, cut by an absurd detective with his head in his ass. Frankly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-type movie of this type and I've seen some real kidnappers. Oh, and the butler did not, because he was not a butler. But attention to the type closest to a butler. That's where you go. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
