I just came back from a free screening and I'm glad I did not pay to see this sub-par film. The theater was full, and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. They seemed like the kids were laughing at all the palm and farther benches (yet a good god liked to hit those poor rats very much!). The film is quite juvenile, unintelligible, predictable and, moreover, annoying. The characters seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space, and the relationships between them seemed very forced, with no charm at all. From a visual point of view, the film is on average with nothing that really does not come out. They have done a decent job of mimicking the look of clay from Wallace and Gromit, but besides, it's an amazing picture. Although I was really bored throughout the movie, I chuckled a few times. It's not an absolute failure, but I certainly would not want to see her again. If you are a parent with children (and do not care that your children see cheap money jokes), then feel free to take them to see them, but everyone else should not lose their money.
