I thought "Intensive Care" was pretty bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's somewhat suspense, but never a good shooter. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD Fun is in ridiculous moments. But the classic moment is: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. She sleeps in the corner of the hall. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks, "Poor Peter, will I help you?" This film was shot in English and Dutch. To save costs, all license plates are US, and the background in the news studio is a horizontal line in Manhattan. Very fun if you are Dutch and look at the original Dutch.
