This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half long, it feels close to 4. I have never seen a movie moving so slowly and without a purpose. This is also a "horror" movie that takes place over the course of the day. My friend and I have laughed a number of times when we probably had to be scared. The only thing we want to know is the reason why a terrible movie has been released in so many countries. It can not be so high in demand. Supermodel Nicole Petty should stay on the model, because although she's beautiful she has lost her accent so many times in this film, half of her time is British and half time is American.
