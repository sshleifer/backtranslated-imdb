First of all ... I never thought of a Uwe Boll Hater because I think I did not even see one of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (which is the name of the killer serial related to this movie) I'm close to going into the hate club. This movie has absolutely no meaning ... intrigue is a joke and although Boll is clearly trying to attract the attention of shocked people 90% of this movie is just boredom. You can summarize this movie as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. The trap killer follows clips of animals that are tortured on television. This is a real record of life on the pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason to "make a statement about humanity" and give a Peta address. Since this movie has no message at all and is the worst part of pornography-exploitation of torture, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Electrocution death, with a pretext that takes away what happens later in this film printed on the screen so that each delay gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Politicians watch videos of animals, children and women starving in the basement of seeds, having bad nightmares and crying in whiskey, because Seed is a bad mofo bad. Although the action is fine, the movie sinks every time it tries to incorporate any emotion ... 4. The bust of the cops Sits in his house, acts stupid and cut in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game that you barely see anything except the flashlights. The semen is a super killer who is all over the same time and all the cops act stupid enough to be killed ... except for the one who bombers him. Seed becomes the chair and we see its electrocution as long as anything else in this "movie" ... he will not die and he reminds us of the opening statement that he must be released if he survives 3 electric shocks. Guess what ... bury him alive to solve the problem. The seeds come out of the grave, kill them all elsewhere, and then look for the chief policeman to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gives her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from a point of view, just for the fun and the value of the shock. <br /> <br /> 8. The semen captures the family of policemen, attracts him to his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After he killed his wife with a gun, the cop shot in the head, considering that Seed wants to be difficult to get into that head when he was not just wearing the mask in prison, but he never spoke a word ... the film has any dialogue anyway, so do not bother it). <br /> <br /> 9. Boll goes for an end of Nihilist shock if Seed blocks the daughter with her dead father to rot like the people I've seen on the video on Sequence 3. This is ... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background, except for a stupid story that Seed was burned like a child. This film is based on just a few key scenes and their shock value. I hardly remember a naked movie of any emotion, message or entertainment. It's like looking at Underground August ... that's good with me, some people will enjoy this brainless brain. But what is really hard to understand is the pseudo-message from the beginning and the fact that the movie is well done in terms of working in the room, the effects and even the action is too good for this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> So how do Boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors are working on buticings budgets? "Seed" is not just the essence of ridicule, the living proof that the free market is faulty ... Uwe lucky that the German taxpayer pays for many of this waste to get deductions.
