What a terrible movie! For some reason, laboratories and scientific outposts always have a dirty, dirty, deceiving person who lives inside. These people who probably work together on complicated scientific projects do not seem to agree with how to survive death in the hands of a CGI dragon. Spoilers: An extraordinary ugly scientist, whose main acting competence is "assassination" and "sinister opinion," cloned a dragon. While the lab should have been working on such things, the other scientists are shocked, because they seem to have been completely behind in their experiments and trapped with their pants down. The rest of the story is "THE THING" or "Ten Little Indians," where staff are hunted and killed in an attempt to create a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon." The CGI Dragon creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI effects. It's hard to look better than a cartoon, and dark-colored tones make it hard to see interesting details in the Dragon's body. Everything seems to be a gray spot. The actor is less than horrible. These scientists behave like a bunch of kids who can not agree with anything, and that makes Dragon easier to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the casts of some unknown actors this movie. It seems to be sinking at the level of his filming. This movie is indeed really atrocious. The act is bad. The story is bad. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing commendable about this film, it is not even a good killer of time to look at while doing business or other work.
