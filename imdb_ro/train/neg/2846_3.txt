What a terrible movie. The only reason you would like to stay in this mess is Miss Eleniak's pleasant vision. Mr McNamara's painful cover, which has sometimes become embarrassing, has damaged what could have been a reasonable film if the right actors were thrown away. Mister. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants.
