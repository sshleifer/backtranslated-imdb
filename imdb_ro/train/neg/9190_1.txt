This is by far the best movie I've ever watched. I've seen some terrible movies in my time, but that's what the cake does, wait, I'm talking about the whole bakery. It is so bad that I think a word that describes how you will feel after watching this atrocities has not yet been created. Please, do yourself a favor if you ever need to look at it and look at thirty minutes of that annoyingly purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply it thirty times and get only a small part of it the horror you would be in store for. In conclusion, I think you can really name a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be dissatisfied with the worst business deal and a totally useless story. Disgusting
