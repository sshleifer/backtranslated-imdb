This movie fails miserably at every level. I have an idea to take everyone involved in this movie and send them to a hot spot in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, everyone will be shot and killed and we will not have to waste our time. Did I say that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic heap of nonsense all my life? God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen is so bad. I prefer to watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than to stand in 10 minutes of this evil excuse for a movie. If I meet someone who was involved in this movie, I spit on their face and then knocked them off. There are two cents.
