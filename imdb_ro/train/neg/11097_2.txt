That's exactly that Saturday's matinee series that I loved during the Second World War. I was under ten years old. And this is the audience for which this series was created. Now looking at him, we have to fight them in inexperience and stupidity. The budget must have been close to nothing, given the shortcuts and repetitions. The actor? Well, here's the republic pictures, 1944. They read the lines .... and no doubt they had a step to make them convincing. One and a half stars.
