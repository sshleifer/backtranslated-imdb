I'm a fan of Shakespeare and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh did to bring Shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers. However, this film fails to convey the general intentions of the play with ridiculous musical sequences. Add that by preventing Alicia Silverstone from talking (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in "Much Ado About Nothing") and other misplaced roles, all equals an eccentric viewing force.
