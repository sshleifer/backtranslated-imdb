I realize that the American army was demoralized until 1971, but this movie was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the SS punishment battalion in a novel by Sven Hassell. The writer must be a real ugly of the Army. The sergeant psychotherapist, who continued to beat people's shit, belonged to a prison cell, and the useless black sergeant needlessly should have been dismissed. These people were going abroad, the reception units would have been wondering where all recruits who were not affected and who followed an investigation would come from. The scene that exploded completely was the shock wave. Farrell, the supposed advocate of the bar, would have had a barrel instructor to issue an illegal order (to torture prisoners in contravention of the Geneva Convention), the real attack on an enrolled man, the sexual aggression and undue conduct of an officer . Intead leaves. After that, discipline brakes in a level of insanity, and the film becomes undiscovered. I do not know how it was over, I slept.
