I can not believe, IMDb really has all the television programs known to man! I have not seen this show in over 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I just remember them. I remember that Tony has not been from the beginning since one of the episodes I remember is the one where everyone tries to get Tony to join but rejects them, but usually at the end of the show becomes a Power House member with all the joy. The other one I recall is that Lolo, for some reason, claims to have died (complete with funeral and funeral). I do not remember why playing dead or how the show ends. This is one of those shows that I have convinced you must have dreamed of, since no one else has heard of it.
