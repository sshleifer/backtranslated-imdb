Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Film. This movie is a piece of shit right from the start. It has a "true" plot, "really pathetic" and "so-called" special effects. Some "thirty-year-old" post-adolescents are trapped in the forest with a reptilian, reptilian, rubber outfit who is hiding endlessly. What you get with this movie is a lot of discussion and a precious action. You have girls who walk through the woods talking, and then you have boys (with a heavy mascara on) stroll through the woods talking. Everything is so boring! The creature itself is seldom seen throughout the movie. When shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows it to be a suit, hence the reason for blurring and distorting the image. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie in ANI from the word and those here who have praised it are most likely the people who were taken off the street to "act" in this really stupefying movie ! Jump over that for sure!
