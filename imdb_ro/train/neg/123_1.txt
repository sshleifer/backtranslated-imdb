Oh, brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for a couple of years, all I can think of is that the old song Peggy Lee .. "Is that all?" ... I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the US I was too young to enter the theater (though I managed to get into Goodbye Columbus). Then a watch at a local film museum made a mark - Finally I could see this movie except I was just as old as my parents when they were naked to see it! The reason why this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity triggered by his release in the US. MILIANS of people gathered at this stinker, thinking that they would see a sexual film ... Instead, they received a lot of Swedish meetings, repeated, interviews on the street, in mild malls, political claims. who deals with sexual scenes simulated with wild actors, palms. Cultural icon, holy speech, historical artifact ... Whatever it was, throw it away, burn it, then throw the ashes into a lead box! <br /> <br /> The aesthetics of the elite is still wandering to find value in its boring pseudo-revolutionary stories. But if it had not been for the censure scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. /> Instead, the title "I Am Blank, Blank" has been repeated for years without ending as a porn star (I'm Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I Am Curious, Black - for blueprints. ) and every ten years, things rise from the dead to be seen by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "naughty sexual film" that "evolved into the cinematographic industry ..." ... Yeesh, Avoid like a plague. Or if you need to see it - rent the video and move quickly to the "dirty" parts just to succeed. <br /> <br />
