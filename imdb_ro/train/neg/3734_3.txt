A really misunderstood mess. Most things in the movie look more or less like 1987, but then there are only futuristic things thrown away, like the gun of the policeman. And that car! The director seemed in love with colored lights. The only really notable performance was that of the girl who played Valerie, but since there was no listing, I do not know what actress it was. It is worthless. Grade: F
