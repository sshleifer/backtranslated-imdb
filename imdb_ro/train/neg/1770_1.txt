My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Of course, in the top ten of what I've been watching so far. At least "Plan 9" was nice. I really liked "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other films. I did not care too much "Cujo" (only because the sound was so bad on the versions we saw and often I could not say what people say) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". > <br /> But this clutter was a total mistake in every possible way. The "creatures" themselves seemed designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense for 9-year-olds). Even the "tools" made us stir and do not distract from the distance.
