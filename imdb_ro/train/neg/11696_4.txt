I started looking at this movie with low expectations, actually I noticed just because it was an adaptation of a S.K. Roman (a novel I have never read). I'm glad that my expectations were low, because the movie was not nearly good but managed to keep you interested. What truly escapes this story is the work of the director and actors. The film is too long, it does not have "beautiful" photos and no scarecrows, the dialogues are bad, and the special effects are nonsense. The only good things are that, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think the book needs to be good) without using a lot of horror clicks. My vote 4/10.
