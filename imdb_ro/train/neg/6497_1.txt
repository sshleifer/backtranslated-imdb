In fact, I had great hopes to get into this movie, so I took what was given to her with a grain of salt and I hoped it would be good. About one-third of the way through the film simply had to quit, the movie is simply a mish-mash of things that happens without apparent reason and everything is disconnected. I like the movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected. You do not think he's David Lynch-esquire as anyone would think, he's nowhere near that kingdom, except some exaggerated visuals. Saying it is artistic to hide that there is no apparent plot or story is not just a way or justifies why you lost 1.5 hours in the movie. The act was good, but that can not save the story. I agree with a previously posted comment ... "it's like being in the head of another person ... while being a drug," in other words, nothing makes sense.
