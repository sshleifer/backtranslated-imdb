Now, here is a film that, if done in Australia, it would have been a comedy easily. Unfortunately and annoying, here it is, flaky and cheesy and overloaded from the Lala earth. How did the di-erector make that wrong? Well, mainly, being serious about a job so dizzy that no one in the right mind could take it seriously. Unless, of course, they were a homosexual gay cliché (but somewhat cute) ... or is that cliché on the cliché. No value in the story that looks almost like a prequel at GERRY Gus Van Sant ..... and with a title like FLUFFER how is it like such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have a soooooo crazy he did not get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to do his own. Convoluted and undeveloped in addition to the theme of "unprecedented love of an envelope" left from a streizandist verse, we have only a drop of beef and a story at the television level. A fourth necessary act of this excessive turgid drama is really terrible as the movie wanders as if Gerries breaks out and stays there. In Oz at the end of the 1990s, about 20 years ago they made a similar but actually hilarious movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as VENUS FACTOR, he also suffered from a more horrible carp than Orson, so they re-filmed half of it, received a ruthless TV editor to cut him up and down up to 72 minutes and hey -presto..comedi, tonight! A lesson there when bad movies turn well by tightening. I think FLUFFER came into play and after seeing it does not work, I understand why.
