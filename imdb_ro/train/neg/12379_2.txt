Based on the positive reviews above, I saw a free review this last night. Now I know that filmmakers are planning positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these things. "Destined to become a" classic cult "" ??? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and families of the production crew, because only a few of us came out in the first hour. The songs were the most literal I've ever heard in a musical? "do not take the short cut, dear, there is a wolf in the forest ...". Debi Mazar's eyes furiously snapped as he tried to sing. Fortunately, most of the songs lasted only a few rows. Now everyone who plays the wolf in this story should be charming and seductive. Instead, we take Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer, living up to his last name because he does not get old. He is not too lazy with extra 50 pounds and high-school high-school makeup and out-of-tone singing. Seriously, this guy was in the vocal group? The other actors are semi-sufficient, but they can not do much about the inimaginative scenario. You know, is it possible to write for adults and children at the same time? see under "Pixar". On the positive side, virtual sets seemed beautiful and well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash".
