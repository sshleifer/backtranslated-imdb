An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho-candy during a night-time meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who attacked plan and perform a revenge attack on their attackers ... A piece of repellent, repellent, repetitive, somewhat sad-like sub-Michael "challenging thinking" drama Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been running if they were made so easy in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrible and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose into every last globe of his sexual instinct. His room is flames on Anderson's naked body both during and after the attack, while the script leaves almost all the characters cast into a large herd of two-dimensional enamels. His scenario forces the characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer from "victims", pushing more terrible situations before them (Adams' attacks on AIDS and Alice, Alice's attack on Heffer after suicide - The temptation comes from the central protagonists - Dyer is a horrific actor, incapable of light and shadow as a young male victim of the initial attack (will reach Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. and ridiculous, it somehow offers an extraordinarily convincing and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to take revenge. A terrible and useless movie, almost but not quite rescued by a firm performance central feminine.
