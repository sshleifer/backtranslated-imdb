I have a pity of people who shout kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them we're wearing is tollywood! comeon guys .. this movie is a thriller without excitement .. go out of humor and just look at some high-class thrillers like regular suspects or even laughter silence. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> But technically the style of kamal does not look like a police officer, there is no enthusiasm to be pulled and boring to the end could be saving 3 the valuable hours of your life if you're skipping this movie. <br /> Kamal at the best is the best of tollywood
