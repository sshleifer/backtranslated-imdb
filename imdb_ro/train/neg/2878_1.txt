You do not see this movie. Poor action and bad effects. A total loss of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cold crimes and hot chicks, but the director depended on the animal slaughter videos to shock the supervisor. Disgusting. The murders are quite bloody, in fact strangulation. A woman makes worms in her mouth, one puts the hamburger on her face and strangles her. BTK = broiler BTK, the new sandwich "killer" of the burger king .... ha ha. I do not think this movie relied too much on actual facts. I mean, BTK's real killer was not wearing a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh ... and a slaughtered cow's head. Realize.
