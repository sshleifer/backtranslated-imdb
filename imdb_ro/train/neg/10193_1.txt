With this film, Bunuel manipulates the spectator with all the power of the film, while clearly stating in the film that his work is "objectively". Obviously, it is not. For some reason, many "clean-shot" scenes are obvious settings (when that "salty" goat falls out of the cliff, you can see the smoke of the right arm!). For another, hiding him from important information: the Hurdes people were as they were for a certain reason, which has just been suggested in the film. That is, stomach, a disease caused by lack of iodine (salt). This goiter is the cause of their cretinism, and Bunuel only had time to do his research (heck, if he checked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary he had found "goitre"), maybe he would have come to tell the truth about these people (still doubtful). Instead, with his film, he constantly judges them, talking about them as "cretins," again and again, dramatizing action, setting scenes to create the show, all of which are unacceptable to a documentary who claims to work for objectivity of all power. Bunuel speaks all the time in this film, without leaving a word to the people he is filming. Talk to them, and even then judge them. This piece is erroneous at its roots, its ideology and it's a real shame is considered a wonderful movie.
