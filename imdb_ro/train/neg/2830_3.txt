If Ashanti was a serious attempt at a movie about the slavery institution, still predominant in third world countries, the film could have been better received. Instead, it turns into a discourse of a movie in which the stars have entered, their lines have been told, and their salaries have been tightened without much conviction. Michael Caine and Beverly Johnson's wife work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian work in East Africa. Together comes Peter Ustinov, who can barely summon enough bacon in him to make part of the role of Muslim slave dealer. As Johnson is black, he grabs, anyway, with many children and a few adults. Of course, Caine does not accept kidnapping badly, and the rest of the movie is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif, and Kebir Bedi, Indian filmmakers, who look so incredibly bored. Typically in something like these talented people like the ones mentioned above, they will survive strangely and celebrate a landscape diet. But Ashanti does not even have an idea about it. What an incredible loss of time. The flavor of taxing is permeable to air.
