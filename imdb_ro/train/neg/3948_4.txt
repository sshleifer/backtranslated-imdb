This is not the nasty video, but just because he went out in 1994 when he was probably tired all over the UK. It's 75% a remix of The Boogeyman and would have been forbidden for the same reason - no matter what it was. I was initially confused, believing that Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different to Lacey, but she was a person the psychic vision of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film. Fans will notice immediately that I am not the same person. After seeing a murder in a bath and also seeing her address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a par psychology student who very much resembles the guy on cheap love novels and butter commercials, go home and with safety, it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later, a murder happens as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this sick woman is or why she was killed. Then the film is heading for a resumption of The Boogeyman story with some extra pictures that I have not seen in the original. In particular, the boogeyman is shown unlike the original. Unfortunately, some good scenes have been cut, but 90% of them are there. Why do we get back on this movie? They found the movie in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and despite the fact that the psychologist tells Annie that she is cured, we all know that the bogeyman will never die.
