Always enjoy great movies that deal with the super-natural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film stopped me in terms of production and direction. There is nothing to be deeply debated about what this story has to say; all I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, had a remarkable performance in his home country England and I saw him in the TV series "Still Standing". Heath Ledger, played the real bad guy and I recently saw him in Brokeback Mountain, 05, gave a great support role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair) has done a good job of seducting a priest in a church that has not been recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
