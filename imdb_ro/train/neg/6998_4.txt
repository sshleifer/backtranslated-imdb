Hollywood always had trouble developing a "religious image." Strange Cargo turns out to be an exception. Although he uses the talent of a superb cast and was produced at a top-of-the-line budget, with Robert Planck the right photo, the movie fails with a credible score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of the fantastic elements affects the spectator's involvement in action and the fate of the characters. It has been hard for me to stand apart from all the metaphors, parallels and biblical references, impossible to accept to know Ian Hunter in the light, knowing it as a figure of Christ. And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence have at least agreed with me. The movie was forbidden. Few filmmakers in Boston / Detroit / Providence, if any, have complained or traveled to other cities because it was evident from the trailer that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in a "message of message." It was flopped everywhere. Very strange, the movie enjoyed something to relive on TV. An atmosphere of home seems to make the allegory of the film more receptive to spectators. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Stranger Cargo runs along predictable, strongly moralistic lines that will have no suspicion of how the main characters will happen in the last with destiny.
