This series gets 2 stars only because it puts Dickens' movie "Bleak House" and maybe someone will read the book. Contrary to what is likely to be the opinion, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. It was weird and woody. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martin. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr Jarndyce. So I will interrupt and respond to all those people who say, "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his assessments on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of a bad act if you read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is an acceptable Jarndyce (though too old). The series fails not because it's unfair to compare it with the book, but because the different plot lines and characters just do not collapse to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious, and comprehensive entertainment. She is bored and paid. If you want to do a good thing like Bleak House, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 episodes of two hours. But I suggest that producers, etc. leave Dickens alone (even a Christmas Carol). Television is destroying Dickens' genius, as shown in ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.
