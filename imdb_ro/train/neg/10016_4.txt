"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of most of the 50s movies about adolescents who meet supernatural. In this case, adolescents can not pay the rent for their hangout and can be evacuated. If there is no one else, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you probably guessed, once they arrive, some strange things happen. And there is a twist at the end. There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's still a nice entertainment. My favorite character was the parrot with the dirty mouth. Well, let me repeat that: he did not speak as a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but said things we do not expect from a bird. The film is pure hokum but harmless.
