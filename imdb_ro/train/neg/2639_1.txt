Let's first start this review with the fact that I only signed to write the poll and the war people to save their money! This was one of the worst pieces of garbage we saw from The Hulk. The story was the most predictable trash you could come up with. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, wash that waiting in the toilet immediately with the money you will use for a ticket. You can get more pleasure that way. The act was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" in the end.) I have to say this ... The end has surprised me, I do not mean the breath of the plot that surprised me, but how they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the whole movie. They rushed to end so fast that I did not even realize that it was over until I saw the credits that roll up and at that moment I considered burning the film drum if I could figure out how to I'm going into the screening room. Casting was terrible for a few reasons: first, they must have accidentally changed the characters because Michael Douglas played the role that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland ought to have played. While Douglas sneaks around agents, touching phone lines, hacking into systems, and pulling out people watching him, Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in the boss even if things do not go that bad for him. He plays a very gentle agent, nothing like Jack Bauer's guy told us 24 fans. I can promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. Can be best compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "In the Line of Fire," but written by people with mental disabilities
