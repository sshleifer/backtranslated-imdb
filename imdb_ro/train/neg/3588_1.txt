The 1973 Walking Tall follows the real-life drama surrounding the Tennessee sheriff, Buford Pusser, but this installment plays as a TV blade movie. Bo Svenson takes the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but is too gentle for the role; he comes as an amazing country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. The good actors supporting Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui are very little. I would give the movie a star with strict intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy table of routine issues, and production is cheap. Followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the television film "A Real American Hero".
