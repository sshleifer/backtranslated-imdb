Since the most recent reviews of this movie are several decades ago, I would like to add a recent film, the movie was opened with Germany's B-17 bombing film, the film was sent to Haustmann's character (captain) Wust and Oskar Werner the actor who ran to the cover as he headed for Hitler's FÃ¼hrer Bunker, after being informed by bunker staff, the film was then cut into one of the many conference scenes, with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression to Adolf Hitler, Victory, "while Werner's character is shown to try to realize that the denizens bunker is trapped in a fantasy world - some non-bunker events are described, the most notable being the flooding of the underground system to hinder the Russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak unit and the difficulty of his family to survive - ilm suffers from a series of detailed inaccuracies that a German film made only 10 years after WW2 were not included; the actor interpreting Goebbels (Willy Krause) bears the same uniform as Hitler, including the weapon eagle - Goebbels wore a brown-Nazi uniform with harness banding - SS soldier carries the camouflage of the German army, well-documented Hitler's scene, the boys at Hitler's Youth are shown to have taken place inside the bunker (it was made outside in the yard), and ultimately Hitler's suicide weapons are clearly presented as a Belgian browning model 1922 - the majority the account agrees that it was a Walther PPK bit of action also seems to be totally inaccurate with the dance beat scene near the end of the movie being notable, this little bit is presented as a skit cabaret with a drunk soldier drunk (his arm in a staff) maniacally goose-to-go to music while the Assistant makes a combination of striptease / belly dancing, all in the candle light ... in fact, it's embarrassing to forget - the most unbelievable is when Werner wins a single audience with Hitler's Hitler, Hitler is shown that who has begun to ask Werner's character, starts shouting Hitler, who brings in a SS guard, who wounded Werner's character in the back with a seal - this scene is not based on any true history - Werner's character is taken off to die in an anteroom, while Hitler prepares his own end, the goodbye Hitler's fugitive Hitler's smoke turns slowly into a ghost picture of the faces of the dead Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust - this film is more allegorical than the historian, and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent movies, such as the 1973 "Hitler: The Last 10 Days" In "Downfall" (Der Untergang), if he wants a more accurate account of this dramatic story, the last two films are based on the account of first-person witnesses, the "Hitler: the last 10 days" beer compiled from Gerhard Boldt's autobiography in quality a staff officer in the Fuehrer bunker, and Downfall from the memories of Hitler's secretary, the play "Der Letzte Akte" is taken from Michael Musmanno's death paper, which is more a compilation of the story of an event ) than eyewitnesses - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's account, "Hitler's Last Day", has never been filmed.
