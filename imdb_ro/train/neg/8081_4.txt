One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it begins to become satire, is that it is somewhat plausible. I think an anti-matter bomb would do far more damage than what was intended. But I'll leave that to the physicists who could have seen the solar crisis. It is a crisis facing the earth, because solar failures are completely useless. It is approaching Earth so much that it has become unusually hot, as if the whole Earth were the Valley of Death. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that a spaceship will have to take in the sun and explode there. This will remove the missiles in the direction of Mercury, offering that it is not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who to deliver, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That happens if he can keep his mind about the business at hand and not the fugitive son, Corin Nemec. The personal aspect of the family's problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation that, in this crisis, is trying to control the world's supply for survivors. The idea that he can not survive does not come into his thinking. He does everything in his power to sabotage Matheson's mission. The solar crisis seems to be a bad combination since 2001, a Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to take the courage of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he is the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and is upset accordingly. The rest cast are steady, true blue and boring. Except for the possible desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares about him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film was directed by the well-known Hollywood flop producer Allen Smithee. The film becomes as much as four stars for the distribution involved and came out in time for a Thanksgiving sculpture.
