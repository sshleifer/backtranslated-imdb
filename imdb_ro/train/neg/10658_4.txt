On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (our minds, three of us hardcore Kamal fans) among us have come to a unanimous verdict; VV was bad stupid and because of the movie, we were going to destroy ourselves on Monday. Not to mention, I swore to stay out of the theaters for next year. I will not blame Kamal for giving a clue to a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (Vijay TV). He said something like "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Scenario, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema grew in terms of Photography and Editing, but I did not manage to When we look at VV, those words are very true. <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj < Harris Jeyaraj I just abstain from using excerpts here, but in fact, HJ mastered ("remember" Anniyan "," Ghajini ") with cursed cacophony, he is billed as music background. The next time I transplant the tympanum, he pays for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film looks like it's made up of four very long songs, with several scenes in between. <br /> <br /> 5. A Short gone too far. VV, at best, is appropriate to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus "thriller". To use a cliche here, such as the Energizer bunny, goes farther and farther; only in this case you do not want to do it. The later part of a movie resembles a great love. <br /> 6. Joining Kamal-Jothika Two ice cubes rubbed together could have produced more sparks than this pair of lead. There is no reason to root them together. In fact, every time they meet in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritation for the narrative. Hate to say that, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's romanticism does more than what Kamal and Jothika do in this movie, plus "Thenali". <br /> <br /> 7. The advantage of Kamal Haasan, Kamal, has this pretentious accent that no one speaks either in India or the US; and it is not new. He did it from "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". It just gets nervous. Imagine what clutter can cause when its flair for using this strange accent encounters filming on a location in the US. He does not even leave him at Immigration, he offers doses of advice to his people (disappointed by TN police in Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in Kamanglish ("Wha we hav here is wok"), of course dizzying. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are several directors that you expect to get to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly, with poor performance in the Department of Goodwill. What D.C.P, in his senses, would fulfill his interest in love on the streets to discuss matters like committing and life after him! The scene inside the theater was so bad, to the climax; I heard the people behind us provoked the hero's IQ out loud. "Is it stupid, can not use the Siren or the Light?" (On a busy road to Madras, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police Jeep follows a guy on a bicycle just like any ordinary guy!). - Can not he use his gun? ("The type on the bike" starts on foot and we have a fully-oriented Kamal in hot search for a considerable period of time). I do not vote in favor of the later, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to look at the women who were raped, their low throats, more women being raped and thrown in bushes with tortuous authenticity, I would have stayed home even more we are just watching a "Police report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive violence should go in a way to expand the story, not to overwhelm it! Somewhere on the Gautum line it seems confused about what are the extensions (rape, murder) and what is the pillar (the story)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double-shot Espresso could not make the headache.
