I lost my first 10 minutes of the movie, but I do not think you see it from the beginning would have made a difference. I found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some other actors (for example, Roy Marsden) in extraordinary roles, but all disappointed here due to a very poor screenplay. "Mines Kind Solomon" ... the very short part of the "mines" movie was as interesting as seeing dry paint and I doubt that even a preschool child would have been enchanted by watching the battle of the warriors. " it was a reminiscence of a cheap US television show. Give me Indiana Jones any day!
