I could not believe it. She had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have a talent, but here they all have been adding to a Cinemax style film ( Alien Intruder) tries to be unique with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / anything else you want to call Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this high-tech virtual reality station aboard a spaceship where four men are allowed to live fantasies, because the system is seen by the captain (Williams). Interesting? Perhaps, but here it all behaves like an episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams pulls everything right and left and shows that he would rather do something else, anywhere else. Ah, the things people do for money ... FX are quite static, maybe less than what you would expect at a cheap price like this. Unfortunately, even female nudity is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, gets ALL the best scenes. If you like a movie that's all quarreling and not brain, check out the "Alien Intruder". Of course, you probably should not look any further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. Not even stars, not even for what power of this movie you can gather. <br /> <br /> Leave it in space.
