I've forgotten this movie so far. This was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. It is a message that seemed to be: "Adolescents do not use their imagination, they can take the games seriously, crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that the inimaginative writers of this piece believed that D & D style games are a form of evil rituals or arcane worship.
