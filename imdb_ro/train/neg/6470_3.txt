Disney goes too far to the well, anybody who has seen the original MERMAID LITTLE will feel broken. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric intend to introduce her to King Triton. The feast collapses rapidly by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who intends to use her as a defense tool to get the king's trident. When the attack stops, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean, while Melody grows up wondering why he can not get in there. Terrible and terrible is what describes this sequel to the movie. LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you the feeling that everything you look like even other Disney movies has appeared. I think Disney can only do it! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walking do not remind you of another Lion King duo! Other disappointing moments include the remake between Sebastien and Louie, the royal chef. They were terrible under the play! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. I will not give anything, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly cramped and too much to handle. Disney embarrassment, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better left to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequel Disney will drown you later.
