Brethren brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) meet twenty-five years later to revenge their parents and take the million dollar tunnel again. Double Impact runs at two hours and practically does not add a realistic approach to the Corsican Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme plot, while the twin brother is just embarrassing as a good twin brother. Also, action sequences are not as interesting this time, and Jean-Claude relies heavily on gunfire, then on his martial arts. Also, the support distribution is wasted and at two hours the movie is simply boring. * From 4 (Bad)
