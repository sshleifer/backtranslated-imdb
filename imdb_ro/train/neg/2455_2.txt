I remember seeing the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents and being pretty good at that moment. Of course, we were seven at the time. Just before going out Jackson movies, my wife and I have rented this movie since you never saw it and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi was left without money in the middle of the animation process for this film and was forced to drastically cut the corners of this production. Since this movie was made primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this says something. Much of this movie is an animation only in the weakest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are very obvious only to people standing in front of a screen with some animated effects superimposed over them. Because of budget constraints, the movie - already a compression of the "Fellowship of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - has been further reduced. What you get is something like a version of the Cliff Notes movie on the books. It's not bad though, but the animation brings a warmth, which I found missing Jackson movies. It's nice to imagine what could be with decent funding. This movie is also worth noting to have the sequel that never came. A few years later, a half-hour-a-half-hour television was broadcast, which was meant to end things. All I'm saying about this is that it was a musical.
