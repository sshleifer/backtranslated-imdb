The summer holiday is Eugene O'Neill's forgotten musical version of Ah Wilderness and, of course, the Broadway musical adaptation at Take Me Along. Except for Stanley Steamer, none of Harry Warren-Ralph Blane's other songs deserve to be remembered, and even one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old playing a teenager Andy Hardy. He was just too old for the 17-year-old, which affected the radical ideas in a spirit of young revolt. Rooney made four films for MGM between 1946 and 1948, he, Killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor, A Crowd Roars, Love laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of this, Rooney played an adult role. Even in Andy Hardy's movie, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Why was it in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. Rooney's bad casting makes Summer Holiday worse because in the original Wilderness, the accent is on the character of the father played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show, Take Me Along, who won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Grand sang the uncle Sid, played here by Frank Morgan and this is the central character. Gloria DeHaven enters Judy Garland, while Rooney's cute and adorable girlfriend, Marilyn Maxwell, plays the show that gives Rooney an adult education. In the original song, O'Neill has it as a prostitute, but it was Hollywood in the Code, so Marilyn is all about to cheer young Rooney. A lot of really talented people have a hand in this one and they do everything they can, but the summer break fades pretty fast in a cold autumn.
