Victor Vargas's picking up does not really succeed in what he's trying to do: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality for this movie. Characters and situations feel completely artificial and false. The reason? Inappropriate targeting. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems Mr. Sollett read somewhere that he does not illuminate his film would give a genuine feeling. Wrong! It just gives him a wrong feeling. Similarly, shaking the camera does not provide a documentary style to your movie, it just gives audiences a headache and lowers what's on the screen instead of increasing it. Of course, what is on the screen is so painfully fake, as if Sollett wrote his screenplay for the sole purpose of showing "hip" to Sundance's friends and showing how much a film producer " edgy ". In general, the only lasting impression this movie leaves you with what is a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about taking some writing and driving classes?
