... when he remodeled Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Reforming Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help in a "dated" scenario in 34 years, 50 years. This sad movie has full-length scenes from the original, many of those who played the roles if they did not die. Although being older does not seem to matter to the director. Neither the fact that the 1934 base plates and clothes did not seem to match the standards of the 1950s. Even the "der Bingel" can not redeem this effort. <br /> <br /> I've rated both the original and the IMDb Four **** Stars remake. Frank's touch has been a long time, and all that remains is CAPRA-CORN. But that did not stop Mr Capra. After he started making some educational films, he gave up his career, turning LADY FOR A DAY (1933) into POCKET OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, a fine distribution was left down on this IMDb Six ****** Star effort compared too the original Eight ******** stars. Sometimes it is better to give up while you were still ahead, right after the UNION (1948).
