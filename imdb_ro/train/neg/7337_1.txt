Painful. Pain is the only word that describes this terrible interpretation of a funny and interesting Shakespeare game. I gave him a shot but I was very disappointed and I could not even finish seeing him. For the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this Mult Ado twist is, I'm sick of you and your bored brain. Let your claims for young spectators be lifted without pay. You do not even bother with this intellectual, disgusting apology for an interpretation of an appreciated Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to vomit and you will need a convenience near the TV you choose to watch this silly because involuntary defecation will occur.
