What terrible movie, TERRIBLE! One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I usually like movies like that, the whole "A guy meets an eccentric woman she likes, but she's already been involved with someone who's not right for him ..." I expected something predictable and I did not mind. Movies are always entertaining by mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not that! Every joke collapses and "romance" makes me want to vomit. The character of the title is one of the most "characters that kills me" characters I've ever seen on TV, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, rather weird and annoying. "Another Person" is the most reasonable person mature in this movie, but it also happens to be just as annoying. These movies are full of soul, there is no way around them, do not waste your time.
