Strong comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, generates a rapid rhythm that carries out processes along the dazzling rhythm through a maze of complications of humor and cold. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong threat of sinister evil. The script contains all the mysterious film projects, sliding panels, hidden passes, thunder and lightning, and poisonous poison arrows. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre enter for obvious heavy melodramatic levers of the gas era. Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment to the people who lived in the 1940s who were trying to forget the horrors of the Second World War.
