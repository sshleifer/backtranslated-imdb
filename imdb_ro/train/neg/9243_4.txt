To simply say, I did not like Westerners. And after I never stayed from start to finish, I decided to look at My Darling Clementine and see her all the way, no matter how painful it was for me. At first he was tormented as expected. I have discovered that it acts ridiculously, the landscape (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring, and the music and its synchronization on the painful edge. However, after I thought I was struggling after the first 20 minutes, it became easy enough for me to stand up. Focusing on cinema, and how John Ford managed to make even the sweetest situations (boring after me) is quite amazing sometimes, it made her more interesting. In conclusion, I can not go that far to say that I liked the movie until the end of it. However, it has been done quite well for me to stay up to the end, which impresses me in its own right.
