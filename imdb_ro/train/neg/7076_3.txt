Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems to be fast until you've driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast until you've driven 250. OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog looks impressively bizarre until you've seen Eraserhead and Eraserhead look astoundingly bizarre until you've seen the Begotten. And Begotten looks astonishingly bizarre until you saw the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Fans Race, there is nothing in the world of film, like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Ghost Alabama comes as close as any of his films to a coherent plot, and only involves hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And Fabulous Woodmobile, sailing to San Francisco's Sunset District, of course. What is really amazing is that someone gave him a lot of money to make the Alabama Spirit. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, many and many effects. Somehow, that's what makes Ghost Alabama SO WRONG. You're going to watch awful gossip like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some of the oddity is excruciating on the fact that they obviously did the movie at the bottom of the Discover books. But the Spirit of Alabama was made with a real budget, and that's bad. I mean, I have a scenario about a cannibal tribe living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the Twizzlers, and no one knocks MY with a checkbook - how did that guy get that? funds for Four of the most delicate movies ever made?
