This film takes what might have been a good idea, a 2000-year-old mummified witch and destroys it completely. Nora and Jim are alcoholics going to Ireland to dry. They go to stay with Nan and her uncle. Uncle discovered a 2000-year old witch kept in peat. He revives and has the shape of Nora. Can not be killed conventionally (more is sin). Nora, however, works in a way to do this. This is a gothic horror film that was made at cheap prices. It's a big mess. I have to ask why someone would want to make a movie so bad. I'm tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. WARNING TO ALL COSTS
