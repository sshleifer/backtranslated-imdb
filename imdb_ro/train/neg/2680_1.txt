Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I'd ever want to see. I also did not like the movie when some Australian people smuggled into Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug trafficking. I would not go to this country, no matter what I saw after this movie. Actually, this movie smells. I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful women alone. Germany is the country I tolerate. I'd rather stay in the United States. After seeing part of the movie in the theater, including the false charge of drug smuggling, we left the theater and repaid the money because I can not tolerate this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who might be a drug dealer, forget this!
