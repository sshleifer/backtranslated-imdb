I read the book of James Hawes. He was pretty tidy, not great but quite fun. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea of ​​what was happening and it was still a stretch of that knowledge. Literally, every element of this film is abisal in ways it does not have the ability to describe. Half-digested fish could have made a better film with hooks and daily lipstick. Never before or as a movie made me feel so upset. The continuation of the mattress was the closest, but they never even reached a depth of terrible indulgence that made this ditch. Since I've lost 90 minutes of my life, look at any James Hawes book without feeling upset. This is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh * t. No, it is unfair. Allow me to apologize for all the fecal matter, because I compared you with the evil of other worlds, which is Rancid Aluminum. Simple and simply a cancer on the cinema world.
