I watched this film on the grounds that Amber Benson rocks and Nick Stahl are generally quite cool - I imagined that any movie with two actors I like and respect could not be bad. And, in this sense, I was right - given the dialogue they have received, both perform quite well. Not good enough to stop the sucking movie, you understand, but pretty good I managed to do it through the 75 minutes of the movie (and this is the main sign of a terrible movie: when, in 40 minutes through "It is hard to know where to start with the problems in" taboo. "The dialogue, as mentioned, is terrible, wooden and totally unnatural, Jan Jones's act is incredibly bad and , since it is the character we spend most of our time around the house, it is an unforgivable defect. The park manages to be so convinced that it does not make sense while it is so clich either completely predictable (literally, none of the major "distortions" in this film would surprise anyone but a small child.) Some interesting photos aside, the director tries too much, with little success, uncomfortable photos Enlargement and camera jitter distract attention from what little story element exists. Three stars in this movie are awarded for containing Amber Benson, and the last one is thrown on the reason that one of the jokes made me say a little. I would never recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
