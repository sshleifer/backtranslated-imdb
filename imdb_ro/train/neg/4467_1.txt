<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides which category fits a movie, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but quite slow. I was particularly disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why the Earth is going to uncle's house (?) He knows exactly what's going on at that moment, plus he has a video tape as evidence. Instead, she runs there and begins to stammer and says, "I know everything, I have proof! You would not expect proof, are you?" Then she is surprised when her uncle rises and begins to walk toward her as if she is going to hurt her. Well, DUH! Of course the idiot will hurt you, you just told him you know everything and have evidence to expose everything. What's going wrong.
