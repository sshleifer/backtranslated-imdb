Unusual? Yeah, an unusual atmosphere for an American war movie, New Zealand. Unusual topics, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers, from one wearing the illegitimate child of a dead son of a senator, another living with seven seamen (one by one) before being killed by her husband in New Zealander, who returns to the POW. An unusual thing to see Paul Newman, his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Someone up there loves me". Unusual for the two star "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves in a movie. /> <br /> Very unusual that I could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film, to give it a wish!
