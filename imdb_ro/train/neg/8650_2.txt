If it was not for an immaculate idiot idiot I know I insisted I was looking at this "documentary" I would not have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scenes and ridiculous moments. One is especially the case when Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for shooting on the streets while allowing the cameraman to continue filming his arrest and then move away, perhaps filming his plush hotel. Then there is the scene where a car collapses in another car that was turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence that it would be in an accident or an explosion. has now received the rating he has (5,8 / 10). I think IMDb users have more meaning.
