Yes, this movie is a real thief. She stole a few brilliant Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero film to boost acceptance (support?) For the wars that the US is still fighting today. I do not want to go into politics here, but keep going, this is clearer than the summer sky. The hacker has nothing special, no real plot. I feel very much in the 50s of Hungary, when the party told people what they liked and what they did not like. The same propaganda films were made at that time, except that they were black and white. Even if we think that this title is a reasonable piece of "The US Wars Are Cool", you certainly have much better movies to choose from.
