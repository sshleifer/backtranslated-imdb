I can not believe I lost my time with this movie. I could not even call a movie. He was so sorry he would not recommend anything. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and strange movies, but that bored me to death. The effects done and the bad ones have destroyed her from being curious. You have to ask what these people think when they spent money to produce this movie. I wonder what I was thinking of seeing it all the way. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did they release that? Was it an audience who likes this movie? It must be because you can find it at almost any video store. But why? It's worth forgetting. If you like bad movies, then this is for you.
