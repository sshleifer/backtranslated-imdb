Whack !!! I got the movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find that it was in two short scenes to the end. Besides, I actually touched the button fast forward. A teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his father and is bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and his friends. Approximately 30 years, but he does not get old and enrolls in high school. There he meets a shy teacher who ends up with the bite and then has children with her. This movie was aspired and I do not recommend anyone. Read war and peace instead. Only Mrs. Hartman did a wonderful job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this!
