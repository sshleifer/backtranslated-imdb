More unprofessional movies about computer programmers. It seems the authors of that film do not know the real thing about the programmers world. <br /> <br /> Top 20 programmers in the world, having their own satellites (for what?), program using satellite frequencies, someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and much more stupid moments to this movie. People who are not programmers will see something terrible about that movie, because they are not professional in this respect. But people will not see real things. The programmers will find that the weird and horrific movie - because a lot of moments inside the movie is not related to real life (why the film is not a scifi in this case?).
