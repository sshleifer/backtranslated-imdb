Jane Russell turned out to be a delightful musical comedy performer, similarly called "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"? but, unfortunately, this movie is wasting these abilities. There is a nice budget and photo in Paris, but the movie does not work. Mrs. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. That does not let anyone play Jane Russell properly. Some of the other players are from WAY in their element. There are several embarrassing scenes; above all, be warned: there is a musical number where blind African cannibals "cook" the cheese in a pot, after Alan Young plays in a gorilla suit. This is an interesting, sometimes embarrassing, loss of resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
