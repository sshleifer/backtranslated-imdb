I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life, very much, but that is undoubtedly the worst ever! I usually love bad movies if I'm somewhat entertaining, but I can not even think of a good thing about this movie. I like Teen Witch for Heaven's name. But S.I.C.K. has a horrible act, porno music blades across the thing, and even sex scenes suck! We should have compared this film's "Twin Dragons", "Master Puppet vs. Demonic Toys," or "Very Brady Sequel." Though, this is far worse than any of these. Please do not waste your time. Believe me, in the two hours you will never come back.
