What can I say? I'm a secret fan of action and horror movies. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and clue, but I'm not a snake fan on a plane. There are three potential draws to this movie: ?? Situation comedy; ?? Horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes being from a plane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not written like a horror in the cheek or comedy, and there is only 1 or 2 points in the movie in which you will smile alone. If you want to get the sense of the movie, the trailer really represents the movie, a horror. Second, if you expect a movie full of actions and shocks, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention. Third, although the novelty of a plane's snakes does not stop, you'll let the cinema think "what was all the noise about." I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not add. A) Many of the reviews in which it was written before the release of the movie and B) Breakdown of ratings of users has much less variation than normal 77% of those who evaluate 10/10, only 7% 10 - Why a such an enormous gap?
