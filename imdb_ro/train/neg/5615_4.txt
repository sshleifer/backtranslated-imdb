I just looked at DVD 1. The program itself can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise, it is the slander of religious people. As if director Brian Flemming recently discovered atheism as well as sarcasm and feels like these tools, he can easily pull off his opposition. Also, Flemming is wandering a lot in his personal film problems. He never returns to the subject. Religious people are prone to reduce skeptics when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in abusive growth. The arguments of such victimized people appear to be irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We should not be told that religious people are impatient, more than American Jews must be told how annoying Christmas music is until mid-December. In the best scene, the Fleming Superintendent of Childhood Christianity faces failure with the director on his motivations. This seems to be the most honest part of the film and was too short. If Fleming was less self-conscious, he might have had a good story about him (past and present) and the abusive institutions who had indoctrinated him in his youth. And maybe he could borrow his "Christ never went to earth" material to a more serious documentary. I do not study Saul / Paul's writings to find out how tight they are, but a brief search on Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discrediting. Bonus interviews are good enough, they do not support Fleming's thesis too much. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and he does not shine on other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good interviews (and easily Google'd) on Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
