OK, I admit that I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I am a big fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically offer a MST3K movie with a 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies they play and some of the worst movies I've seen, I've been able to enjoy the MST3K movies. That being said, this is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. (It's no surprise, in fact, that MST3K writers have commented themselves that this is one of the worst, do not believe me, visit their site.) For me, this movie is a good example of what NO we have to do in movies. Dialogue is very bad, the act is worse, cinema is pathetic direction (while maybe it's the best thing in this movie) is bad. Pacing is the most serious part of this movie. Several times in this film, the spectator had to wait literally for a few minutes for something to happen. While the minutes do not seem like a very long time, they can be in a movie, especially in this movie. I'm sure it was meant to create a state of mind, but I was very bored. It was really felt like ten minutes. If the "suspension of unbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie," then that has enough of it. But SCULLING SKULL is just as horrible, there is no way I really care about what actually happens in the movie and so the "suspension of mistrust" was really nonexistent. One of the most serious, and perhaps the most boring, movie I've ever seen
