Anyone who read my review of Uwe Boll's "Alone In The Dark" will remind you that I compared the unbeatable task of mastering that piece of human waste until every hair on your arm was pulled out. Well, take that analogy a step further with this garbage irretrievably by the gutters and try to imagine the pain of extracting your teeth without the novacaine. Do this and you will have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" means. I never thought a movie was able to overcome the horror of agony that Uwe Boll puts out as "the worst film ever made." But with all honesty, I have to say that Cabin Fever comes very close. This is still a sad excuse for a film that had absolutely no valid reason to meet any form of theater release. For someone who claims he loves the horror genre as much as Eli Roth, he created the most annoying and complicated mosaic of a movie I've ever seen in my entire life. How do you make a story like that? Think of the potential that this plot could have without the badly written characters, without the bad writing and without a useless and unpleasant comedy. A movie that deals with a grotesque meal that eats flesh could have been and should have been a lot better than what Roth has come across here. This script has failed on many levels with me. And while I do not doubt the obvious talent that this director has, I know that he has long crushed the ball on an idea that could have redefined the horror genre. producing missed opportunities would be a rough piece of words. A generous amount of blood and special disturbing effects can not save it, and this is an element that they normally use. There was nothing about Cabin Fever that I could easily recommend to anyone. When three-quarters of the crowd will leave the theater halfway, you know the movie sinks fast. The best advice for those who read this would be to simply rent before you buy. One of the views was more than enough for me to know that I probably never bothered.
