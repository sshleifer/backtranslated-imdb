Dear Richard, I know we all loved you at Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, do you have anything else to do except the continuation of Air Bud's blade? I would have thought Tim could have given you a little role so far, or even become his personal assistant. I know it looks ironic, but the benefits of paying are much more enjoyable. Everybody would see you around Tim and instantly think of Time Tool. You will have more roles with Bob Villa more often. Instead, you will appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and you will smile. I know there was not much scenario, but you could have added. Really, come back. Tim owes you one. But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, fake speakers are more horn than seeing how dogs play sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, you know more than anyone else. It's an "F" movie.
