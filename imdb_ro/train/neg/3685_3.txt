The main reasons for seeing "Red Eye" are starring Rachel McAdams, and Jayma Mays, who is great as Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy is so upset that he becomes cartoon. The rest of the movie is full of plot holes, which I will elaborate. <br /> <br /> Please do not read any further if you do not want to know what's going on! <br /> <br /> Here is a synopsis of the plot. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new, newborn home security director plans to stay that night. Rachel returns to Miami from a funeral, but sends calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone is sitting outside her father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if he calls Cillian Murphy (Jackson). All you have to do is call the hotel and move the Director's suite to one where Jackson's cohorts intend to launch a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. So here are some of the holes of plot or absurd coincidences: 1. Eventually, Jackson convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones on the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to forge that he called, but coincidentally, a guy along Jackson's aisle sounded, too, and started to hit the phone to show he was dead. Jackson catches him and takes Lisa off the phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson and Lisa, of course, are beaten ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa by writing a note on the mirror in the toilet (extraordinarily high) and striking her around her. Miraculously, the only one who hears something is an 11-year-old girl, whose word, of course, is low. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabbed Jackson with a pen in his throat as the plane landed, steals the mobile phone and makes a crazy exit for the exit that fits in the aisle between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers . Despite the knowledge that there is a passenger with a stick stuck in the throat, flight attendants force Lisa to open the door to the jet. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all of this is reasonable (if not very unlikely). But here's where it's really bad. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport and there is no mobile phone signal (every major airport in America has an excellent cell phone reception). She travels through the airport with Jackson in hot pursuit, and no security officer ever delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa to the airport, while the train at the gates pulled at the terminal, lost some of his voice from the neck pen, but he can be still understood. However, he does not bother to call his man outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but the one it showed seemed very dreadful as Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and moves away. Of course, this time, when it comes to making a phone, the phone says "low battery" and soon stops (when will they stop using this whole device?). While the phone still called a "low battery," Lisa came to her assistant in time to save the director and his family of the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the 40th room where the director was moved. Of course, we expect not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides of the ocean, so the rocket could probably be launched at the first apartment, thus denying the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What's the story here? Was the director's first room on the 38th floor, one of the hotel's only rooms, with an unpleasant view? However, everyone gets out before the missiles hit. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa leads to Joe's house to save her father just to see the killer out. Although he drives him (as if he shoots him) by crashing the Jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to realize or get tired of stopping. Jackson gets to Joe's house and knocks him out (we do not see how ... maybe a head). She then explains to Lisa that she has not killed my father yet because she wanted the father to see Lisa die first (Give me a break, what's that, Saturday morning cartoons?). For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson follows Lisa around the house and struggles with resources. Of course, a real killer (that is, one played by Jason Statham) would have disappeared with Lisa (or, in fact, someone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During this pursuit, Jackson passes Joe at least once without disturbing him to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson prevails and is about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) he is shot by Joe. So, here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to hold on to horror. Or maybe you should meet with Michael Bay (who directed such a stupid "Island") and make "Red Island".
