I promised I would never give up on a movie (a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different types of dangers, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians are miserable and pathetic backstage. It shows a world in which love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people humiliate each other for one reason only - to distract attention from their miserable existence. Choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them looked directly from the imagination of Austrian cartoonist Deix), director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is a real life in the Austrian (Western European?) Suburbs. The visitor faces representations of sexual orgy, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not social critique. This is just a clean shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you will have a bad attitude, a bad cinema, a bad shot. If someone needs such a movie to realize that there are wrong things in our society, then this person must have gone through life with closed eyes. This is the pseudo-social critique with a sled hammer. And he looks at people in a disgusting way of condescension. Show ugly people - it's not the reason I hate it. But she describes ordinary people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is truly disparate.
