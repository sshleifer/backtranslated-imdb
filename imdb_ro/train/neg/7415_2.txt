What do you call a horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the movie: I have the feeling that the writers did not really decide what actually happens in the movie! It's a different thing to know, to offer suggestions to the public and not to fully disclose it, but here you have the feeling that scenarios do not know it, the characters in the movie do not know and the audience sees no one knows! (Remember "Cube"? Even this movie knew more about himself.) I've spent a lot of 80 horror / gore films and this movie has deep roots in these movies. But many important things are missing. We do not know anything about the characters. They continue to repeat empty lines again and again. The story does not really develop - it never works. B-drive is fine in this kind of horror movie, but there is not much to play in the scenario. We do not care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even cheerful humor or unnecessary sex. And most important - without emotion, without chills. Get only a few elements commonly used in the horror movie. They show Lord's monsters one by one, but their characters do not really contribute to anything for the story. I honestly believe that this amount of story, evolution of characters and atmosphere could be achieved with a minimal amount of crew and equipment. Yes, filmmakers have done this - and more - 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the movie ended. Too bad.
