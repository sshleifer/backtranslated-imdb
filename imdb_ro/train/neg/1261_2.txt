I'm a Jean Harlow fan, because he has a high quality. I do not think her movies are good and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she was definitely great in comedies. Every piece of comedy from The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is more like a love story. Jean Harlow is great in this and you can forget the rest of the song - their performances bring nothing new. It always makes me feel very impressed that Harlow's body was that of a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks beautiful.
