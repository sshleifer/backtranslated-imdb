Well, EYEboy, I have to say I like not to end when somebody personalizes me and tries to have fun with me, especially when someone is as clever as you. My favorite part of your post was "But there's no big bang-bang good-guy rau-guy here, kimosabe. I suggest you sit at bang bang." Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have a lot of action, as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret and Lies do not fall into that category and it's just a really bad movie. I really do not see many non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and I did not realize how bad the foreign movies were when I saw Secrets and Lines. Perhaps if I judged foreign movies by another standard, I could see how Secrets and Lies could be one of the most appreciated movies on the IMDB. Hmm ... If it's true, it's very scary.
