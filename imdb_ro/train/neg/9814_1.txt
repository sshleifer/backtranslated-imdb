This is the type of movie that you regret to put into the video camera. It's a strange version of Stephen Kings's "Misery (1990)". I can not understand how this movie got a score of 5.2, because it has no story of what ever happened and when the movie is over, I was relieved. This movie should have been released as a short film in exchange ... a lot of time is spent on the same thing. And as in any bad movie, everything happens only at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minute time ... So before you decide to watch this movie, make sure that to put some new batteries on the remote, because you will make many quick changes ... do not worry, you will not lose anything important.
