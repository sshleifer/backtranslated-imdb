** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Topless heroine saves another beautiful babe and her father (an eccentric professor whose cat trolley is broken in one shot and all in the next) a moth-eaten, mummy and miserable Nazis - longer build a fourth Reich. Misty costume, like those of some other wimmen, becomes screaming as the movie rolls on. The last part of the film is dedicated to prolonged lesbian action; this recording becomes really boring, fast, which tells more about the creators behind the camera than the curvy creatures in front of her. Misty takes his nominal plot first and fast, then gives unlimited attention to nudity and soft sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to the films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Think about it: If this wonderful work was done four decades ago, it would have been playing 42nd Street for years with WHAM BAM MORE SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it was, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went directly to the video at home. Take it quickly before you get out of print.
