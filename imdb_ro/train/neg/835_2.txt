Following both the Lion King and the Lion King II, they both liked it. I thought Lion King 1.5 would have deserved to look. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for income. Especially now that they lost the pixar agreement. Basically, they only took a few pieces of pictures that remained on the floor editor (or garbage) and glued them together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both have strong story lines. This movie has a hard story. While characters and animation are always fun to watch, there is simply not enough material for a movie. Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk filling on the original bids. Disney - Shame on you to put this trash to make a buck fast! take the time and effort and do a lasting job.
