Not enough here. There are some funny spots, but not quite enough. I was very disappointed because I love silly movies. I was expecting this to be a hidden jewel. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden cock. All the time, when I looked, I was thinking, "I think I could do better than that and I'm a moron." You do not think a few good reviews. I was stabbed by them. At no time do I laugh aloud. Perhaps this was funny or cutting in 1987, but man fell flat today. This movie promised, just failed. Maybe if they rewrote it a few times. I can not blame the actors. They were not the best, but they did not have much to do with it. This movie has failed because of the thread writing. Pretty disappointed.
