Even though there is a repertoire of over 180 movies to choose from, this "Succubus" is often called the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even the legendary director Fritz Lang counts "Succubus" among his personal preferences. So maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and embarrassing movie. The opening is great, but shows that Janine Reynaud interprets the SM act on the stage. Everything is down, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneuver that eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and spend well on beautiful places, beautiful pictures and a fascinating musical score. This COULD was, indeed, his biggest film, if it was not for the crazy and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term to describe what is presented here. Half the time, you have no idea what's going on or what is being said exactly, so even the 80-minute time seems to last. This is certainly not Franco's best film according to me. I would not even recommend it to the fans of the farm. If you are looking for a superior Jess Franco, try to get your hands on "Las Vampiras", "The awful Dr. Orloff" or "Feminine Vampire".
