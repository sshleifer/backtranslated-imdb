This film is a incarnate fake, a straight line of 11/10 on the phonic scale. The reliability of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just amazing. Here, although true Scotland can be as colorful, if you go there, do not expect to have the chance to "dance" controversy with locals. Also, do not try to influence your local opinion by otherwise tapping art. There are some infectious scenes of singing and dancing, but the plot is too dark and linear and the dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt if anyone would want to remain stuck in a 18th century Scottish village in boondocks rather than in New York City. Perhaps it was not such a sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get rid of that pit. a parade of Christopher Streed in Scotland would show LSD. Besides, I would recommend it just for Hollywood musical completion.
