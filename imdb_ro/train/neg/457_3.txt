Sure, I like short cartoons, but I did not like that. Of course, kids would love it. But again, I am no longer a child (although I still consider myself young). I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is it possible for this cartoon dragon to be nominated for Oscar? Well ... I think it's because people in the 30's were happier than they did now. Now that we live in, everything has to happen quickly. Look at today's films and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow people to be slow. It's a shame. I would like to live in the 1930s because it seems so quiet. But every time I've brought him ups and downs, I think ... To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not scatter your time.
