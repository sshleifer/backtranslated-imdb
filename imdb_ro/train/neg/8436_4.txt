David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequivocal director. His first film "House of Games" was the one I liked best and set a series of feature films whose life perspectives change as they get in complicated situations, as well as the spectator's perspective. So it is "Homicide", which in the title tries to put the viewer's mind at the usual crime scene. The main characters are two policemen, one Jew and one Irish dealing with an area of ​​accused race. The killing of an old Jewish store owner, who proves to be an old veteran of the Israeli independence war, triggers Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. These were the flaws of the film are more obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operated, and the way the detective finally gets to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the movie itself is intelligent as Mamet, but disappointed with a human emotional perspective. Joe Mantegna and William Macy offer powerful performance, but the flaws of the story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
