After I thought it was a two-role master show in Man From Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in sequel? It simply was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as presented by Douglas. Maybe he admitted how poor the plot was - Jim is returning for an extended absence to find Jessica pursued by another man. She could not expect any girl to wait so long without contact with him and not to find competition. For a Disney movie, it contains the wrong language, plus the extremely useless part when Jim & Jessica beat her without being married - very LAME. Pretty insulting to the spectators' intelligence, according to my family members. I'll stay with the first one and try to forget that I've seen the sequel!
