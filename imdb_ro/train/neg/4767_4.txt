I watched this movie as I liked the plot, a group of strangers are kept captive trying to figure out how they are connected. The setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first (and the best) The movie saw, and although there was not much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. There was a comedy deception in the form of the two "Alpha males" and it was a welcome surprise anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart did not give up the action yet. Several things left him down for me personally; 1. The pedophile has been overwhelmed by making it kindled, from children to corpses. The MJH line about her policeman, who should have received it in this situation when, in fact, he was the least deserving of being there, did not contribute to the events that led to their capture. . The End ..... What kind of film ends only in the middle of a happening? There was no resolution, no rock, no obvious purpose ... it just ended. And that's just why I dropped two stars out of my rating. The first 2 points would let him slip but not at the end!
