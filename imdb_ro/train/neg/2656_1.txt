(Very light spoilers, maybe.) Normally, a Diane Keaton fan, I tried to watch tonight. I had to stop it before the second time, because I woke up without any sympathy for my daughter or mother. Both came as self-helpers, with little attention to the others, the daughter also being added to her relative, disrespect and disrespect for the mixture. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was, "At least we will not have to watch it anymore." Keaton did a good job of moving in her stunned and painful condition, but it was too far for me until then. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped. If you care about the protagonist, you have to worry about the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I do not care, it's too late. cast was honest and well played - I felt for them! * - and the best friend of the gays was wonderful, but even combined, it was not enough to take the film for me.
