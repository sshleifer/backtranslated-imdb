OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go see the most, now that multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old "flea pit" cinemas and I'm the healthy side 40 years). In England this movie was released as "Liar," is a dog. It is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for shooting and setting only.
