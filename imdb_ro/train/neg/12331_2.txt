One of those "age-old" movies that should have nostalgia for adults and promise to children. This movie has none. It's a bad excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body move in double with a cute Eric Brown. To make things worse, the movie is either stupid or stupid when trying to be fun, sexy or dramatic. You laugh strangely, because we should think that a teenager would go alone by burying a dead woman in the front yard. Think hard about why a famous woman for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie continued, I began to imagine a private lesson hybrid and millions of Miss Millions, which Sylvia Kristel seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at Ed Begley Jr.'s stupidity or performance or ask what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea about your lesson, stay away from the movies that look at Sylvia Kristel, who are not Emmanuelle.
