I really despised this movie when I saw him at the age of 6 or 7 because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and could do nothing wrong. Until that. This garbage has completely destroyed Robin for a long time. We just recovered with his funny but serious part of his parents' day, but then he continued to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man, I think he was called, but the point is. Robin should have been getting better jobs so far and now he's back to making the noise coming from this "classic".
