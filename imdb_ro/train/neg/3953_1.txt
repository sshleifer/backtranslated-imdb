I can not believe this movie was allowed to be done. These people should be drugs and beaten with strange objects. They should be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing but a movie from the first movie. Everything is original is weird and it makes no sense. It's like a kind of drug hallucination. What about a stripped-up therapy on a mirror. Also, no matter what tomb had patches together, this turd did not even bother to watch the first film, because they called Natalie, the character of Suzanna Love, when she is Lacey. I felt like yelling at the screen, "It's LACEY, it's LACEY !!!!". I give him a -50 out of 10. My God!
