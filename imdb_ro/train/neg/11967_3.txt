Given the risk of having same-sex relationships before the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more experimental phase than life of Cahill. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have thrown in the same-sex relationship between two attractive women to attract the viewers. Consider also the 90 second exposure of crotches of several women jumping back over a high jump pillar. This random scene was very important to the film, and it seemed like this seemed to have been done just to keep the audience interested in this gentle film. I suppose the producers are trying to counter the boring plot and the more boring setting of the movie (Oregon and Field Field Contest in 1980). This review may seem harsh, but it's the truth. The exploitation of the young man's body Muriel Hemingway and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit I would have given to this film. Pepper Thompson
