This movie is easily the worst in the series. Although New Line could just look at sales, everyone knows that the only reason why this made more money than the previous one was due to its 3D end. It was not that the 3-D model was good either because it was 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph). Only people wanted to see what it would look like. Beyond the fact that this movie was so badly done! Wrong scenario, bad characters, evil acting, worse directions. This movie tries to push the camp factor almost to the point of being a "Looney Tunes" episode. Seriously, not for the horror audience, because it's corny and not frightening, and not funny or funny for comedies. Just a total mess, with some really bad guys who are still trying to play this camp and considering they do not fit the one they probably wanted. I remember most of us who were fans of this series just pray that it will end at this moment because of how bad it has come. This is one of the movies that helped destroy popularity and guided that the audience really wanted to laugh with a stupid comedy than to see a horror and good horror movie.
