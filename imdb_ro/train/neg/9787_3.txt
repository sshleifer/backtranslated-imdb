... but the difficulty of this production is that it is far from being a good musical. Granted, we can not always expect wizarding masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; however, the music of this song makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look both. She is dead and uninvited (with one or two exceptions) and as soon as I looked at it, I could not remember a single significant melody - which is quite tragic from someone who has taught hundreds of people in three obedience. <br /> It's also strange non-theatrical. It takes place in an incredibly high scene (you have to be sorry for those people in the front row who broke their throats to see something happening 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and it has absolutely nothing. When there's gotta be one person singing on stage, that's what you get - and the rest of the enormous scene is empty. For me as an aspiring theater director it was almost painful to look. The fact remains, Cole Porter seems to have captured French culture in his works better than these talents can not come close. And I'm puzzled by the popularity of this legendary musical.
