There's nothing that hates more than self-congratulations. Kevin Smith deserves to be locked up by his feet to inspire every middle white whiner to make a movie about why they can not be put. I do not mind the lack of experience and low-budget productions, but when the writing is obvious and cracked, it truly burns my potatoes. The money put into this movie could have reached a true director who has a chance like John Gulager. If you follow the Greenlight project, you will immediately recognize a gifted visionary who is fighting the system. Whoever might take a room and make a word of speech that fails to say anything. When will we be saved by the Smithtons and Whedonets of the world? The revolution can not come soon. Go watch a real effort first by buying Desperado or looking for Friends with benefits. Thanks a good day.
