Something that I really like about the short films of this woman was the elusiveness of the theme - especially in "Living with happiness." This film has some beautiful beginnings - an unusual location and potential for strange cinematic treatment, but they do not succeed with a strange exhibition dialogue, uneven performances and very television coverage. It's once again a charming and very cinematic television. Ideas are so developed that they feel almost like a television commercial. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. I really would like to see this director make a long-lasting animation and try to work with a producer who does not ask for so much boring clarity.
