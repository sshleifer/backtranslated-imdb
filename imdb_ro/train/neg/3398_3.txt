It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (similar to mafia) character of the Russians or at least those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so ineffective that they can not find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects leave the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke a language that has not been identified anywhere, probably spoken by the Aliens in the Urals, but far from the Russian one. So, Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and take care of learning Russian grammar and pronunciation.
