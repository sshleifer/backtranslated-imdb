He watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery / Thriller with too many ridiculous insights. Despite the fact that the film is very talented, this film is too predictable and just under-estimated is the public. The public's film is not bad and I hope there will be no more pockets of stars again and again, despite what they are involved in. We think the movie will be about Connery's conviction of the chapter's punishment at first, but it turns out to be just a standard designed for the public to run in the factory, never to be thriller again. We are trapped in each switch in character, as portrayed when necessary in the story, and we are ready to overcome it before it is over. Yes, there is good action here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-support role, but the story does not work from the beginning to the very end.
