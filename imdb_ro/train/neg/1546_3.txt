I hired this movie for a few laughs. I've never seen the SNL sketch, but with blows like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it could not have been that bad, was it? The answer: it was. This film was barely a means of relaxing after a hard day at work. I just waited for a planet and a funny part, but there was nothing. The highlight was Tiffany amber thieson, and that's just about it.
