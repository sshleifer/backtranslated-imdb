I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought to allow this movie to have the same name as her book. I've always been a great fan of Bridegroom Robber and I was so excited to find out that there was a movie in the factory. I know that the translation of the book into the movie is not perfect, but this movie has been the worst ever. Women's names are correct and some of the back story is correct, but that means. I feel that I have lost much of my time trying to do it through this movie. This should have been a mini-series to tell the story as it was written. The actors for Pink, Tony, Charis, and Zenia were well-chosen, even if I was skeptical at first about Mary-Louis Parker. I just wanted to have a better script to work, because that had nothing to do with the book at all.
