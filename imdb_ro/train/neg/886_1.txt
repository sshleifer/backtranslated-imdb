A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME. That was imperfect but very pleasant (my class was 7), created this piece of garbage for New York City. , I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. In this current film, I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel like I was in my birth town. New York has 5 neighborhoods, I have not seen scenes in The Bronx or Queens, there is a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / There are scenes from the beautiful hotels or theaters. It has a great distribution, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of all kinds. Some humorous moments are sexual or even insulting to many fine New Yorkers that we all know and love. Some of the films nominated for the "Razzie" awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Evaluations: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my thinking I think the title should have been NEW YORK , I hate you.
