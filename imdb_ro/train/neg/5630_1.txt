The only reason I watched the movie until the end was "hope" to see something interesting. The film is very bad, and the girl's performance is really, really bad, honest, I'm not a film critic or an expert, but you need the common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started talking was: "She has an affair with Willem Dafoe and accepted to help her with the script and to appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director" . Surprise, surprise, the day after I watched the movie I found on the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Striking story and terrible performance.
