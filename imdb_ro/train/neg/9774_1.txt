Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and wrote the screenplay for Aronofsky's film about him. This film has succeeded in every level, offering an intimate and impartial portrayal of the characters' horrors and vices that have destroyed them. "The Last Exit to Brooklyn", however, has the vicious and many living characters living sad, but it is hardly the same justice that Aronofsky did. The film sometimes seems ridiculous to anti-gay. Especially when in film homosexuality is equal to death. A homosexual character becomes stoned, is launched to the sky by a speeding car and landing on the sidewalk. Another is crucified and still simply beaten. Another exaggerated value of shock, which might have been convincing if it had done well, are scenarios of union workers who literally struggle with strikers. Who would have thought a drama about the Brooklyners would have action sequences and truck explosions? Director Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director, but he's a lot under cut for real movies. The film is crazy, it does not seem to be a genre. The lake has a useless role that any mannequin could have filled, and Baldwin seems to know how to look bad in his side as weak. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh comes as our leader, a stray prostitute named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). Her performance is not great, and the fate of her character is dirty to say at least. The poor use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is and also takes the "real" edge off the more challenging bits. A failure.
