I have never posted a review yet, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is so bad, I woke up trying to justify how bad it is, trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It is truly without self-consciousness. This is a serious attempt to glory flop. Other commentators have highlighted many film defects, so I try not to repeat them, but I urge you to see this movie. Along the way, I was either speechless, literally panting with mistrust, or floating on the floor in hysteria. I have not had so much fun watching a movie for years. In fact, I'll try to make all my friends see her because it's the kind of film that needs to be shared. My favorite songs: - When Arthur's audition is a go - a boy (his dance is unbelievable) - Free nudity (the leading actor had to get a nude shot) - The office of the preacher with the surrender of Christ of cardboard and pencil - of course, the famous wedding scene with palms and forgotten rings (which narrative has this piece?!) - the fight of the former wife with Ben to get her weapon - the detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; it seems to burn him with this incredibly bad game - Yes, the gay-religious-fanatic brother with his white hair and WeHo clothes - And, my favorite, the use of Joplin "The Entertainer" as a soundtrack and "Canon Pachebel's in D Major "as the soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - YOU SHOULD SEE !!!
