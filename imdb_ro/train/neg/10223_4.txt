I recalled my title so well. For me, it was a movie Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting the roles. And he had Vincent Massey's voice behind the muscles. Flora Robson was great. The next signature for me would be "55 days in Peking". The same role, but with different sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was it all done during the Elizabethans at night? It was sometimes hard and difficult to understand. I could not say the interest of love. Was it his spaniol or was Vivien Leigh? And I do not think Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend sending ships of fire to the army. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This could have been more accurate from a historical point of view, but Bette Davis had more interesting scenarios. And I lost the light of day!
