It's so sad. Even if it was shot with the film, I think it smells a little more than kicks like Blood Lake, There's nothing there and. The music she's playing is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I love my brother and sister in this movie. You both do not try hard to call sarcastically when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what about the killer wearing only the mask at first? This is retarded! Basically, we ignored the second half of this. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect I use when the killer uses the ax. The same sound for every chop!
