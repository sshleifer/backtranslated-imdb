I liked the original. He was brilliant and always will be. Even strangely, I was really expecting to see it happen again. They are usually a bit against re-doing, because there are too many of them, but in a way this has intrigued me. I really enjoyed getting started with this. Bright dog, as usual, and Jude Law, managing to hold, is beside him. It was very clever how it was upgraded and working. What stops this from being very good is in the last seven minutes. She completely departs from the original, so far she stops being intelligent and becomes annoying. The original end was fantastic! So much tension was built and it was incredibly clever! This? It does not grow in tension, but in frustration, because it seems they have decided to make Caine a gay character. If they tried to be different from time to time. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie deserves the watch simply for shows, but those last seven minutes really do. What a shame....
