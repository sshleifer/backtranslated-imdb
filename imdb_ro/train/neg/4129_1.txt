After seeing about half of this, I was ready to give up and stop it, but I endured to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The actor is weak --- much worse than the one who acts in T & A movies in the 80's. There are several humorous attempts that fail to do the wrong thing and the movie is 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, this movie will have a call, but for those who have seen many movies, you will know how the film will be produced after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent agonizing, waiting for the end credits to roll. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
