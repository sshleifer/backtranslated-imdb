This movie was not scheduled in Italian cinemas, I saw it at a fantafestival event. I think it's terrible because some scenes appear to be chaotic and dark music videos, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspicion in the film. Music is completely out of the story and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is exciting, but the development needs a complete review.
