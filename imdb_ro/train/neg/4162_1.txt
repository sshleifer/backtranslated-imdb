If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil, then you should see it instead of making up for 2 hours, you will never come back again. I can not believe that nobody commented that this movie is just a cheap beating of RE. First, the "special" command force is the unique defense for a unit with a computer matrix that has an AI and holographic projection. And this Hive hit has a series of traps that inevitably kill a team member at the same time. There is even a chess reference in the name of the codes, which is in the RE dialogue. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", the nemesis of the film, is a kind of bio-creature, a very buzz of color that suggests necrotic tissue, with lots of cyborg components just like a super mutant of RE. So, a finger of Richard Taylor for claiming any credit for this story. They are not the same obvious film, but the writer took the idea of ​​forgetting Resident Evil I think.
