I fell asleep on my couch at 19:35 last night on Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo, but not last night). He got up at 3:00 (West Bank investment banker) and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked by how poor this movie was. Seriously. shocked. I'm shocked that I have to write a comment about iMDB. This is very bad. writing is boring, but directing and editing are just below those of a freshman at a movie school. Yeah, it's filmed. Remember he's shot on VIDEO, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The videos in the clips on the skateboard have a more "film" feel for them, then this horror. I wanted to describe the poor direction, but I do not remember anything honestly. Photos and jams are bad. Yes, I chose the word "bad". not unconventional, not bold, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say "give me an example". I sing. It was 3:00. but believe me, I know you'll follow him anyway, you'll be drawn with horrible reviews. <br /> <br />
