Through all the accounts, it could have been an interesting movie. Having a score from Cradle Of Filth, with Dani's lead role, which was suggested as "the future of British horror," I expected Alex Chandon's gore to live up to hype. wrong. Everything about this movie is either cliche or inept. The coordination of the anthology was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Of course, the idea of ​​a "sick room" sent me a spine on the spine, but, like most of the film, she was disappointed with the bad writing and action scenario. Chandon can not write a dialogue. Every sentence with the chief investigator of the police is full of oath and insolence (the typical "off-guard" funny, I'm sure I've seen this elsewhere before ...) Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or Scorsese. Sounds stupid. Add OTT fingers, which act very well (do not misunderstand me, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but he is not an actor) and the performance is beyond the laughing crack of the vein. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. The visual effects are entirely poor, with some atrocious CGIs, terrible effects of gore (kindness, Peter Jackson did better now over ten years with less budget) and editing filters that shout OVER-USE! As for the frequent misuse of Cradle Of Filth's score ... man should sue. The fundamental issue with Cradle of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build the atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion among the public. too many successful horror films made in the seventies and eighties make it much better with far greater effects of gorillas (for example, maniac, zombie fowl, beyond, suspiria etc.), making in my mind Cradle of Fear obsolete. I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoge of a movie and can continue to make a horror of quality that actually scares them. More luck next time.
