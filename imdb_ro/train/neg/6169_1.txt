As a great fan of horror films, especially J-horror and also gore I thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it looked like a good, frightening and frightening movie to watch before downloading it. So excited that he had finished and that he was ready to scare himself and take revenge in the horrible gore, I was expecting to be terribly disappointed. The plan was ridiculous, and it made no sense and left too much inexplicability, the gore was hilarious, rather than terrible, and what was the animated sound effect? The act was probably the only scary thing about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus, and the way the mother's husband disappeared into the middle of the sea after a flashing light, left both quite inexplicable or maybe I missed because my mind could not understand what I had seen fact. I appreciate the way it should have been; shocking and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and mother's kisses?) certainly were, I think they just went a little, and not even in a horrible way, they did it without conviction, which made it more credible to be more comedy than horror in my opinion. However, it's a very funny movie and I laughed at myself and some friends, but unfortunately we were expecting horror comedy, so it deserves a watch for the value of entertainment, but do not expect a dark, deep movie scary and frightening; you will be disappointed. If it was a horror comedy, it would probably be a 9th rate, the climax being the strange scene when her husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but unfortunately he gave it to me.
