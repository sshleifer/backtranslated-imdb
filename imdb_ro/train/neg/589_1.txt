Frankly, I went to see the movie not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because it was rated here in Luxembourg and a movie must be really brutal or pornographic to be included in this category. Believe me, being a strange movie, I've seen a lot of brutal movies in my life (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture we've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, the direction is terrible, acting was mediocre even music was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks". There is not a single smart look in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are very difficult to understand. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the child cry - horrible). I do not understand why the film was rated in Germany in 16, where the criteria are really heavy (for example, the murder (brutal, but self-entertainment and allusion to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent direction) even a movie like this the state of grace is evaluated 18). No one can call this horror movie, because it was more to show gore than to scare the audience (showing the face of "Creep" in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) is just a crazy director who lives his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence that has absolutely no connection to the plot and does not explain anything. The plot has holes and defects, the dialogue is boring, and I can not mention a single positive aspect of the film, except for the British and Scottish accents. If I had something to say, I would forbid this movie from theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this stupidity. I look forward to receiving feedback on my thread and I would be happy to discuss one or the other. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, you live" the dream "David Aames
