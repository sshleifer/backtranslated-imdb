my mind blows up how this movie was made. I saw her while I worked at home writing emails and answering the phone - I saw it just because we hoped the part of "revenge" would be good. there is no need to say, the revenge and overthrow of the forced plot do not deserve the emails during which they have been watched. in fact, I'm not even sure what happened at the end. the action was just as bad as the re-adoption scenarios of the FBI Files - by far the worst re-emulation (indeed, only "Arrest and Judgment" can be just as bad at re-adoption) . I did not even know that the man was in "Third Eye Blind" until I saw the movie here on IMDb, but obviously why he never made movies ever since. I hope he's a good singer.
