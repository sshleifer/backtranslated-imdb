"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a garbage. The act is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this trash is that most IMDb users gave it a 10th. This is really scary. No gore, no suspense, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead," Intruder ") is completely wasted, expressed support is also terrible.Yes, some people might like this picture, a mainstream society, but fans of horror or gore-hounds will not enjoy this piece of carp. Personally, I hate horror comedies, I prefer to see awesome movies such as "The Cannibal Holocaust" or "The Last House on the Left". a real horror film should be scary, overly bloody and disturbing, without humor, which usually ruins the whole concept. This is not scary, it's not upsetting, it's not even funny as a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
