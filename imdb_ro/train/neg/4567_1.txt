What poor image of police officers is displayed on television in view of this supposed reality show. We can only hope that the reasonable real suspicion that leads to a probable cause that leads to all the circumstances involved in making a "stop", then "Pat Down" out of the Garment, then being able to articulate why the officer entered someone's pocket and recovered smuggling, was cut off, because if not, the arrest in most places would be thrown away, if even a supervisor passed. A report on a radio mandate does not constitute the actual existence of the mandate, unless the originator has the mandate. If the dispatcher reads from a computer print, it is good enough for arrest, but it does not necessarily mean that the mandate is still in place. Since I have not seen a CBS Disbander (perhaps I missed it), CBS might have problems.
