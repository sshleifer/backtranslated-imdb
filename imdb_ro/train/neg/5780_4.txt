I really liked to like this movie and I watched all the way thinking it was supposed to improve. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst movie, but there's never any potential. The premise is good, the distribution is great (I was pumped especially to witness the return of David Naughton) and, God's love, you can say that everyone tried everything that is best. It simply drains again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to film directors who only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest films and, despite making it easy, you should just forget about trying to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and should be seen more often ... these are the reasons why this becomes 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" of horror, I guess you might want the guy who made "Spinal Tap" to drive her ... just thinking aloud out there.
