If you are not 10 to 14 years of age (except R rating), there are very few things you like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is just as good as she can consider her surroundings but from sins, that's all. A weak plot. Poor activity. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are tough. As the situation is a strange and terrible joke, the significant individual situations are all equally terrible. If we take into account the portions of action, there are some incredible sequences of action in some of the movies that make you giddy and are some that make you angry. This movie contains only the last guy. This leaves a little to the left. I'm very glad I did not pay for it. Despite all the hype, I can read and think, so I stood to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but it was somewhat worried to come in. But, as a wreck of the train, you can not just look away. Even without expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Not even "so bad material is good". They are _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes the "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of trash over CGI'd is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. As this is currently being evaluated, a 7.2 completely erases me. Or in a kind of brainwashing stacking the voting system is all I can think of as answers. <br /> <br /> We could go further and further, but suffice it to say that tonight we witnessed a train crash. I have to wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
