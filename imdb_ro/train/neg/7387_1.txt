The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sync sounds and Segals's voice not really !!!! Pathetic! When audio sync was better in about 5 minutes, plot, lines and poor actors should get another job because the movie is not where it should be. While Segal had some good movies in the early days, the latest ones are a joke and should be a jena to him and the company that did it. If Segal was the one who manipulated this better to go back to having another run show run, because he has no talent so much at this time. This film is a complete embarrassment of all those involved in his production and a shame for all who have seen him. I stopped them in about 20 minutes. I'll ask for the money back to Block Buster!
