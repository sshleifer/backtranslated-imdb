I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. Actually, I know one of the actresses in the movie .. I will not tell who ...! (That's kept under the pads.) But I have to admit it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? Hats to this guy. But it's a shame that he has not been in the movie for a long time. What he misses is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. Maybe it looks like a good movie .. but it was not fun. I'm glad my sister paid 10 pounds to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster. I chose that ... and I was disappointed. Anyway, big finger for me ..! It's not a cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
