It must be one of the most overvalued Spanish films in history. The lack of subtlety and complexity and total political correction make it very childlike, with only good / bad characters. The world is not so, and good movies show complex characters, with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what MINE the most about this movie is the boyfriend's boyfriend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than average-looking daddy (wow, that's like philosophy or something). Thank you, Achero. I'm proposing you for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
