This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulci's best films of any imagination. Crying is bad enough, a millionaire is killed and the spirits call his daughter to find out who did. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides knowing who killed him in 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why someone should care? The father comes as a great bastard to all who he has met (including the daughter he asks him to help), which made it hard for someone to care who killed them. But no one really looks at a spike for a good story, so it would be like watching a porn for incredible scenario writing and acting. Usually, his films try to compensate for this by adding excessive gore scenes, but he is actually missing in this movie. If you are looking for a good Fulci movie, check The Beyond.
