I liked Boyle's performance, but this is the only positive thing I can say. Everything has been overstretched to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke as you would expect from your nine-year-old nephew to talk if he pretends to be a stoneman or an ultra-bad villain. The famous crushed voices seemed amateurish to me. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and be better to open music. And what about the 1984 torture of the police? It was totally useless and had nothing to do with the actual events in the story. Cox has added many things, in fact, that it looks like it's really cool, but it has nothing to do with the story. It is a great disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges's stories so good is his minimalism - they are closely linked, with no unnecessary details. This movie is exactly the opposite. I stopped looking at the scene where Lonnrot asks the guy at Yidische Zaitung or there. I lost $ 4 renting this, but at least I can get some thanks from writing this review and hopefully save others to make the same mistake.
