I'm bothering with Shakespeare's modern adaptations when the director can not figure out whether to use the original or update it. If it uses original words in an updated setting, this is particularly difficult if it is set in the 20th or 21st Century, although it can work well in period styles, for example, the twelfth Night Trevor Nunn established very late in Victorian. It could work with the setting of 30 years if there was much less of the song and dance and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it ends only with a rather banal, but very pleasant show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is so experienced by Shakespeare that, despite all his efforts to be just another student, his power to act all the time. Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student student surrounded by younger students. Instead, I had a pleasant but unimportant actor for the king, so a so-called king, not taxable, without Kingly attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of song and dance, which I found boring despite the nice songs and the pretty dance, unfortunately meant that the great dialogue of Shakespeare had to be drastically reduced. So, it all ends in a banal and lightweight garment, and I was bored very much, including the comic tower, and I was glad when it was over. Branagh did not make Shakespeare right in this production. However, he brought Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan absolutely splendid as the older couple.
