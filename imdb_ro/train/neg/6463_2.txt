I looked at Free Money last night and it was the longest for 90 minutes of my life. With such an interesting distribution, I really thought I was being treated - especially since I'm a Brando fan. WRONG! What a loss of talent. It's almost embarrassing to look at moments (like the cattle scenario) and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous settings (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character returns to Brando's truck?) Ugh. She's trying to become a slapstick comedy, but I did not buy it in it. Jump over that. Just for nice Brando fans. I give him 2 out of 10 because I still think the worst movie ever made was Skidoo.
