And the Oscar for the most underestimated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be said with the same doubt as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. Her Herman character was one of the 2 reasons I can give her to watch this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly annoyed, missing a pleasant but creepy behavior that led you to hope for a more important role of the entire movie. The other reason is M. Eburne's comic relief. Being in the medical profession, I must give kudos the expertise of a hypoconder prone to self-thoughts. Although other "medical mistakes" gave a short chicot, especially when the good doctor sampled the medication of the doctor's colleagues ... "Well, keep on giving it" Unfortunately these two remarkable performances could not keep me awake by 3 attempts to stand on this slow film. Plot is predictable with only a few minor twists. Filming while shooting a legitimate, frightening atmosphere was more productive in making me bend - yes, you can use too much shade. My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when you're awake and a lot of caffeine.
