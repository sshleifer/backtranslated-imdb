My 7-year-old daughter loved her, as Disney had totally figured it would do. That's the problem with "Air Friends". It's a strict children's movie, full of carefully crafted cute, a pair of politically correct morals and humor enough to avoid worrying ratings. As a parent, or even a 10-year-old, you saw it before and you did better before. Think "101 Dalmatians meet at home alone" and you will get the general idea. I think the story of a good kid is a good story, a period. Air Buddies, which is as original as recycled paper, fails to meet this standard. This is not the worst movie your child could watch, but there are better megatons.
