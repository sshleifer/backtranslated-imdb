Given the original version of "The Haunting" is in my top ten films of all time "I approached this adaptation with agitation. I was right to be cautious because this movie is a badly written and badly executed tosh old task it should be ashamed the original was terrible to me as a child for a reason! you see nothing Robert Wise has used innovative workroom and gorgeous lighting to generate fear and that's why it's working is the shame of the new version is that is based on clever and intelligent pyrotechnic effects to get from A to B, but it's sadder that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson or Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different!
