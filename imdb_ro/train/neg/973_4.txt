This typical Bollywood melodramatic film has become inexplicably the favorite of Western critics. Scripture is ridiculous, the act is over the head and looks like cheese. The only reasons for viewing this soap are the wonderful pieces played by Mangeshkar and the appeal of the curtain of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was ill during filming and drunk to death at the age of 40 shortly after the movie was released, has the same fascination as watching a wreck of the train. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but she does not have the power to perform a good job. Bollywood produced much better movies.
