This is a complete review of the first film. A totally useless movie. In principle, she took only every sceanrio from the first film and redefined it in Omen IV, except for a female antichrist this time. It ends in the same way as the first! Music is too busy and interferes, and because it's pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's highly predictable. It's not a terrible movie, it's not terribly done, there are much worse movies out there, it's absolutely no use to be made. The Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, even more useless than that, so I think it does. If someone showed you a gun in your head and you had to choose to follow this sequel or the 2006 line, I think I would choose that.
