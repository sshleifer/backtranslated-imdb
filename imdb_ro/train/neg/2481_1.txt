I have never heard of Larry Fessenden, but judging by this effort to write and lead, he should keep his daily job as a traveling actor. Like many others here, I do not know how to classify this movie, it was not scary or scary, so it can not be called horror, the intrigue was so thin that it can not be a drama, there was no suspense, so it can not be a thriller, it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of Wizard Blair's project. People who liked this film used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read in something that was not there. Just like witch Blair, people were scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought in a fist that it was terrifying. This movie actually started with the family "meet" the locals after it hit a deer. It looked like it was a modern release, but then for the next 45 minutes (much more than half of the film), nothing happened, the pottery family about their holiday home, which was very nice and dandy but not the smallest entertaining. It was obvious that locals were somehow involved in a certain stage, but Essendon has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Eventually, when something happens, it's not clear how the father was shot as he dies (the nurse said his liver was just grazed) and all the time this Wendigo spirit apparently traces down the apparent shooter in a " a very clumsy mode with special effects of grade 3. The film is called Wendigo, but no attempt is made to explain it in a clear way, the film ends and it is very unlucky, I would have saved 15 minutes to go , but I wanted to see if this movie could be redeemed. She did not.
