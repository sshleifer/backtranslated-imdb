It was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrific actress. So, wood makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But, then remember that tower in Four Weddings, just as strange. Another film portraying England as full of box-office boxes of chocolate and village greenery. I mean, school, how many schools other than Hogwarts can they look like? The Twee Police Station resembles the Heartbeat set (a mistaken series of Britons in the 1960s). This movie was unable to remember what it was supposed to be - a comedy or serious examination of the underground in women's friendships. If it had been blocked from the former scenes, the sexual scenes from the cemetery and the extremely stupid mud of the wedding could have worked (just say). But those scenes did not work with the tragedy of the second half. I also find it unlikely that Kate will ever talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. A final note - what is a decent actress, like Staunton, made in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the advertising wrinkle cream.
