I like B films ... but come ... that's not worth a grade ... The end was bad ... b / c NOT REALLY REAL !!! ... not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... do not I mean no storm of illumination or demonic powers? Slowly, hell and then they start killing the characters one by one in a 15 minute period ... and I will not even start from the thing that kills a guy without a head ... then you do not even understand what does Jigsaw do with his so-called "new puzzle" .... If you have nothing better to do ... Id dry paint watch before recommending this movie God forbidden by anyone else ... oh and for make the other movie better, you can see the guy throwing a creature in the basement scene on the window ... which was funny like hell and probably the only good part to see that movie waste
