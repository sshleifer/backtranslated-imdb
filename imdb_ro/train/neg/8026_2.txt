He wonders how this show looks in the air. It was a couple who stayed together, married and having children, but all the others broke up. What is the purpose of continuing this? The show can be fun at first. See all the girls spinning over a man, that almost everyone likes them instantly. It's like real life! Girls start to break apart, crawl to each other and show their true self (or so we think). But the only man is left to decide who to choose that he thinks he can marry and live happily afterwards. What is True Love True? How can you fall down when you have to choose? This show is unbelievable. Did you think online meetings were bad, but people have to go to TV to find love? It's not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he goes out with several others, doing them with them? None of these questions are answered and, finally, when the show ends, you know there will be no happy ending in the future. For everything we know, everything is scripted.
