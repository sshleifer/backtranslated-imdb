The first lesson some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) must know - only "style" is not sold. I think Tashan, when translated, will mean style. Secondly, if you are in love with the style of sale, it does not spare you a decent story. Tashan has a story that might have been enough for a better director. But it's not slick. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this configuration is not used correctly. It could have been a better combination and matching of their narrations. Sequences of actions are from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The chereography of the film is terrible. I think Vaibhavi's Merchant just went through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar gave a good score but does not belong to this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cold song Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he's the crazy Englishman? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotype. You do not mind the lack of this movie.
