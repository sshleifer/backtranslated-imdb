I lost this film in the cinema, but I had an idea in my head that it's worth a look, so when I saw it on the DVD shelves, I thought "I have to see it." A big mistake! A long list of stars can not save this turkey, certainly one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and presented poorly. Perhaps it would make more sense if I read Robbins' novel, but if the film is not completely different from the novel, and if Robbins assists in the script, I doubt the novel should also be a strange story. I hope the actors were well paid because they seemed embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more recently in DVDs to take, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to sometimes look uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Save yourself about 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, such as cutting your legs or sorting the sock drawer. Even when you see it in the trash "under $ 5" at your local store, resist the need!
