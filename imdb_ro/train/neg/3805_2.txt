Err ... this movie was sucked. A lot. I read some of the other reviews. There seems to be a lot of people who think that something written by Woody Allen or the stars in it is automatically good ... I watched more of her films, hopefully in vain that I miss something. But no, just suck. Expensive garbage bin. The characters are very stereotypical (not to say bad enough). The plot is ... I think it should be mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, on any other movie you've seen about him. If you are a fan of Woody Allen, visit this movie. If you are under 50, do not bother. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen AND you're under 50 ... you're atypical, I do not know what to say.)
