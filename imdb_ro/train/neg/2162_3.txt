I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and the film were a story of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier, and Reeves wants him to be Caine. Dog has even had the courage to make Sleuth's remake with Jude Law playing his original role. Jude Law? You mean the one who made Alfie's remake? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during a career of Caine, when it was obvious that he had to pay the debts of gambling. He would do anything for money. He would play in such award-winning movies as this, and "Beyond Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be the praise for this movie is Reeves' death. He deserves better than to remember this terrible movie. So is Caine. This movie can be found in $ 5.97 from Walmart. Together with stones such as "Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
