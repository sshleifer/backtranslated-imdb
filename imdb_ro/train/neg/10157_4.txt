Slashers ..... well if you like the horrors to see it, otherwise you do not mind. It is obvious that this movie has a very low budget, for example, it seems that the whole movie has shot a deposit somewhere, and on many occasions you will see the shadow of the boom and the shadow hand room, believe me to look for them. Also try to ignore the brown actors, if that's what you call them! it's a little people decide to go into a game show where they have to survive a night in a big labyrinth because of their being 3 bully killers and anyone living at the end gets rich. Now there is something about this movie that tracks you and rarely find it with an inexpensive horror budget these days, for example, when I looked that I thought of myself, I would not think to go to this game ! especially for $ 12,000,000. so anyway I would recommend you to follow it and create your mind.
