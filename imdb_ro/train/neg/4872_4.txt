The collection of fart joke production lines that claim that "Babe" has never been made; writers clearly hoped that the trick of seeing animals talking would be enough to keep the movie going. Is not. Eddie Murphy is selling again as a doctor, rediscovering the gift of forgotten childhood to understand the unremitting and unhurried guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The show is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the script is so unimaginable, chaotic and depressing, bin gutter pretty fast.
