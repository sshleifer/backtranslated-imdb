This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex-loving girl was probably dead, but his dad just put a spell on him to turn him into a really nice shark. Something similar in beauty and beast. Perhaps she could use a dance scene in the ballroom and maybe a candlestick, but instead there are some pretty rough plants. I really make this girl feel itchy, so she gets eaten by the shark type instead of scratching the whole movie. The scientist is a good father trying to reunite his fish-shark son with the woman he was engaged with, even arranging them to have private time for sex, but the woman in this is a really superficial snob and thinks shark - The guy is a nasty, ugly monster and he does not want anything to do with him. She gave up love! Just because he was a shark! I thought he was sad enough that all he had to do was kiss him back to normal and live happily afterwards, but it's not like a movie.
