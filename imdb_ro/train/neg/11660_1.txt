Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has no real knowledge on how to make movies. he made a great movie and that's a scary movie. movie 2 was fine, but all that Keenan did was real disasters. avoid such titles that you are not a threat to the south while drinking juice in the hood ..... I know, what title! obviously this movie, all that has the name Keenans in credits. It was an hour and a half on the stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me, maybe women could enjoy this movie a little because of things that happen, but on the whole this movie will never be liked by someone with a good taste in movies ...... .. 1/10 ....... jd Seaton
