I rented this movie, thinking it looks like a wonderful historical piece. What I received was a piece of pure garbage. This movie was confused in most places, being tangled in almost every place and terrible in all places. The presentation of Mira Sorvino to a queen who played a young male scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knight, even though he considered this film one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely remain to play Petunia Dursley; at least Harry Potter movies are much more fun than what they call a piece in a movie. Cinematography shows that a college kid took a class in Cinema 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the movie is cut for a certain effect; the end result being, of course, the cheapest way of editing we've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; too bad had such a bad scenario in which to work. Rachael Stirling makes his best effort as the almost ugly waiting queen. Eventually, I really want Blockbuster Video to have reimbursed. I'm glad I did not spend $ 10 looking at this fiasco in the theater. If they have done this Marivaux game since the eighteenth century, it makes me wonder how many people throughout the times have had the best nights during this work. If I were there, he would not have heard the song over snoring. We appreciate the goodwill for the modern comfort of DVD players; you can go through boring or terrible scenes. I think this means I just looked at the beginning and the end!
