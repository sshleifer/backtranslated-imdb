This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the story is shit! There's a funny joke, it's bad and it's boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. No one acts humanly and everyone acts stupidly and ridiculously. Rob Schneider acting as an animal is not something I would pay to see. It seemed funny to me, but the bottom line: DO NOT WANT TO BUY PRECIOUS TIME ON ONE HIDDEN AND MULTI MOVIE. I wondered when it ended, even if it is a short film. At first I thought it would be better; but it's getting worse. Stupid, to the end. I went out of the theater and remembered the film as being extremely bad forever. The writer and co-producer of this film is a Simpsons television writer, but this is nothing like The Simpsons movie sucks !!!)
