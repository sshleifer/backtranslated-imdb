Why should we look at this? There is one reason and that is for the greatness of John Saxon. I like to act. My most favorite appearances are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as Nancy's father a policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman and Din Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. When I rushed through my mall at the local mall I met the movie Zombie Death House and I quickly threw it back, but before going any further I noticed that John Saxon was not just a film actor , but for the first time I heard of a director. This has intrigued me (also the cheap price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to have it. On my return home I realized that this film did not live up to other works of Saxon, even in acting, which could have been mixed by the director's added pressure. But not only the other actors have been subjected. They seemed like they were all out of a recent porn movie and they said now that you have to act. The film even shows 80-year-old porn quality. I can not recommend this movie to occasional viewers, but if you are an obsessed fan of the 80s who missed the culture that came from that time by birth until late or a fan of crazy movies than this is for. And if you dug John Saxon as I do.
