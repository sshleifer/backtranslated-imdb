Apparently, this is a ZTV horror movie of the Z type. But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, often <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Why read that book?" "Because it makes the intrigue more exciting" and <br /> <br /> "You made the road here, now you can make your way again!" (after he leads a man in the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what he sings) <br /> <br /> - it's not so clear what this movie made in the known era for post-structuralism, is actually about, or if its bad movie filming. The action is atrocious, but some actors I know, so do they? An old house, obviously cut with contemporary dwelling, is the scene of the crime. A (bad) movie is in the field and the story comes back.
