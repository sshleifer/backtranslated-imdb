Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparent "essential bio-cinematography," however they are here to tell you that the film does not deserve great praise. First of all, let's get right, Prince is an excellent musician, and Music is the area where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is fascinating, and if this movie was just shot as a concert film, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not and as such the film has some problems. First of all, in writing, Prince's character "The Kid" is supposed to break out like a mysterious loner kind of a few words, unfortunately, this is just lost as stains and incense. A very good character should have at least a few moments of speech, unfortunately, Prince's character does not have much dialogue words in the movie, and it's hard to believe he will make the girl that way. Everything seems a little over here, which is a shame because you can say that this is a very conflicting person and lives a very complicated life, but we are never allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this film is how much it's going on in the concert. Prince and Morris's life seems to be a place behind the shows here, which I think makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2-hour film in which seemingly half is happening on the stage, especially when story of the characters pushed aside for that. <br /> <br /> So to summarize: This is not a very good movie.
