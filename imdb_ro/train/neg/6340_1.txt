This is the kind of movie I'm most afraid of. Arrogant and irresponsible, she presents a sketch of the Colombian conflict, so clear and stupid that it is an insult to all the people of Colombia. The performances are godaw, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who even looks from a nightmare Tim Burton), to Díaz, who makes a notable effort to bring the life of a dimensional character , so written and so badly written all he has to do with him is a mustache. Not to mention the free end, a gore fest so stunning that it would make Ed Wood overturn. She fails in all respects, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing and, above all, directed, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a bad director, but at least his previous films have had a certain dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Columbia filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsibility from this fiasco intended.
