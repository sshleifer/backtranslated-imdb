Tony Scott leads a sport thriller film that should also attract non-sports fans. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too slow. Well fine! Outside, he seems to be a dissatisfied salesman (Robert De Niro), while inside is a psychotic fan of the San Francisco Giants. Together comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and the designated savior from the depressed. Our vendor has a killer obsession when the heavy blow of all the stars falls into the worst fall of his career and the Giants are afraid to collapse with him. De Niro is personified by terror. The snipes look very natural for the ball player. Other notable casts are: still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... enjoy yourself. Violence and very strong language are expected and you will get money in value.
