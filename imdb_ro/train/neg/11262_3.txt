Adrian has just left the asylum, being rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy his mother prostitutes. Desperate for earning some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian look for his life and who his parents are. This is a movie of a new director and is perfectly clear in most of the movie: unwanted scenes, little forced dialogues, some incoherences in the script ... However, the end is unexpectedly well done (well, just a bit) and which saves the film a little. The actors are also known and of great quality, however, they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; all have done more work in other films. The results of the movie are boring and you'll probably spend more time thinking about how much time it will take to finish. Of course, there are a lot of bad movies, but, of course, there are many much better.
