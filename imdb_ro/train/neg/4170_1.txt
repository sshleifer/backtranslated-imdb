This is just flat out. If there's a story here somewhere, it's so deeply buried under horrible characters and camera work, which is indescribable. There is a group of vampire hunters moving around them and the vampires they kill inside have some aliens. He opens his heads and speaks like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine blood and a foreign-coated stocking doll screaming horribly like a cowboy guy, it's a bovine, that's what you get here. These people are strong, mistaken, violent and extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human people who are around them in their CGI space being so incredibly pompous that it is impossible to take. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist in comparison. They're friends with some vampires or something ... who cares. Then he works on the camera. Remember how everybody hates the one-thousand-piece junk-one minute from the recent Rolleball remake? People who made this movie LOVE these stuff. It's enough here for three great clips on MTV. Nuff said. This smells. In comparison, the Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
