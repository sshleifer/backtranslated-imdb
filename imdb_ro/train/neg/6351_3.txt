Possible spoilers. Although there was good action - especially Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the midst of the comedy - it was simply not an attractive movie. Seagulls between comedy and tragedy were strange or sometimes not obvious. This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the support distribution differs in the two halves; I figured out how things were presented in the opening scene that the people around Melinda were the same people, reacting differently (more of a premise "El Said, She Said"). However, what we have is two completely different stories and two completely different women, both of them met by Radha Mitchell. The two playwrights in the opening stage - the comedian and the tragedy - are supposed to take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are just related. They do not do much to support the subject of the discussion, that almost everything can be seen either as comedy or tragedy. Beautiful, but a disappointing film.
