Even if you could get over the idea that these boring characters were personally witnessing every significant moment in the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson family and no one died at Altamont), this movie was still incredibly terrible . I have the impression that the "writers" just got locked in a room and looked at Forrest Gump, "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60-year-old movies and called them research. A Canadian television critic called for the end of the first episode of "spinning head". He was right.
