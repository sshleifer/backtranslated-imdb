R O B J O X <br /> <br /> Burn master. <br /> <br /> Grotesque horrible. <br /> <br /> It does not end; no closure. Completely and totally the worst movie ever made. Replaces Pluto's "Adventures of the Nash" as the worst film of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this unspoiled, undirected, unclassified, undirect, unproduced clutter of a thing called Robot Jox - and I just found out - IT HAS BEEN A SECOND! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) because I hate their films. This misery of one thing makes these movies bad - not horribly horrible and grotesque like this. This is the only movie I have said - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW! 10,000 out of 10 people considered this comment helpful.
