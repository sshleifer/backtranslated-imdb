I think the reason why this movie did so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first Beverly Hills Cop movie at the time he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and was R and it made about 80 million and was pg says it was not so popular. I've never been Eddie Murphy's great fan, so I'm probably not interested too much. It has Eddie as a discoverer of lost children. He has to find the golden child or the world is in terrible distress. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it does not compare to the special effects. I've seen better things done in the 1970s than some of the things he's been offering, Ray Harryhausen did better things. However, the main reason you see such a movie is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny about it, and it seems stupid to put him in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scene. I think they hoped to have a fish effect, but it did not work for me.
