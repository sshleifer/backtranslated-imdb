The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - member of the Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and about his adventure with the character of Amelia Earhart, played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met with strange but fascinating Hepburn, he "could not help" and fell in love. You can say, because they look a lot in space and talk ENDLESS about how painful their unconditional love is. Frankly, this is a terrible film to date and virtually impossible to track. Part of the problem is that in pre-code days, movies admiring adultery were very common. In addition, even if you accept this moral suspect, the total sappiness of the dialogue makes it look like a romantic nineteenth-century novel ... and one very bad about it. Sticky and hard-to-see characters (after all, Clive's wife is a nice lady and no one has done any harm) make it a great waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume that Hepburn is wearing in an early stage dressed in a moth suit! You have to see him believe - and he looks like one of the Bugaloos (an obscure but appropriate reference).
