Some of my old friends have suggested me to watch this movie, but I only have a chance soon. I had great hopes to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, which I saw was a bunch of angles of the high-speed trash. I could not understand what the message was except for degrading Hinduism. I'm more like many types of religion, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a low character to orchestrate such a thought. He could have done a horror movie than that crap. He tried to add the genre of Hollywood viruses, and God forbid he did not turn this guy into a mutant and eventually go to world domination. This is a very suitable movie for a movie school against a regular audience. Shame on him because he does not rise to the talent he has. Starting from the story, Chaos tried to borrow ideas from the Butterfly effect, then between the low religious harmony at the cost of the insularity of Hinduism (once again insulting Hinduism more, but this film has no equal, and my insult is the same for religion in general, this intellectual film.)
