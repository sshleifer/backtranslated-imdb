At first glance, this film has everything a psychopath wants: a vampire story with a "not under 18" restriction, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbians), some fanatical zealots, and even a murder cop! But then, this movie is a success story of a bad story (so thin), a bad action - with an incredible English accent that makes you think you're watching a bad Monty Python - bad music (hard rock of the ' 80), filming is terrible, the end is a real shame ... Plus sex scenes are ridiculous, not very impressive gore. And those vampires are reflected in a mirror and you do not even fear the light of day! You will become very disappointed if you do not see it as a "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day go down to the bottom 100, because this is his real place. I'd say it might be fun to watch if you have friends and a lot of beer. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
