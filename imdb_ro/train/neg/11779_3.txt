I do not really like this movie. If you've read Puzo's books or at least you've been watching very closely the first two movies (especially the first), you'll agree with me. Compared to Corleone's saga presented by Puzo's novel, the screenplay of this film is sometimes ridiculous. Characters and relationships between them are distorted. The story gets to nowhere, though it seems to go in a certain direction during the movie. It is understandable that different moments should be expected for Corleone's saga in the 1990s and that we will not find things as they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from other films in contexts when they did not fit. Why this? It seems like those badly accomplished successes that just try to copy the original qualities of the film. What will never be understood is that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino have joined to do so. A man who directed the songs as Revelation Now and the Godfather must be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinematography until he dies. So is Al Pacino, because he is the actor. But Mario Puzo should not have written this. How come? He has destroyed all his previous works. What a shame, buddy. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is the story of a 90-year-old mob and it's great. We can never say the same thing about the plot of God III.
