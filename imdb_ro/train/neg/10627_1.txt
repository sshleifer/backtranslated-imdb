I notice that most people who think this movie speaks to the truth have never been born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it's much easier to ask a historical event if you did not live through it. I was a young man in the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. The newspaper headlines screamed the last few days every day, from launch to landing, from rescue to moon to moon, to the street, in a multitude of languages. In school, some classes have been canceled so they can watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13, the world prayed and held his collective breath, while the men saw him at home in an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere without someone asking you what's newer. The world was really a community. <br /> <br /> Now with a 30-year buffer after the fact, it's easy to claim fraud, because world enthusiasm and interest have fallen. We remain with our history books and anyone can claim that history is wrong and try to "prove" it with a bunch of lies and deeds drawn, completely ignoring the preponderance of the evidence that looks different - not to mention the proof that it lives in the souls and the memories of those who have lived through these wonderful days full of wonder and fantastic.
