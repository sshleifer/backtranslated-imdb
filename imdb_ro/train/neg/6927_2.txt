Although we rated this movie a 2 because it showed a total lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film was an amusing 10 unintentional scale. I did not realize what was happening in the movie or who were the people, but I did not care because I knew every scene would have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie, but I think this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no line of plot makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie from the beginning to the end or if you watch it back, you will be confused with joy. I especially like the scene in which prisoners twist around battering each other with sticks. I think the doctor refers to this as a treatment. Genius!
