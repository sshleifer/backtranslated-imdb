Normally, I have no problem with a movie or a story with an end that lets you wonder what really happened when done for purpose ... But this movie really feels like have the last 15 minutes they did, then they realized they had $ 5 at the end to finish on ... I saw TBS ... We recommend you not spend any money on it. If you catch on television, watch all but the last 15 minutes, then go away and create your own finality in your mind. Indeed, the film would have been better if it had simply disappeared, and would go back to the Poice of the federal state just to find that the city and the cemetery of the car had disappeared, and they were never there. .. "Wish I had more fingers, so I could give that movie 4 fingers!"
