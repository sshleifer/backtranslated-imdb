Despite some pretty bad reviews, should I have to give this film a way? she has, after all, star HK super babe Shu Qi plus 6 other Oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cats-thieves. Is it definitely worth checking out? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye candy is of the best quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as usual, and the other girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, caught my eye in private. Unfortunately, if anyone is to judge this movie through any other possible merits, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the unpleasant action and the special effects are even pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing have provided us with a photogenic distribution and something else. If Shu Qi is the only reason you want to see it, it would be better to watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
