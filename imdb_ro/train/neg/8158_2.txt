What is the point of creating continuations that have absolutely no relevance to the original movie? No point. That's why Prom Night is so embarrassing bad. The original film involved a group of children hiding a dark secret that ultimately killed them all in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone explain to me what a dead queen has said to me that rises from the grave to steel, and the crown has to do with the first film then? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that let the audience always wonder how this happened and why should this happen? But, finally, I think you could name one of those movies that is so bad that you'll get to laugh through it.
