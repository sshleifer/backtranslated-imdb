There was no movie Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie. He was a great wannabee. He wanted to be a hoarse, nervous, laughing movie in urban life, but it's more like a movie, weird. It's much easier to imitate anything than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I could not care less about the characters or what they were involved with. They always always hit, sang or complained about each other. There was no substance in what they were doing. The dialog between the characters is meant to be hip, revealing, instead it is expensive and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are spectators there who really like this movie, so I'm wrong.
