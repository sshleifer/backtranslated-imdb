For terrible fans Judy Garland only. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one in which she makes a number with an older lady cleaning (you've seen all the pictures), and a pretty good number at the end. There are some scenes where the lines are funny. But, basically, the script is so bad, and the movie is dated so it's hard not to get away with horror all the time. But it's worth 2.50 to rent the movie - be prepared to do it fast.
