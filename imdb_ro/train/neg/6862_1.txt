This superior inferiority to the original "Blind Dead" is another waste litter. So many people have suggested these movies that they can not believe what they say about it. Since I was a child, I've heard about how terrifying and wonderful these movies are and I've seen them all, and it's been very disappointed, it's been a drug world in the '70s, or I do not know how boring it is ?
