This movie will be a hit with those who enjoy sophomoronic, mindless, praiseful expression of sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good plot? Like comedy? Such as romance or other human values? Stay away from Whipped. It was so bad I left after about half an hour. I saw two children slipped in this aspect, which looked like 10 - very damaging - this deserves an X.
