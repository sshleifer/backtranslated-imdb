Since I am from Hungary, I have heard many people saying better and better things about Üvegtigris so far, but I do not really understand the reason for that agitation. I liked many of the film's points, some of the quotes really horrified me, but the stereotypical characters are back again, as in any Hungarian film, and the story is also pretty dull. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole movie worn. Rudolf Péter is good as usual, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are just there ... doing nothing. How many years have to go for a good film in Hungary ???
