In Lit. the class we just finished, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did not know the pilot's name. (3) His mother deceived his father in a station wagon, not in the forest, where one could see. (4) The man his mother deceives has no black hair, has a blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen-year-old can not put his fist through a window in a single shot. <br /> <br /> And for acting, the kid who played Brian was a horrific actor. <br /> <br /> However, I think the landscape was impressive, although I doubt the director even read the book. This movie is good if you have not read Hatchet's book by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then a letter of complaint begins to the director.
