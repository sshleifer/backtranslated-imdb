Give me five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix, which offers a very decent set of the latter material. Unfortunately, the quality of camera work and editing is approaching awful! We have countless full-length photos of Hendrix, where they could do almost anything, maybe make a pee? We do not see his hands on this guitar! Also, we were given enough Hendrix photos from behind? It looks like there are three rooms on Hendrix, but the amateur fools are operating them all. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be eager to stray his attention to the scene, as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is happier at zero in a few chickens in stalls than really documenting the incredible guitar work that bleeds the amp (sound recording is good due to Wally Heider). Interleaved tracks are clips of student wickets who protest against Vietnam, etc. on tracks like Machine Gun, complete film waste! If Hendrix lived for another two years, Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day until an official release goes. The only jewelery it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a rather poor visual document of the big and inferior both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
