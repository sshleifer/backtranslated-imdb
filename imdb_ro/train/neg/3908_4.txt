There are enough powers of the stars in the SPIRIT HOUSE to create another galaxy, but the final product is quite controversial. The film and its messages are very noble and I think they would most agree with them. (Liberal Democracy, violent fascist regime, evil, open spirit, evil racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are beaten from head to foot with these, and as much subtlety is used as we have described. Lastly, we left watching very noble people, without any defects, with some nasty cretins who do not have redeeming qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a fights battle pro "orchestrated" badly. Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his talented bride and Glenn Close as her right sister. When the room stays with these people, the movie tends to move and is quite pleasing. Unfortunately, HOUSE OF SPIRITS simply engages with too many subplots, and the characters open up and out of the picture as the shooting gallery goals. We do not know them, so we do not care about them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) either prolonged the movie or cut some characters, this movie could have worked completely. As it was, it was a beautiful test, with beautiful messages and a stuttering.
