Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have stayed alone alone when he made "Criminally Insane" 10 years before releasing this painful loss of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminal Insane" had a duration of less than an hour should have determined that he probably ate this story for everything he was going to get out of ... but instead he chose to use TONS the original images in this even also to the point of initially recycling the opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, the bringing back of rapid aging, Priscilla Alden, did not save it. What little original movie was in this movie looks like it would be filmed with a rented room! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and would be as surprised if she did something close to that amount! Avoid this and watch the original instead!
