I liked the first movie, but this is an example of a sequel maneuver that would have been better to stay on the board. The general idea of ​​the first film was, if not great, then at least very interesting. This sequel tries to rely on the idea and characters of the first film and, although Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these movies, then you get the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take all the joy from the original.
