Tromaville High has become an amoral wilderness dirt due to the negative effects of the accidental release of toxic waste by the nearby nuclear power station. The unrestricted chaos is rooted in absurd violence and gross behavior. Rather horrible, obviously intended to be a misery in a movie, with filmmakers who release their free time, allowing him to be free to embellish him. The craft was far from Troma's list of targets for this seagull. Honor society is punks with dazzling jobs and strange outfits. The German professor, who becomes a member through a "toxic kiss", has stripes along a face that gave me true movements. The toxic monster that sent the ANNOYING points to the end is pretty cool. br /> <br /> The type of film baskets will embrace all the heart.
