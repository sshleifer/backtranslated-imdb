Carly Pope plays JJ, a recently promoted food critic, whose flamboyant and arrogant mother moves with her. JJ, fiery at this meeting, blackmails restaurant owner Alex, to have fun with his mother in exchange for "perhaps" reviewing his dying restaurant. Alex collapses predictably for the daughter while warming up to Mom. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universal 2-dimensional. JJ is an ugly, ugly, superficial and superficial mother. JJ's colleagues from the magazine are angry and opportunistic. The message underlying a woman over 50, unable to do it alone, without male assistance, is bad, bad. The action is uniform, the scenario is not inspired. Movies that save only grace are the settings in New York City. I would not recommend this movie.
