The wife of a London scene producer hopes to fix the American song and dance man who played in her latest husband's show, with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her life fashionable in the circles of society. Unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, the little girl suggesting that the producer is actually the married manufacturer with her girlfriend (the fact that she does not wear a wedding ring would discourage any misunderstanding!). Musical music Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers is finally dragged back to earth by the idiot scenario of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers do not meet just cute - they meet ridiculous (dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above her and crying). The audience of 1935 probably did not care how the two would meet - as long as they did so with joy. Today, the central characters seem to have no motivation to get into the other's arms: they are floating with flowers (after telling his friend that he wants to remain "freely fanciful" in the love department) and gives him the brush. Nothing that a little dance can not cure! This glamorous twosome is as unrealistic as the London and Venice settings, but we simply forget because they are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for those who do not ... do not talk about the plot. Musical moments destroy the monotony of the scenario, but they can not overcome the surrounding sanctity. ** from ****
