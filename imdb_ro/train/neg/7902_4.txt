Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlins clone coming out of the '80s. I'm not a fan of imitations. First was the excellent "Gremlins". Then came very "Critteri". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, 'Munchies' for me should fall somewhere between 'Ghoulies' and 'Hobgoblins'. In fact, we probably found it more fun than "Ghoulies," but I preferred the darker tone. <br /> <br /> In spring, her naked nature is playing (which is best for her), but due to the nature of Hammy's work (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), you can get more attitude towards the fact that you prefer to see only munchii running amok. Here's the fun. However, the story focuses mainly on ammunition (which is either hungry, excited and destructive) in a bunch of comic encounters supposedly (at times not working) in the desert town because a couple of people are on track. It's stupid, but weird, thanks to zip stimulation. The creatures themselves look pretty mellow and badly detailed because they are the basic puppies being chucked about. If their personalities came, it's that they can actually talk ... and attitude. Charlie Stratton and a fetish Nadine Van der Velde (who was in "Critters") were equitable leaders. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. Funny low fun entertainment for undemanding.
