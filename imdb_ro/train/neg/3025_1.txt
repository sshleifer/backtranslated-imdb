this movie is really bad ....... I do not mean very bad. Tony Scott is a terrific director. of all the movies he has made, I'm just the enemy of the state, besides being one of the weakest directors of all time. What I was most concerned about was Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko's director) made the script to that effect. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but to be involved in that makes the hope that he has learned his lesson. Now I love Mickey Rourke's new roles, but I'm just like him in that because of the terrible story and look. do not misunderstand me I still like Mickey Rourke, but he did some accidents in his time and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Keira Knight, I think she's a little overestimated. I just can not feel for her in the movies. all in this movie is bad. this is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
