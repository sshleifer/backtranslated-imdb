I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I did not do this before I look at the TLB and I have to say that I was very surprised to see the rating above at IMDb. I find he has a total lack of story. You just got into it (and, unfortunately, not the way Saving Private Ryan escaped in the movie) and also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory for me. to admit that the wounded soldiers seem pretty real to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But get ready to laugh ... Some guys are thrown into the air after an explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew or a somersault during the First World War is a little too much for me, especially when it is done countless times during the movie ... But the songs that really laughed until I almost cried were scenes that they had a close fight. The German voices screaming and shouting ... incredibly funny. It sounds like a single singer / vocal actor, because they all sound the same and just sound like a "typical" German voice. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except those who just want to have some laughs because of its sad and horned quality.
