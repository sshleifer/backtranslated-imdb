If you are not a movie student who needs to see everything, this movie will not only be a waste of time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond faith. to be a story worth somewhere inside, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it under so many chaotic layers of uninterrupted random audio video microcasters, making the spectator's patience to be slim after a very short period of time. it would be someone like Hopkins to choose such a difficult project, the most difficult and extremely unstable because his first script, the first score and the third film can guess anyone. Perhaps he has played with him in his mind for so long until he has become unrecognizable as what he has become, not even for himself. The result proves that he does not have enough experience or ability to achieve the desired result. Even the weirdest films Carpenter and Lynch, to name just two kinetic films, had a 90% coherence, 95% fewer characters, and a story stream of 99% more. Sir Anthony steered towards the stars, but unfortunately lost a few years of light. Stay in acting, in that department you are an unrivaled giant and no one should ask more than you, not even you!
