I'm not sure how they are related to them, but I'm pretty sure Lost and Delirious are a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). Very similar, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see one in return. This is moving very slowly, but being a French film of the 60s, which is expected from the style. She said in retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revising school. Editing flashbacks with current scenes is rather confusing at first, especially the sound of each overlap (for example, retrospective hearing while seeing the present and vice versa). Also, the "girls" are a little old to think I'm in a boarding school. Finally, the development of characters not too much to get you attached to the movie.
