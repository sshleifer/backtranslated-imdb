The problem I find with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a movie. A mixture of the two genres does not work and leaves everything hanging in the middle of nowhere. This is more so as the director has chosen the most extreme of what is supposed to happen around our everyday life, making him an unconvincing document. If it's meant to be a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the morale or message the director is trying to convey to the public? That there are people around us who are evil-treating others who are willing to be mistreated? That there are many crazy fools around us? So what?
