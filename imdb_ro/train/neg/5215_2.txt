It's the same old: "If I can not get the funding for my project, I'll inject myself," a monster movie. There is nothing new here. It's a bit like Jeff Goldblum's "Fly" movie. Man manages to preserve a certain appearance of health, but ultimately yields to the effects of his experiments. The actor is pretty bad. There are people who act stupid all the way, putting their lives in danger, for no apparent reason. The guy continues to return to the laboratory where he was forbidden to enter. Then is the relationship with a young woman and her son. Of course, it looks good, but it seems to be a lot of trouble. It's just a fairly long waste of time. Even his tiranosur suit seems to have come from the shelf to a Star Trek convention.
