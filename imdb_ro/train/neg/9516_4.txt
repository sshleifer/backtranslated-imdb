Frank Sinatra plays a former soldier and frustrated, hard-to-live and hard-to-drink writer who returns to his hometown in Midwestern and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the city shot with a disinterested wife and fiery daughter . Frank gets involved in Dean Martin's play, invisible flower Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle with a good woman. A much simplified drama that enters the soap opera with MacLaine's role, which is therefore too colorful and sentimental embarrassing (her bored beat on "After you're gone" is still the culmination of the movie and is being manipulated with perfection ). Director Vincente Minnelli supervises him directly, but he is in surprising spirits, and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The image looks incredibly beautiful in wide screen with a nice eye for details and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the yeast. ** from ****
