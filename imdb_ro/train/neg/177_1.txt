If you're going to see this movie, please review it. I usually do not post my comments about something I've seen on TV, but it was a waste of my life that I had to do something productive to get the bad taste out of my mouth. The critics of this film would take too long because there are so many things wrong with him. I'll just say, please do not ever see this movie. It was a complete loss of my time and it will be a waste of yours. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; completely inept or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you will really regret seeing this movie!
