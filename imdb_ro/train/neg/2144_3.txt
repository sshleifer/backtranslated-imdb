I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen (followed by Peter Pan 2 and some other sequels, like The Lion King 2 and Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these films are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to do it by filling with jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they do most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I'd give it 1/10. But now I'm thinking about it, most kids do not care how good the original movie is, but just that the movie is fun. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's horrible. Now I think it's worth a 3/10.
