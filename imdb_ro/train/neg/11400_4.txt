The Hazing is a mumbo-jumbo confused who wants to be so hard to be The Evil Dead, which really makes Bruce Campbell many times. The problem is, it's just not in the same league as that great movie. This film is far from original. The plot was used before, by Kevin Tenney in the Demons' Night, and that was much more fun. This film escapes too much time, with a complicated exposition, before bringing their children to the scary mansion and starting the demonic happenings. Brad Dourif is not given, as usual, much to do here, but when he is on the screen he puts it in another performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As far as the action of children is concerned, it is acceptable, but in no case good. Crazy camera work is more annoying than intelligent or atmospheric. There are some good moments when the first guy gets possessed and threw around some dead ships while sending his victims, but he was never scary for a second. The level of the gore is from half to low, but the director tries to compensate him by showing topless actresses a few times. All in all, just fine if you have 87 minutes to lose.
