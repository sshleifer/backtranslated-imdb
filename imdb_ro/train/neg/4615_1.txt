Maybe I do not have the most attention, but this is the second film I have refused to see and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I waited for a resolution, something to laugh, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. Rather, the writing was amateur, and the film dragged and felt disconnected, as if someone cut a series of long-length TVs. Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this film for not less than eight Oscars. Again, I repeat. This is the second film I have refused to watch. The first was the "Exterminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
