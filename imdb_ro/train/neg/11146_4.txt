Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I really did not feel kidnapped by my money to rent, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the action is pretty bad, but the song is beautiful. Direction is acceptable, but the effects are horrific, especially the werewolf effects, which, in a werewolf film, is a pretty big problem. It was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which for me is a pretty good thing, but it was not that hot. Generally, it's pretty direct media to the video, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're bored with a fan of genre, check it out sometime. I'll watch him again. The bonus factor for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them), plays the werewolf.
