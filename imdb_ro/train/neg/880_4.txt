Garson Kanin wrote and directed this aspect to the Las Vegas "modern day" and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort in the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat mischievous as a large casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcerted as an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: defensive, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this cool and relaxed role requires too much from Janssen, who releases everyone as a rude husband put-on (even he cheats Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a researcher looking for his own identity, comments on his hips about how young people look at Vegas (I give them ten more years), and his disapproval of father's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-secretary and Edy Willaims has a bit of fun as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, the movie "Where is it" has nothing but the rumors about the ethics of adults and their children, some quick shots and a funny satirical jet on the big world of gambling - most of which was covered so far, ad nauseum. ** from ****
