A warning not to be seduced by Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is useless and impractical and made me think of Twain's expression of the desire for all the characters to be drowned together. When someone brings the category "The worst movies ever made", he does not like _Plan 9 or _Attack of the Shrews Killer, which I'm thinking about; it's about that. What a complete loss of time - mine and all those involved in this film.
