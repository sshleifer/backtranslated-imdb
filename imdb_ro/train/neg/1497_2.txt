Understand that I'm reviewing the movie I've seen. I realize that virtually all nudity and gore were cut off from this film, making it completely sterilized. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew I would not get a horror classic, but at least I expected boys and bloodshots. But no, this movie must be the most horror film of modern horror, that is, it's easy to say that there is much more for certain scenes, "but they are suddenly cut or the scene ends even when it starts. to cheat the cannibal stars and porn? I mean it's a winning formula, makes me wonder if the director slept with a director's wife or something, because it's literally amazing how much he was cut off from that. a few years in Fangoria, I was excited, they looked like a fun movie, but unfortunately the real movie is locked in a vault somewhere and we have to endure this piece of famous Evil Breed excrements. Let's hope that one day it will be released an unrated rating because I think there is a good movie in this mess, but until then the best grab a 12-pack Bud pack, because the only way you'll make it through this movie.
