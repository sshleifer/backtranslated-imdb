I am amazed by some reviews of this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The land is extremely lazy. It's not scary. People there who think that because she wears Sarah Michelle Geller is somewhat like The Grudge should forget her. This film is rather Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and moves slowly than it. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It did not scare me, I do not even care about me. Let's admit this type of plot was beaten to death at this stage, the dead try to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, The Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones who write original horror movies are the Japanese and the Koreans. Hollywood movies such as these are cynical exercises in terms of earning money without respect for the spectator. They're just tortured
