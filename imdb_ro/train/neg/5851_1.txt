I doubt that Jigsaw was a hip even then, the entire LSD theme married a mystery of murder being an obviously obvious attempt to attract a young audience of the era, without really showing any understanding of the contraction of the sixties . Beyond that look, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including the bad, bloody and silly dialogue, the LSD flashbacks that go on endlessly long even after the point has been knocked home in the first 60 seconds, the failure to create a true even if the real plot is on paper an excellent vehicle to do this, and an end that is so cute and predictable (not to mention a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually a anticlimax. If it were a better movie, we could suspend the mistrust in a few things that would help to pleasure, but the weaknesses are so clear that they only serve to highlight the improbes that viewers might otherwise overlook. I've seen Jigsaw on TV and it's definitely the TV night fair to fill up the airspace and pass the time to kill someone's insomnia rather than anything else they should actively seek. At best, three out of ten.
