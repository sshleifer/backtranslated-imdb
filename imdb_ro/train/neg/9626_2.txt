Do not bones about it. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. It is climb all the way, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: Characters. There is a boring, lucky guy - giving Stiller another note in his boring and unfortunate belt - the wild, but really normal, relationship that Aniston plays well, but he did not need any effort to do it - the jovial friend and then the assortment of cliques: an annoying Australian guy, a confident Spanish guy, etc. The story: the beginning is a little unusual, but then comes in the standard style of any movie, each plot being just as predictable as your average suspicion. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character seemed to come from nothing - like the average play in school, the writers knew where it started and where it ended, but did not put enough in what it says thoroughly. Finally, the supposed "jokes" were nothing but hideous versions of raw standard humor; there was a regulatory scene for gambling, fat fat males, etc. In conclusion, the simple fact about this movie is that understanding the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg really gave a dog dinner here, and Stiller's and Aniston's sugar coating could have lured the spectators, but the taste left at the end was just as rancid. Final comment: This movie may have been terrible, but Aniston has still chosen a better film between the seasons and the film than Kudrow's odious "Mark X".
