Apparently, the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders on the ground doing self-mutilation as a way to cope with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because without listening to a commentary by director Andy Copp (which I did not have) or reading the movie before watching, the viewers will have no idea what this is about. Gorehounds and extreme movie fans can be lured into watching Human Mutilation with the promise of harsh scenes of splashing and unsettling real-life scenes, but if they are not also passionate about pretense, which provokes headache, an experimental cinema, will find him a real chore. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly pictures accompanied by discomfort, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind is a perfect way to test your health: if you still have all the marbles, you will change the garbage and you will watch something decent (I've looked at everything, but I know very well that I'm licking completely!).
