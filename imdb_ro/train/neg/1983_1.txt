Oh, let's give this movie a break. The only thing I liked was ......... I'm sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh yes!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. I'm sorry, the wrong film, I thought of a quality movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Yes, the Clueless chick was in it. Do not put down Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But, boy, Stacy, you did a dooooosie. One thing that has never been done in a Western cast, even a feminine, has actually hung a woman from hanging. That could be the first west. Even if her neck had been broken and she had survived the assault, you still have to give the director an effort to try a vest first. Also, I never saw a woman lynched from a horse in any West, although it did not happen in this movie, I thought to give the director another idea about Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done immediately after the bride of Ed Wood monster # 2. Perhaps that's what the producers of this movie did. Orginity, especially with an African woman expressed and an oriental cowgirl. Heeey, if the producers of Gang Of Roses want to continue this mess, you could have such a slang as, "Hey, you can not think of my girls" and "talk with your hand, baby, talk with your hand." You could also have a surfer-type marshal who says things like, "That war was TOTAL RAD man in all." You know stuff like that.
