The person who wrote the brilliant review of this wrong project must be related to the writer / director / star - or is, in fact, the same person who defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone who is not connected to the tightly-knit inner circle. What do you say about this? You want to make a movie - tell a story; fun; drag me with live characters. Sure, you can do it with art without leaning on commercial items for mass appeal. However, do not address the elements of artistic expression in a vacuum where the audience is in a continuous struggle to understand the disturbing narrative threads. If I want to be moved by a living psychological thread, then the fabrics in the concrete are easier to buy.
