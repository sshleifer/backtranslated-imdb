Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's films, obviously his masterpieces in the 70's (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his plays in the 1980s and early 90s (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners , Husbands and Wives), I actually liked even some of his more recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Crooks), but that was great, though it could not have been worse than in the last few years, but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> He was lazily planned - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Murter and Little Time Crooks with all the jokes pulled out - Woody seems to be on his way and also slurring the most much of his lines and bringing "hilarious" phrases. I mean, with all due respect ... "always and until the smell becomes more empty, I know most of the actors expect to work with him, but they should at least read the first scenario - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than that - and Woody really should take more behind the role of the room in the future if it makes any sense about 20 miles behind him. It would not be so tragic if it did not have had so many big movies Woody compare this to - but it is clear that the best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call it the day before he becomes a joke in the industry.
