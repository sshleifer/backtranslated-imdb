Moron and girlfriend make a ritual to raise the dead, trying to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. It is not surprising that they raise a dead soul who begins to cut them with the ax, and the next day, some school-age people tell the story around the campfire. The guy with the ax returns and starts hacking idiots by telling the story. The group calls the cops, the policeman sees the blood splashed everywhere and thinks he is a mountain lion (!?) And soon after him is directed by a deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moroon's little film, which was filmed in the light of day, but where several characters wear lanterns and talk as if they were in the middle of the night and wanted to send a beep to attract attention . One has a gun in one hand and one bullet in the other, but it does not bother to load it, after he finally loads it, he has more opportunities to shoot the killer, but he does not bother, because that will end the movie too soon. Then throw the gun away! There are also harmful characters who do not show emotion and do not look the least worried after their friends are cut into pieces and unwanted effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken, the car overturned to the end was a clear model car ) and a horrible dialogue and a very ugly female nudity do not help. And finally, he tries to escape with incoherence by telling them that it was all the invention of the same age-old colleague, telling camp stories at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer actually lights up in the last scene he scatters into pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Mediocre of this kind, good only for some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
