Well, artyfartyrati from Cannes would have wanted this movie, but I'm not afraid. If you like the movie type in which the photos persist so much that you wonder if the actor slept or the cameraman went to the table then it could be for you. Much of it is like this one, with short stays in the unpleasant field. I did not find it shocking or disturbing, as other reviewers have - just a little disgusting and meaningless. The only reason I did not give this star is that the act is commendable and the movie is pretty well shot. However, the plot does not have much to recommend. Much of the film shows only a frightening woman teaching or listening to the piano, which might attract some people. But do not think it's harmless enough to be prepared for some tricks of pornography and sexual violence just to get a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
