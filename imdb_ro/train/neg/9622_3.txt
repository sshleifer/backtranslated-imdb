When I saw that this movie was on TV, we really were looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980s and, like everyone else who grew up in that era, they saw the adolescence and summer camp in the 80's. So I could not wait to see this movie that spoils the genre. What a disappointment !! The film was nothing but a bunch of jokes and very bad gags, from time to time, with almost no plot or substance. And filmmakers are trying to fill the darkness entirely - some of these so-called jokes came as nothing but cruel and offensive. The only good things about this movie were the closet, music and acting. It was nice to go on a journey of nostalgia and see all the summer clothing styles of the 1980s, and the same goes for music. And the act was top-notch across: almost all the best Hollywood comedies were present. Too bad they did not have better work to do.
