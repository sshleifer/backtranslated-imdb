When you make a thriller about witchcraft, I think you should do everything you can to help the audience to suspend their mistrust for the movie to work. Some images ("Baby Rosemary," for example) have accomplished this; others (such as "Necromancy") do not have and the scary potential material meets like weirdness. This film has some atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogue is hard to find (sometimes it's badly recorded, otherwise it's incomprehensible), and Orson Welles, who gets the top billing, has a role that BENEATH is supposed to do that he is desperate for work. Or maybe it's just fun ..... (* 1/2)
