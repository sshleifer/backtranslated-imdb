102 Dalmatian (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) Cruella de Vil (Close) is considered to be cured, and is released from prison and is preparing to make a new start in life. Things go well for Cruella, who is busy helping homeless street dogs. When the clock hits Big Ben, things are bad. Hypnotic healing is reversed, and Cruella returns, and this time he is determined to make that layer he always wanted. Glenn Close takes on the role of Cruella de Vil and again is the climax of the film. Every scene with her is worth watching in this boring sequel that feels like a repeat of the previous movie, rather than a new story. She has been changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
