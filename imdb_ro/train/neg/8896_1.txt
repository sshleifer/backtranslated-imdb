I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and have watched movies as long as I remember. I can say frankly that the Brigade is the only, by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better sets. The characters were so woody that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to look at them. It is hoped that the stars of this film were hiding thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment they had to suffer when they saw this film. The owners of this tribute should do a wonderful service to mankind and destroy all the copies of this film.
