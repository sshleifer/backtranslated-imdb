If you watched this movie, you know why I told him "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ..." I laughed at "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did we rent this movie?" I can not believe that Oscar winners, like Freeman and Spacey, came here in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J took the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Draco actors! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and I think I'm not much fun about him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, naked and annoying like a hell. I was happy when both were thrown out on the street. The story was good and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad part very well. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake has destroyed everything. It would have been very enjoyable without him. By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared, the movie turned into an MTV video with flash, low motion and stuff like that. Something forgotten about this police film, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video for Timberlake.
