This movie is funny and painful at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost gave me a confiscation. Despite what it means, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical procedure. She was "developed" as a result of an accident and used it because she disguised that their "monsters" were so stupid. I also do not think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid "Pink". This movie is good for a laugh, if you're even looking for a 9-day movie for $ 200,000. It's fun; at least I can say about it. Battle / rat / spider is the climax.
