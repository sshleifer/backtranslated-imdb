Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie in which a guy I have never seen before or since I played as a guy in the neighborhood who is trying to become an actor. He has a hard jones for Taxi Driver as he tries to use this shtick to make great. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everybody does, he changes his image! He's going from a good guy to a surfing pattern overnight. His friend can not figure out change (but scratches Faith Ford and gets a pleasant pleasure). Can this young punk keep his faith in the streets making him big? This is a really brilliant movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that breaks down due to inadequate execution. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run because movie makers have hit the ball this time. Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br />
