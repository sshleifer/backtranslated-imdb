Although I heard that this movie was a bit dry, I look at what Scott Bakula does. At the beginning of this movie, I had high hopes for the strange but pleasant girl Scott-get-girl, and up to 20 minutes before the end was going well. The draft plot was crazy, unexpected and very intelligent. I kept my fingers crossed so that it would solve it and would be a horrible misunderstanding even until the credits rolled and I realized that it would not be a happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I regret that I chased them and made a quantum leap to restore my belief in the goodness of Great Scott!
