The serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases by the power of the mind. Instead, it creates a kind of monster that has to eat human flesh and brain. The mad dock creates some zombies in the corpses and has some problems. There is a very long lead in the action, with many scenes that make you familiar with the characters. The crazy doctor's nephew gets into a car accident, and the crazy doctor tries to use his new serum for the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with OK acting, but some directional problems and some continuity errors. There are not many zombie actions in this case and the effects, while they are appropriate, are nothing special. You can quickly move through the slow parts and enjoy scenes of action. Beware of nudity and bad language.
