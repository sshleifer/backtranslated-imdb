After being extremely entertained by Mr. Brosnan's performance as "The Tailor of Panama" (which I vote 10/10 on a large scale: casting, acting, script, story, editing, rhythm, music, emotional impact etc. ), We anticipated this movie with enthusiasm. I was very disappointed. It's a script that does not read a movie, vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in all the ways that "Tailors in Panama" is rich and satisfying. Bring it on the screen and write. I stayed in the theater waiting for the "good side"; never came. I did not laugh or cry, though a dialogue line made me smile. $ 7 worth? Hard.
