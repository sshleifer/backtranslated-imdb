(Spoilers) I was really curious to see this movie after I heard it was smart and full of witchcraft. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: showing how the relationship between man and woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a large city can experience. What made me entertain the whole movie was two things. Firstly, the movie was so down in the ground that it seemed that describing the problems a couple had to solve in a day-for days, became common and boring. Secondly, the general weakness of production, with difficult to understand dialogues. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
