I watched the first 15 minutes, believing it was a real documentary (with an irritating dramatically "camera maker"). When I realized that everything was staged, I thought, "Why would I want to waste my time watching this junk?" So we stopped it and came online to warn other people. Characters do not act in a credible way. too much immature emotion. for a guy to travel half-way around the world to a war-torn country, he acted as a child. and I do not think it was because "his character was so upset about the bombings in the shopping center." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I liked!
