As Steven Segal's films are at the bottom of the barrel. The best thing was just feeding for bored adolescents. It deflects the scales, then falls. Characters are all cardboard. The story is double blades. I can not hurt him by telling him the end. You already know how all Steven Segal's films are over if you've seen one. Here it goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who knows too much to change his mind so that they decide instead of killing him to beat his brain until he does not remember squatting. He escapes, of course, is arrested and is located by his old general, who needs a single man in a million experience to get a stealth plane that was handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan by an Air Force pilot , surprise, surprise, Segal trained. All heroes, except for Segal's character and his girlfriend, die heroically, and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in a single loop or collapses. Regardless. Made with a surplus of air force and flying film. And many boom-booms. Instead of making some Popeye cartoons.
