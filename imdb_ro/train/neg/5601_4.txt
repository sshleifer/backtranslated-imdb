I watched just because he was directed by Lucio Fulci and introduced Claudio Cassinelli, an actor he likes. I was definitely disappointed. The idea that prisoner convicts would fight to death for TV ratings was overburdened with the role of Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie, Death Race, which surely sucks for playing Jason Statham. This was just a piece for the most part. Action "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. "Training" was a snooze-fest. He never took me and never made me care of anyone, including the Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Choose one of the others mentioned and you will be better.
