I could not believe how dreadful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but I thought "Diane Keaton always deserves to look." I am corrected. All those involved should hang their heads in shame. I realize there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the scenario was so inept, clich√© and confusing that I am surprised that she has ever been in development or that Mrs. Keaton thought she might make a bag of silk from the sow's ear. None of the characters had any credibility and was so incredibly inappropriate. The act looked like an exercise in an EARLY class - I looked in open horror, by the vast majority of this question: "What did they think?" Very, very sad he got to this. Do not waste time.
