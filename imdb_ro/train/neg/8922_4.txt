Two elderly people sitting on a park bench. I do not have a problem with this scene - The only problem is that it is not a scene where the whole movie is Yup movies no longer have a lower concept than that. They are also no more boring than that, but it's worse to come because these two elders are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is Yiddish communist, while the other is Midge Carter a former gold gloves champion who is also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench, going well. I think it is possible, though unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why is the Jewish stereotype playing? Why do you make the thieves of sad tribes, who take a Hebrew oath? It is a little ironic that the Jews seen at the beginning of the film are precisely the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films of the 1930s. The stereotypes as soft as I leave the issue with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that "it is written for a very different medium from cinema, is based on a stage play and shows it. Walter Matthau makes his sleep as Nat's, while this commentator almost slept in the whole movie
