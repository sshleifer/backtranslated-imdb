OK .... I only have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only redeeming feature of this film is Dean Cain. Besides that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! The film does NOT have a promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real live fire dragon - basically gives us more than "Jurassic Park" meets "Reign of Fire" ... There are a few great possibilities, but they are not following. The special effects are decent - even if you know the dragon is CGI, it's not terrible LOOK like CGI .... I would not blame Dean Cain (although one of the producers), I would blame Phillip Roth - the director and the writer. It's his job to make this movie .... and unfortunately, he failed.
