This film could not decide what it wanted to be. There have been a few sub-plots that for some time have made you think that all of these things will eventually unite ... but they did not. If you want a "stranger in frozen waste" story, stay with the 1950 version of THE THING (not the abomination that has been remodeled in gore-o vision after 20 years and later). not surpassing the fact that "aliens" seemed quite recycled from Independence Day. <br /> <br /> The bare minimum sets would have been more effective if they hired actors who could act and fulfill the desired mood. A lot of landscapes that chew with small payouts.
