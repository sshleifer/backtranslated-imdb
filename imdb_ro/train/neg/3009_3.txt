This song continues to buzz my head. Not the biggest song, but it's the 80s. This film is about a lead singer who "supposedly" gets killed while being accused of murder while watching his girlfriend singing a spare voice in his band. The singer who calls Billy "Eye" (Da, Right) is dead after two years, and his band is back for a concert, only the vocalist is the lead singer this time. Billy crosses her and eventually goes around killing all these people and scaring her face and making people around her think something is wrong with her and she imagines things. Finally, he decides to go to a cemetery and dig his grave to see if he's still there. She sees he's dead, but he still sees and hears his voice. During the movie, Billy has a brother named John (again), and John admits he's jealous of his brother and has killed all those people to come back to him and to blame his brother and then, and takes her girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The end is very noisy, and the act is very blades and wood. But ... I like it anyway. I'm looking at the song. I wish I were.
