Others have already commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he demonstrated, playing in "Exorcist III"), why did he agree to appear in this? Sure, he offers adequate dementia performance, and the movie is not really bad; is just lacking in involvement, uninteresting and untouchable. There are three "too". (* 1/2)
