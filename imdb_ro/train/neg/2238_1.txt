Video quality is terrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The actor is horrible. Dialogue is painful. Lighting is tough. Editing is ridiculous. I can go on, but it would be useless. Snitch'd is a third-rate amateur video that has been transferred as a feature film. It is best left to collect dust in the store store video store.
