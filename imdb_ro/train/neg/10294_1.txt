Nothing is happening. Then the characters without personality do not develop. Then the end never comes because there is no beginning and no means. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful photos that are not made beautiful because they are not allowed to be, because this movie does not even exist. There is no "is" in this movie because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion, dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But playing sound is such, and the movie itself is such that watching it is not even worth the time, so if you are really interested, I would suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something. You will get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue, headache and impatience. - PolarisDiB
