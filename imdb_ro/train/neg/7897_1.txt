This movie was made for those who found Gremlins too seriously and Critters for hardcore. Like many of the critter / trolls / gremlins movies from the 1980s, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no point of view for this comment. It's just bad and not funny. The problem with this wonderful monster movie is that it's actually trying to be fun and it's just as successful in making Howie Mandell in Walk Like A Man. What the other 80 horror movies made in the classic was that they really tried to be scary, but they were hilarious because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for comedy before she started directing this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Indeed, seeing a strange mutant cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from Lost Boys is fun, but not enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> By far, the most annoying part of the movie is the character Paul. Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to get you started quickly from the first scene until the final credits just stop to see a scene where a munch throws pool balls at a guy ... not that I did that . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
