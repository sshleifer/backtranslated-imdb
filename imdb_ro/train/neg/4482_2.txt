Perfect atrocity ... I doubt if one shot lasts longer than MTV claimed 4.4 seconds. Damn, worse than in the Kusminsky version (a reminder: he managed to destroy Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey - the rich have received what they deserve. Darkness and defeat Heathcliff reduced to the status of a dark golden angel, Catherine scary and angel presented as a dandelion filled with snails, full of snails, gentle and weak Linton is a peeping tom and innocent Isabel becomes the character of Sara Michelle-Gellar from Cruel intentions. 15 years old, Eddie Bauer and donors Abercrombie and Fitch - take note. This has been done for you. It's a music video of an hour and a half long, in which everything is given to you; you are saved by the inconvenient necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even the initial shock of their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said earlier, they were deceived. The decent photo, but the editing is at the level of the high school TV production class. I beg you all: read the book or even cliffnotes; watch his earlier versions, even Kusminsky's; but stay away from the many future reps, in which you will not get the free commercial premiere.
