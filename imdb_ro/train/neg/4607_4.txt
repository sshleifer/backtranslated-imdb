You can not imagine how I look forward to the King of the Ants. As a massive fan of Gordon, I waited for the European premiere with a bad anticipation, especially since I loved Dagon's last achievement - Gordon - so much. The King of the Trainers had the premiere here in my country, and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately, I could not congratulate him for it afterwards. King of the Ants is his most insidious and mediocre film to date. Indeed, the quality level has not exceeded the usual standards of the TV thriller. The plot plot is terribly routine and, except for some bad scenarios, typical Gordon-touch is never recognized. In addition, the already thin script has more holes than a Swiss cheese bowl! This is a young man who is committed to commit a crime. So he does and, of course, I do not pay him. Of course he falls in love with the wife of the victim and, of course, takes revenge on himself. Only the sequences in which a guy descends into a spiral of madness is worth mentioning and they are the only ones who remind you that you are watching a Stuart Gordon movie. The acting shows are below average, with McCenna as heroic low life, George 'Norm Peterson' Wendt as a bad bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good sex bomb. The extremely illogical things happen constantly and the boredom of the story becomes very irritating, while the makeup effects are not enough to satisfy even amateur-horror fans. I read some other comments about the King of the Ants, claiming to be Gordon's best, because it is ultimately a provocative and mature movie. Well, if that's the case. Rather, I remain immature and give Re-Animator another view, much. Well, I think every good director is doing steam and inspiration in the end. Too bad he got over Stuart Gordon.
