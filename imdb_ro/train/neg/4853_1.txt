I am a great fan of war films and, as a Vietnam veteran, I have an experience with technical details. I've been working with the bombs several times, and I've only had respect for them. Other veterinarians, especially veterans from Iraq, have very well summarized the inaccuracies of this film. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and it does not work badly for that. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this dishonest operator for more than 5 minutes. The military unit grants a reasonable prize and discipline for a reason, saves lives. The opening scene bothered me a lot. The guy with the cell phone would have been shot right away. Spreading, "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent effect. He got sick of it. Sniper scenes have been particularly bad. As the others have noticed, your average EOD guy does not know to be a sniper and to think any Arab sniper is so good that he stretches his imagination. The kidnapping of an Arab businessman for a certain form of personal revenge would not happen. Someone might shoot him, but this kind of risk is limited to movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have highlighted these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins a prize, it is a further reflection of why La La Land is so called.
