I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like animation, cartoons very early in the morning, only worse in some scenes. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, such as Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was really naughty in the original, but she has lost her quality. What she said was not at all writing at home, and her animation was a little ugly. Also, his artist partner, Lars, was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good, and especially Barry Bostwick like Thunderbolt, except for Jodi Benson, the accent destroyed me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated and very suggestive for an extended TV episode. Overall, a very disappointing sequel to the most memorable of Disney movies of the 1960s and the Jungle Book. I'm sorry, I can only give him 3/10, it was not just a cup of tea. Bethany Cox
