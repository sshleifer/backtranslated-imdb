Many people see this as a classic, but obviously they must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty boring - meaning a movie about Anarene's life in Texas in the early 1950s will be pretty boring! What do so many people see in this? Once the last image of Anarene shows up there, there will be nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) does this at the end of the movie. But just before it closes, there is not much to do, so everything rotates around sex. High school students are planning to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the same bored adults in town. You see, he has nothing to do with them - than to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with bored adolescents) or to drink about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought would add some spark to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), but nothing is happening because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) This is why. The only thing that added something of dramatic value to the film came to an end with Billy's death (Sam Bottoms), which really shows the nakedness of life in this tiny little town, as men sit around to look at the body by debating where to go to breakfast. Peter Bogdanovic shot this in black and white, intending to emphasize how gray this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early appearance of actors Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (On the one hand, it was terrible to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually portrayed his character as Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation). I do not think! 3/10
