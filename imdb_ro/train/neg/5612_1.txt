As spiritualist and non-Christian. I thought it would really hold on to my faith, but what cargo do I see. I thought the movie would have big arguments, but it only got unilateral opinions from atheists and Jews ??? And who these street people are interviewing who do not know the back of their arm? Where are the theologians and priests and the things they could get arguments. They did not give up the nuts who wrote books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and it does not deserve to give me time to check whether the facts are good or wrong or whether or not they should I have to believe, because an antichrist said so. Please believe that he has come to the conclusion that he has not found God, because his own ego and demons have had more of it. I'm not going to say that the movie was amazing to help atheists read this feel better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world in which you are interested in our poor souls who believe in Jesus, then attract us with your value, not the beatings on the drums.
