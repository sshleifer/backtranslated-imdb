A Stinko in a movie that has a carved plot in the store and, to be good, has a lower quality than the Oscar. But for me the only worst defect was the total representation of a jet-powered aircraft, especially a 747. Some of the biggest holes: 1. No flight engineer (or even a flight engineer) 2. Mis-identification of F-16 interceptors as F-15 (no resignation) 3. Loading of passengers in an assumed posterior baggage compartment accessible from the cabin - Even if such a compartment existed, placing that too much weight that would be could not make the aircraft inapplicable 4. Bullets with empty points that "will not damage the airplane" 5. The whole landing procedure was so bad I wanted to get him tangled. SR-71 (from all airplanes) with a pressure seal roof 7. Opening a cabin door outdoors - in the wind - in flight! <br /> <br /> No, it was just a really bad movie. list of the last 10 years of the year.
