as an actor I really like independent movies, but this is amateur at best. Boys go to Vermont for a public service even when the plane landed flying over a palm - were the executives aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pini da - no palms. And so for the wedding service - again, a beautiful palm grove. When the boys leave VT, it seems they could not get a ticket to any major airline, because the airplane filmed is Federal Express. Did they sell overnight in a cage? Come small guys details like this indi separated movie from a total of amateurs. The Christian brother is much more gay than Arthur with his white hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have changed their roles. Minor characters are ridiculous and overcome something terrible. Applause for directors to make a gay movie, but to pay attention to your locations and next time
