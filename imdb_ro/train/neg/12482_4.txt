Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and sees Rick Hill, a kind of body builder and famous for that if I get it right? Pluton follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from the evil gentleman and has to travel to the Lord's cave. He meets many dwarves and monsters during his trip, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of a huge success of Conan, and even if it is a very bad movie, it has many wonderful garbage merits and is recommended for fans of rubbish and drug drug tolerance! There are many cinematic merits in this movie. The couple's scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker's focus is to look are nude females and immense Hill muscles. Females are usually helpless and very poor victims, too, this is a very macho movie and therefore can not please many feminists! Battle scenes are nothing special and boring, and monsters are never special. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateur and badly done, but what would you expect from the low budget effort like this one? That's trying to be as big as Conan, but it's very miserable. As I said, this can be enjoyed by fans of Turkish cinema, but no one else. This belongs to the category is so bad that it's great! Deathstalker is not as close to how bad it may be, and like a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys, the ones of course! If the bad movies are a cup of tea, then try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "pleasant pleasing movies," then stay away. And if someone can not bear a large amount of nudity, then stay away. There is more nudity here than violence, and thanks to these scenes the movie has a rating R. Otherwise it could be a safe movie in the PG family!
