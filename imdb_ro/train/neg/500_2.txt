Bloodsucker leads the dance - which title of laughter, is so completely deceptive. It is not surprising that filmmakers are trying to deceive us, because this is a terrible movie. The story essentially involves a mystery of murder in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little is happening in this movie. And when something awakens the spectator to his stupor, it is invariably an unintentional comedy, in the form of an atrocity dialogue, conducted by a hopeless group of vocal artists. These guys are so bad that the actors who make the voices look like a group of retaliation villains. It is very difficult to determine how bad it is to act when you have doubled that abyss. But the voice artists can not be accused of scenario. It's a transvestity. Unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story, in general, is at least uneven. Women's characters are particularly idiotic; men are either frightening or tiring. The entire business demonstrates the pure exploitation of the public. It does not perform remotely what promises, and even when crimes (eventually) begin to happen, everything happens out of the screen. All we get is a few half-hearted headshots. Some people have said that this movie is a giallo. I can not agree with this less. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this film a great place, because there is no thrill on him. It's basically a porn-soft porn movie. But it's not very erotic. I can not recommend this to anyone.
