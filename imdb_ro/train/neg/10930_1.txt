This movie is a total dog. I woke up to find something to laugh, so I would not feel like I was wasting my money - and my time. Writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It's a shame that it does not meet the standards of other Hale Storm films. He should have saved the money to get D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working on the script until he was right. Even Gary Coleman was not used properly for his role. This movie lets you wonder what is the biggest part of the plot - including the subplots. After watching this movie, I was left with the impression that the producers are hoping to capture a kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where there are not so many lines like character and delivery. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver lines, characters, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
