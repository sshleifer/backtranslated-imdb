This movie is a joke and must be one of the most serious Stallone movies ever made. This is a typical 80s movie in which a single man destroys the entire army alone. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there you kill the terrorist Arnold, while here you have a particular nation shown as bad boys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, it was the tip of the Cold War, but I'm tired of always showing the Communists or the Nazis as an enemy. There are so many American films that share the same thing. Why can not there be a movie showing Americans as an enemy? Who will think that only one soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think this would have happened? By its look, an average spectator, American-washed brain would certainly be.
