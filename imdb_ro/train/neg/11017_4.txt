A woman's nightmares feed her fear of being buried alive. The husband of deceit wants her dead and decides to use her good phobia, sticking it in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, the queen of B-horror Brinke Stevens turns into a fantastic creature creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk movie is Michael Berryman in a very small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last 20 minutes of Brinke's bloody fraud are pretty fun to watch. The special effects, for example, ridiculous The beheaded head is really terrible. I better watch "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect fun from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be enjoyable.
