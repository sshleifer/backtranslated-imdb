The king died to live the king! The Caddy Shack Two Triad, Staircase Family and Beverly Hills Troop have been linked to the worst film over time that they seemed icons per se. But there is a new king ..... yes ..... all hate the new king .... "Down on Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, are so bad they're good. One day, this could take a "unmistakable" cult movie. So just go see this ... this ... well, take my word for it. Go see. Greet the new king!
