In the first of these were mainly giant rats, but there were a few wasps and a giant chicken too. This, however, is only a period of giant rats, well-giant rats and a really growing little boy. This is about this growing boy and about a scientist trying to help him, so he can accidentally create giant murderers ... you know what he is like. This movie has some kills and its moments, but it seems to me that it is in the same position as the original, I just prefer a variety in my giant creatures. Well, that's not true ... I really like the "Empire of the Ants," maybe I just do not care about giant rodents. All in all a pretty bad movie, though it has a rather strange change of events in this dream sequence that is really bizarre. I can not recommend this one.
