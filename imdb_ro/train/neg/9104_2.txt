<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it was done. Cruel intentions, in my opinion, were one of the best adolescent-oriented films made over the years. This prequel had some incongruity with the original. (Sebastian's father married wealth, then why does he have a rich aunt on the long island?) Then I learned today that it was not really meant to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. I heard that, it was logical that it was not the same thing as the movie, as Buffy Vampire Slayer differs in TV format. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble has probably added the end of the movie after the series was not taken by Fox. It looks like something that will happen too soon (Sebastian becomes Katharyn's masculine version) and I do not know where it would go with the next episode because it would not have led to the 1999 movie (which the newest end is heading to the right. ) One thing I did not like was that he suggested that Sebastian and his father were married in wealth, which usually did not look good in this New York area, and Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of she did not seem to be a woman in her position to marry a man, not her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel this is pretty lame. But I would have been interested in seeing where this went like a series.
