I was very happy with Margaret Atwood's novel "The Bride Bride," and I was thrilled to see a cinematic version. A woman puts a police friend for her own crime, and her friend, a former journalist of the police, tries to free her name, checking out the crazy friends of the dead woman. It is fortunate that the film's script sets Mrs Atwood's clumsy plot, focusing on the story of the two men, the victims of the women who were delighted ... Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book and I'm pretty sure they're fully prepared for the film, I'm going to eat the dust cover of my copy of the paper. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to wear the film. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting unless we see them happening with a man, and man's life is deceived. Pink, Charis, and Toni tell their stories to a man. Because it is not important if a man does not hear them. I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed by a man's story. Normally, I'm not looking for feminist angles in the media, and I've been trying to enjoy the movie as such. If I had not read the book, I would have enjoyed the film much more. So if you like the cop and the former cop and want to read more about them, you're not lucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy delicious prose and delicious, thin, layered plotting. It's the same scenario: the movie excavated it, ironed it and sprinkled it with male aggression. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
