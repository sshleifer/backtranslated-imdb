The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold and wet day. <br /> <br /> "The cat in the hat" was the name of the movie, and when it was over, my stomach was sick. Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and the kids did not have to see that, humor was not tampered with. <br /> <The film was like drinking milk, from a rabbit cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how. This film, in short, is atrocious. The actor was bad, the plot was optimized too much, and the humor was surprisingly brutal. Start with Conrad and Sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their mother has to go to work, she makes Ms. Kwan worry. Eventually, the funny part of the movie is when Ms. Kwan follows a Taiwan courtroom, a "C-SPAN". Soon asleep, and here Cat appears. The film starts to get out of control. The cat came to try to let the kids have fun. It has Thing 1 and Thing 2, which suddenly start destroying the house. He improvises an Infomercial TV and accidentally cuts his tail. And when the Cat approaches Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps his only funny disguise is like a hippie activist. And there's a fish trying to warn the kids about Cat. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that he did not warn us that this movie was as fun as sour milk or that you cut your tail. <br /> </ p> <p> Soon, the kids are out looking for the family dog, which has the key of a box on his collar. If the box is not locked up soon, their home will be home to the Cat universe. Here it becomes a bit more interesting, but not enough to save the movie. The act is generally horrible. Mike Meyers brings his unmistakable brand of Austin Powers to the cat, saying things like "you dirty ho" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life, after a testicle blow while posing as a pinnacle. Spencer Breslin is great like Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is as cute as Sally, though the only ones are not enough to save this terrible aortic dysfunction waiting to kill John Ritter (an accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin, the limp and blackmailer of Lawrence Quinn, is disgusting, ever trying to cheer on the mother of children played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the mother's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. The latter three are also mild. Generally, if I were a parent, I would not take my children into humor, because there is much more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. As the great Dr. Seuss once said, it's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Indeed, Universal, stop! Theodore is already returning to the grave. Like my mother always says: "Curiosity killed the cat." - Cat in the Shirt * of *****
