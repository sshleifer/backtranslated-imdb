Avoid the US version. It's with added American images and the worst doubling you've probably heard of amateurs in New York. Dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy in the Bronx makes Chiba's voice. I could not see the whole movie was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, watch other Chibei giants such as The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
