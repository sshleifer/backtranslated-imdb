I just watched an episode of this program and could not get to the end of the program. In every clip I've tracked, my I.Q program has to drop by about 10 points. This is essentially like a program for children, but with curses. Even the oath and insults she tells others do not make me laugh. However, the story has to be written by a monkey, and the people who put this scenario for this program by shooting must be kept at a gun point and have no choice but to film this delayed, disappointing and horrible program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some lesson lessons that would have done.
