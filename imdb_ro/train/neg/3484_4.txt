I remember when he was in the theater, reviews said it was horrible. I do not think it was so bad. It was fun and had a lot of tongue-to-cheek humor in terms of families around holiday time. Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house where he grew up and made a deal to rent his family there for Christmas. I really enjoyed the attorney's scene where he signed a contract. It was funny. So he makes bad family claims and even writes scriptures to read them. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And learn that the holidays are not so bad, after all. Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they first replaced a black guy, and the girl's parents did not even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah hits "the alleged daughter". VERDICT FINAL: I thought it worthwhile checking if you catch him by cable.
