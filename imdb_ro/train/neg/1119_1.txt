Even though this movie was a joke in response to criticism, it is still a terrible film. If anyone is going to get involved in such things, I'm gonna make him a good joke ... first of all, Jeroen Krabbé think Gerard Depardieu, the poor man ... ... of course, I hate Gerard Depardieu if he really funny in the "Iron Mask", three musketeers. Otherwise, he is the box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. Poisoning in the office of the poor man ... indeed, it is not fair to those who are not economically free. If the "fourth man" should be a kind of critic of the bourgeoisie ... what do they say? is not. Let's just say hypothetically, if it had to be, it was not sharp enough. Satire is a complicated thing ... if it is not sharp enough, the viewer gets the end of the joke instead ...... I think that's what happened. The story just ends up like a bunch of disgusting nasty characters who do nothing that nobody cares about and not in an interesting way either ..... (for a more interesting and useful application, see any movie Luis Bunuel .... very clear satire <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, the crushing work in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé's character makes it so hard for to touch .... Do you really care? is funny since Mr. Voerhoven should be a good film producer, I would offer the advantage of doubt and assume it was a misanthropic joke that got out of control ... although I suppose he did not put Jeroen Krabbé because he is the worst actor and every character he played was a pretentious bourgeois assistant .... except that he is incompetent to him. a strange caricature. You think Mr. Voerhoven did this with her and Jeroen Krabbé is the bottom of the joke? I do not see that ... So you understand the dilemma I'm facing here? It's the worst movie ever, because it should be a good director. So there is some kind of derision involved. I knew that "Patch Adams" was horrible without seeing him. Do not be deceived by "the misleading deceptive packaging of the fourth man or the reputation of Mrs. Voerhoven as a good director, etc."
