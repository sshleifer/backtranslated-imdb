So this guy named George is sitting alone on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in a hospital that takes care of their son, so when the wife is away, George enters the bubble bath and makes love for both girls. It's not so great for a scene, because it really does not show anything. After that, the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. I'm having a nice breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to escape them, but when he returns, the girls are still at him. Girls are tired of old George and do not want to cook for them. They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and that George's house was messy. George was not that great for his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he did not seem to understand it. George looked like Tom Tucker on the Guy family. I've been to the two girls all the time.
