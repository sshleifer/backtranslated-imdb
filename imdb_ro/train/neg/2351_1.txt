I have no idea how someone managed to stay awake during this show. The actor was funny, the story was old news, and the scenario of development (or lack thereof) invariably had my eyelids wrinkled less than half the episode. It's all about what to say about it, because it really lacked substance of any kind. How can you like people like this? It's terrible, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain more ... It's like some of you should look at the junk in mind just because you like what some actors look like or because for any crazy reason I've seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. I just ... we forget. This show was aspired and, fortunately, disappeared forever. I would like to go to work on the demolition of O.C. once and for all.
