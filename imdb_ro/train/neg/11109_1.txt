I'm very surprised that this movie has got a ranking like this! I have not seen such a bad movie for years. It was a very bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe unnecessary (almost fun) blood scenes). If you did not like the hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ... that's even worse 10 times. The story reminds me of RL Stine haybumps. I can not say about action, because the script was so terrible. Clich√© all the time. (why do I have to write 10 lines? I never understood that) <br /> <br /> <br /> Here comes the spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who kills people all the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of murders and no one gets any comments. In fact, these people are missing. And there is a good guy trying to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery to us because we know the bad guy from the beginning) and, as usual, nobody believes it! what a surprise! Finally put the butcher's clothes and fight the death with the murderer butcher!
