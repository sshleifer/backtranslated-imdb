This film makes Canadians and Britons asinine, moronlike idiots. Men are permeated / drunk and then scream / beat each other in almost every scene. Are women unnecessary for the story? I do not understand what they are there? they spend every scene that causes a shame or, worse, misery around the mesmerized cattle. It seems that Canadian women are either vulgar vultures or hippie chickens. She is a standard babe-up girlfriend, her lover's lover and his ruthless mummy mom that I've seen in countless movies before. Each character here is an infant carpet stereotype. Not to mention that everyone has shown that they need a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene involving sex with George Wendt? please? is enough to make someone gag! Did I watch the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I do not understand why he would have accepted such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is a gorgeous actor - the only one with a vague moment of redemption, but his talent is wasted here. As for the rest of the plot? the three imbecilists trying to get their backs? yawn - or Karl? who is actually a living character in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in the masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock - although I'm ashamed to even think of comparing these two films), why am I even bothering? Karl is so galling you will find the circumstances of his gratifying death. By the end of this fucking movie, I thought it would be better to go with him on that boat!
