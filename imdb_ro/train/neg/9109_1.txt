The first raw intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how much on earth could make such a bad continuation. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. In this case, Amy Adams is shit. It's terrible. And could not find a chicken that actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same color of hair! for good, come back. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is deceiving, deceptive and much worse than Sebastian in prequel. And what happens to the story line. Sebastian has a late at the first school, so he says the movie, although he does not mention anything about him and his life of meetings and how he was with girls. 2 Sebastian moves to New York and suddenly decides he will return. She falls in love with Danielle (maybe I remember you in the original version, Sarah Michelle Giller says "you broke up from the FIRST person you ever loved because I told her - how she might have been in love with prequel Si everything is beautiful and charming, and all the "good person" as he makes sex from the chick he makes his father, a movie of three, then seduces Cherry, I mean his terrible, I loved the first so much, but I did not even see the third one. I hope God is better than this prequel.
