If you only judged the movie, the commission that gave the A Chorus Line a Pulitzer Prize, and Broadway audiences who have kept the 15-year-old war horse were all on heavy narcotics, because a single sensation this movie safety is not. What possessed anyone to believe that Richard Attenborough was right for this material completely mystificates me, but he does a musical that is almost entirely about moving just to sit on the screen like a piece of clay. He is not content with the original score as originally written, someone has decided that what really needed the movie was a new new song to give the film some zip. So we are ambushed with "Surprise, Surprise" (!) Nominated at the Oscar. Well, surprise, surprise, the song smells, so does the movie. Grade: D
