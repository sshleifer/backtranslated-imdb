As a "Jane Eyre" fan, I was excited when this movie came out. "Finally, I thought someone would make this book a movie that follows the story written by the author." Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to throw a "Jane", it was clear that he certainly did. However, he certainly could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the frightening suspense of the novel when the laughter floated on the seeming night from nowhere? Where was the spark of the child who was flirting and dancing like her mother? Finally, why did the plot change at the end? He wonders if the screenwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
