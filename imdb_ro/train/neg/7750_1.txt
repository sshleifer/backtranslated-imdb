This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half the movie is animated, the death sucks, and, above all, I was ready to suck the people who made this movie! DO NOT REPLY HOURS OF YOUR LIFE VISIT THIS MOVIE. The only good part was when the movie ******* is over! This film is 50% Jurassic Park, .1% Sabretooth, and 49.9% DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you will regret it. Do you want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cover was sucked, the graphics were sucked, the blood looked (I mean) ketchup, people tried to blow up, college students think there's everything they can and can get up to the animal. I mean, there was a 5 ft tiger running straight to a woman, throwing a spear at her from 100 meters! READ AS YOU HAVE ADJUSTED! The actor was also horrible. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and it had to go and ruin it.
