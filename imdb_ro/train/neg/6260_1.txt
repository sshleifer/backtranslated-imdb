Bathebo, you're very big. This is the biggest piece of shit I have seen for a long time. I just hit it on TV late at night and it's painful to watch. Very painful. How is something like this done? Horrible, horrible, horrible! OOOOOO ..... The toilet is self-washing again! Scared toilet! Scared toilet! Scared toilet! 1992 does not seem so much to me, but that looks like 1952. I mean her horrible. Please do not waste your time with an enemy! The frightened scary black man tells them not to build the pool in the yard. Frightening! Frightening! How are these things done?
