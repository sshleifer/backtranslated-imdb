Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... honestly I have to say that I was totally disappointed in this whole series ("He does not die", "Mermaid in a slot" and "Flower of the flesh and blood" being the exceptions ... and even those that are not great in any way ...), but "The Devil's Experiment" just blows badly. There is nothing realistic about going here, other than the climatic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you see it) the scene of the piercing of the eye. The victim does not seem to care about what is happening, and only if the baby or the whimpers are subjected to "hideous" tortures (more often "hilarious"). The "meat and blood flower" is a more violent and violent representation of fake "cigarette" material, but the film also collapses realistically. I applaud the Japanese to push the limits and have gone a long way over the past two decades to wear the crown in the "extreme" movie, but "The Devil's Experiment" just does not stop. You should watch if you're a bastard, if for no other reason than to see what it is, but I can give this film only 3/10 extremely generous and just for that scene ...
