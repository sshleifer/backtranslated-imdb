There is really little need to start this little review with a synopsis plot. I mean, Shakespeare's Hamlet for the good of love? probably one of the most famous songs ever written. Do not I bother to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet as more people have on IMDb? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show may not be the best place to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch this movie without the comic comedy. In a word, this German version, made for Hamlet television, is disturbing. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours. I said many times, but the entertainment is for me. And this handle of the hand is far from fun. However, I will give some points for what I felt was quite good action. A 3/10 sounds about the right to me. How much I like MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more tasty. There are some good riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is just a wrong film for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flux. As much as it hurts, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
