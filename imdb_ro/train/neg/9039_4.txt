A noble effort, I think, but eventually a poor one. Before watching this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, the Scrivener" was unfathomable. After I see it, I do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and will be upset with the useless revisions of the film (updating from 1850 to 1970, passing from New York to London). Even the splendid talents of Paul Scofield can not save what seems to me to be a well-understood, but mistaken effort to film Melville's classic metaphysics.
