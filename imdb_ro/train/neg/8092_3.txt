Tom Wolfe, the brilliant novel, remarkably noticed by the satiric life of the New York snobbery, has a glossy glance here, but still not well served. The film does not suffer only because of the demeaning of Tom Hanks man as a Yuppie lie, Kewpie doll, Melanie Griffith, as a Belgian manipulator in the south and Bruce Willis (?!) As a dear to New York literature. The worst misstatement was in the director's seat. Robert Altman could have inspired life in these inappropriate characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual sophistication, has never looked at the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but seems blah to its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not make the spectator angry, what is the reason?
