Unlike two other current shows from Endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs 100), the rhythm in this show is too slow for what's on the screen. DOND and 1 vs. 100 can escape at a slow pace, as games can change in pace - or at the end - at any time. There are risks in every action the player has, the rewards are very variable and it is difficult for players to leave with a significant amount of money. Suspension is usually put to use. <br /> <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, it's just too slow-paced. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that nothing is going to happen in the next few minutes. This would greatly help the rhythm of this show to reveal the correct FIRST answer, and then select a dancer instead of Shat losing time talking about what will happen if the player gets the wrong answer when we all know they are right. Random dance is stuffing that actually feels like stuffing. Too much time is wasted while it does not happen enough ... and the fact that players can not choose to give up the game guarantees early that there will be a lot of lost time. Oh, and I do not have the interest to watch Shat shake, especially as soon as I ate dinner. I'm a fan of the show all along life, but even I had a lot of trouble standing in an hour of this. It takes either major changes or early retirement.
