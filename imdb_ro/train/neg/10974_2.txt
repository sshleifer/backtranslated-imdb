I'm Irish and lived for a while in Denmark, so I was expecting to go home last week to see the ban. And I will stand by saying: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS AWFUL. It's not such a bad thing as "the most fertile man in Ireland," but he definitely does not stay there with other Irish films such as Commitments, I've come down or Michael Collins. Some aspects of the movie are actually quite funny, like Colm Meaneys in American style. But the movie itself is completely shot wrong. The zoom around the camera and the zoom-in constantly, the zoom-out attempts to give the film a crazy look as if it were a tough drama. But it is not. This is an Irish Lock button, Stock and two barrels of smoking and should be shot that way. It should have a slight movement from one photograph to another. The film looks only negligent and thrown together. Performances are good, given the terrible scenario. A friend of mine told me that he seemed to have followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. He offers a decent poster like Dublin Dirtbag, but does not compare to his performance in the Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best interpretation was made by Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a frustrated middle-aged woman who was just taken by her husband's manager for a younger woman. I think she should leave her stubborn master and focus more on her acting. On the whole, it does not make life at all to the expectations of the Irish press or deserves to be considered one of the best Irish films ever. I expect a response to these comments, because most of the people I said said it was great. But, before answering, ask yourself: Would you think so much about this film if it had been established in England or America?
