I should have admitted that the drawing of this film is director Eduardo Sanchez, who has organized the popular and successful Blair Witch projects. Besides, this is an extraterrestrial movie, and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies critics hated, but I liked it. But, unfortunately, I felt that for most parties, Altered is a waste of time, so I will keep this brief review. The premises are always promising, and Altered is no different. She tells of a group of people who encountered strange encounters when they were younger and, as usual, others will take you like something that imagines something. Stories about extraterrestrial kidnapping have to always face the wells in the holes, so I will not get into the details, but you will get the drift, which is uncomfortable and something you would like to forget. What happens if you get a chance of revenge? I mean, you can hunt successfully and catch one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a joyous time, so they believed. And this is where the film begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad dialogue, uninspired, and even worse. Even if it is low budget, there are not many redemptive factors, whether it's the power of story or any help from distribution, to make their characters just an interesting thing. It's the standard carton tariff in a simple vanilla scenario, coupled with some cheap scared employee tactics. Which is good, though it is makeup. Much has been done to do some of the things I will not mention, because that will only hurt a few elements of what makes this film tolerable. Besides, there are the usual special effects of cheap, blood and gorilla moments, which is nothing you have not seen before. Just follow this as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in the city - Feast, it's less fun and takes it seriously. Rich down from an uninspired direction, you were warned.
