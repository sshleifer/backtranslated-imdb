I saw the sign when I was 11 on television. I liked the Trilogy. So when there was a chance I could see someone at the cinema, I could not give it. I went to the cinema knowing that what was about to be seen was not a cinematic release, it was a movie shot for television. However, being a fan, I could not resist. But this Omen movie I saw at a midnight examination did not bring chills, it brought laughter. The risible dialogue, such as "It is written that if a child calls during baptism, he rejects the god there." What nonsense.No decent pieces. Faye Grant so good in V is wasted with this scenario in hell. Do not mind and do not have fun. However, we laughed out loud a few times to our evil was. Really Pathetic1 out of 10
