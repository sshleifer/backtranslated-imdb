When I first started in the news this morning, I thought, "Finally, I have some entertainment." It's been funny for a week ... But we have to deal with it, these news reporters (if you can even tell that) have a long time around. First of all, I thought Jillian was a fresh air. But, seriously, this woman did not even have a journalist in it. It's very unprofessional. He continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform viewers of a particular news report. It's just annoying to the point where they can not follow. Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, he's a celebrity who likes to be a celebrity. That's why she's instantly turning into a celebrity around the celebrities she was supposed to interview. She is not very professional and she can perceive her relationship with celebrities more important than being an unjust journalist - and that's all I can say about her. Also (disappointing), this show has more news about entertainment than necessary news stories about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and / or serve the public. They focus too much on sensationalism that everything that is spoken becomes a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interested in tolerance ... I think "Good Day LA" is for teenage teenagers and celebrities, and certainly not for people who actually about the news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would prefer to look at KTLA, but they try so hard to have fun sometimes, I'm still a bit bored, okay, I'll stay at NBC "Today." "Hi Morning America "of ABC is also fine ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not get too serious.)
