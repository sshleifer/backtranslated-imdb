This film is a good example of the extreme lack of writers and good directors at Hollywood. The fact that people have been paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. The idea that the public pays to see this movie (and as an idiot that I hired the movie) is also discouraging. The obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills the adolescent's family because he wants it. For no reason kills the mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the evil of action and direction. Years later, the obsessed teacher bursts out of prison. HMM - the usual evil writing - no one in the town he's terrorizing knows until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow gets like a SEAL marina and can sneak around, smiff people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now, the obsessed teacher kills the hotel maids, without any reason, baptism blades for fun, and starts hunting adolescent friends. Now is the perfect way to make your girl love you. An obsessed teacher sneaks out of the hotel --- again, it's stupid, a policeman would ever know his face - but he goes by them. Now she kills two cops outside the teen's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. There is no positive thing about this garbage. If any other profession is going to take a job of this low quality, they will be fired. However, these idiots make hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and drive this garbage.
