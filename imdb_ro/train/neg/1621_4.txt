"Fox and the Child" is the new film of French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary "March of the Penguins". It focuses around a young girl (marvelously played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her flourishing friendship with a fox. There are some really fascinating moments here; the screaming nuns, a laughing out the fox through a forest full of snow; a scene especially when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times. However, it simply is not much. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shot; cinema is dazzling. The blond appearance of the movie is great. It is undoubtedly a very lush production. The English version is reported by Kate Winslet, but what's already there is very bad. The score is also too fluffy, or at least it's for my taste; and the script, while subtly, jumps apparently from one scenario to another, eventually leaving me almost confused. While there is a beautiful morality in the heart of the movie, and the quite quiet performance of Noël-Bruneau is pretty awesome, the real star is the fox. Those captivating moments that focus exclusively on our little friend are extraordinary. However, again, it simply is not enough. <br /> <br /> - To keep up to date with the latest movies, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray. com.au
