Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic dwindling / expanding machine to the Smithsonian because he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) are preparing for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall) . Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and her children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are gone. the title would lead you to expect), adults are accidentally punctured by Wayne's low radius. As the children begin to go amok, their thumbnails have to deal with big monstrosity insects with carpet wrinkles that look like canyons and other threats for them. This was bad, as if most of the films are straightforward, dear, we dropped. I had to laugh at the fact that the movie "roach" Stuart Pankin and the party partisans were even more ridiculous, see at your own risk!
