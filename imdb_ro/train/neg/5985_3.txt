This movie is just a child against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just a hook that makes people see it, but they are almost accidental in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just one step to attracting the audience. It was interesting to see what movies you see about the future of London will be and how the world fits together. The best part of this film is some of the lines delivered by Lady Penelope who are very comic. They offered a slight relief to those waiting for a restart of the TV series. After saying that it's over 90 minutes in a "fun" way and so it could only be worth watching.
