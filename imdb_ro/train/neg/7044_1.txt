How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still seemed suitable and attractive, but for some reason she seems to be really frightened. I understand his fear; fearing that this third rhythm would be somewhat at the disposal of the general public. I am also a fan of love Adam West. Again, as in Tina, Adam looks good and in excellent shape for a man of his age. Its action here is acceptable, but the scenario is so bad that it is difficult to listen to the dialogue. The film is a rip-off of the classic biking movie Brando, The Wild Ones; out-law biker band is out-of-control in a small-hick city. The motorcyclists here look like a motley group and I sure would not want to meet my sister. The act is rigid and wooden, and the story is as old as the sand. Hellriders is hell to watch!
