Where to start from? The terrible action? The absurd plan? The effects of the bargain basement? The completely disgusting characters? Edit edited? Something that induces Casio's keyboard score ??? The racist embarrassing comments ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Back off, Jackie Chan!" "The constant misogynist" I am a fan of horror throughout my life and I have no problem with the current "torture." The trend of movies is, "I think I have suffered more pain in this regard than the characters who died in it!" If you like the girls to have to eat the fried penis, very poor soft porn base and lines of thought how it would be "I will find that b **** and her cap has closed!" are intelligent, FEED LIVE is for you., I feel the need to wash my eyes with the cleaner to prevent ever seeing this movie again!
