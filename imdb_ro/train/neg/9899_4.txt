The ridiculous cinematic version of the classical literary film "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with pastor's daughter Joan Bennett. Derek's brother is a rival to Mrs. Bennett's affections. When Mr Barrymore loses his leg in a whale accident, Bennett rejects him. He has to kill the dragon and win Bennett back ... There are several scenes that might be excited by the theater audience of 1930; especially scenes where Barrymore loses his leg. Still, the film did not age well; there are much better movies from that time, both the 1920s and the 1930s. The two sights of the name, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett, are not the best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
