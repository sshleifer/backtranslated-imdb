Make your mind. Personally, I found it as fun as receiving a Stewart Wonder vertebral valve. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I just found it bad. Not exactly the first two choices for childcare; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drinkers to prevent prison, are trained to guide two children from a Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) development center. One of these is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth-grade student, and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a young bashful playing in a fantastic medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperate to give their accusations an invaluable view of life, love, and heavy metals. Lynch is hilarious with her dry analogies. Supporters are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
