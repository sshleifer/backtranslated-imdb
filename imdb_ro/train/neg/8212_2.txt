I have read all the comments about this movie. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this film was based. The film is an ugly and ridiculous fictionalization of the truth. Do not criticize it because it changes details or small events for dramatic purposes; it's not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, the reaction, the realities and the changes in the main character EVOLUTIONS. It greatly changes the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry of a Tibetan woman (who distorts the culture of Tibet) with Harra's gift for music, with Harrar's heart change, everything about this film is fake - > for stunning photography. I understand that the pictures of Potala (the palace) have been gilded from Tibet. However, changing a real story about the relationship between two people, one of them very important to this world, to build a movie star is sad
