Shame really - I rarely watch a movie and I felt disappointed at the end. I've seen some of Ira Levin's adaptations - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Wives Stepford" - and they liked both, but that did not appeal to me. When I read (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and to operate his screenplay for his own success - I was very excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. I will not hurt her for any person who has not seen it yet, but I am told there are LOADS of overturning and transformation. So much hard to explain in detail the plot of the film without giving them away. I liked the first ... 45 minutes before the beginning came back and at that moment the interest and the joy began to disappear. Although I must give Lumet the credit for the very funny end that made me laugh aloud. The main scenario - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Although Worth's obviously fake Russian accent moves slightly on my nerves (nothing personal Irene, I think the fake accent of an actor will irritate me). I'm not sure if Cannon's character should have been annoying funny, but Dyan managed to get angry and amuse - at the same time. Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to stop watching this because for me - give it a chance, you can, you can not. It's about opinion.
