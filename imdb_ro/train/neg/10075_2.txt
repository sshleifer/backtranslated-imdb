I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed failed to save this sequel. I went through half of the movie, thinking that this was a spoof of the original. Then came that wild and tired motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only film that Patricia Birch is leading); and I realized they were trying to be serious. I got a shot at the fact that the opposite band, after having lost their "wheels" due to their playing habits in the original Grease, was forced to use motorcycles in the second film. Being ashamed of that mocking character, Carrington, I'd love to see what he would later appeal to: maybe motoped? I never bought the unclarified theme: mad-australian-boy-not-fit-in-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-go-for-tough-guy-stupid-biker-casca-look. Disney's story has gone great. Therefore, it seems that you can destroy a good thing by placing a bubble gum and leaving Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I got from this movie was an idea of ​​how many points out of ten to give.
