Plot: A lovable couple decides to engage in some extra-marital robberies in a brilliant car. Then they are (literally) locked in a compromising position, while the car wanders miserably on the landscape until the unhappy couple is rescued by the authorities. This is. That's all the movie. There may have been a dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious so far that this film is not only useless but also physically painful to watch. The fact that he played two of the best actors in the UK (one of whom is now unfortunately dead) adds to horror. Ian Charleson was remarkable in Oscar-winning "Chariots of Fire". Let us remember this role and try hard to pretend that this celluloid abomination has never happened.
