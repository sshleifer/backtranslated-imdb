I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He went out with a handful of good movies, then descended in bad stories, dishonest work on the camera and a lively person, almost lost me. A few films ago remembered how to make a decent film. Now he forgot again. This movie is very dark (at any level you want to call it). There is a lot of slash & gash happening here with no discernable purpose, unless it is meant as a warning against the army. Seagall could have had a stand-in for many of his scenes, as it was often too dark to say and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad guy who murdered the guard to escape custody and then continued to raise chaos everywhere. Okay, since we put a guy armed in a room with a prisoner? However, this bad guy was at least colorful and highly focused. There's a lot of gore if you like this king. It seemed to me that bad boys had broken the same buzz every time. I'm glad they did not suck the blood from their unhappy victims. I called you back to my summary. Basically, it's a horror movie disguised as an action movie. By 62006
