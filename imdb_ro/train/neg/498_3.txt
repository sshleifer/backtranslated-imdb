I saw this movie when I was younger and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week and you can guess the result. Some funny parts in it, very few and too long. Beginning is the only thing that's funny if you ask me. If you want a total b-movie, this is a good choice, but do not expect too much from the dwarf size aliens
