Although this movie was made before Dogme appeared as the predominant shooting method, and before the digital triumph landed on it. You got it. This masterpiece of 1991 has clearly anticipated these developments. Corin Nemec is just remarkable because the author and the narrator do not behave well. The rhythm is slow but elegant, because the cinema is so beautiful. Record it next time on Tv, because I guarantee you will never see a better film for nostalgia. Direct-to-video has never felt so good!
