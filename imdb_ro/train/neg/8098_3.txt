This is one of the most atrocious rewriting ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a bad story, they should refrain from giving a title to a good book. There is not really a relationship between Wolfe's book and this film other than the title. I do not mind changes if it helps a story stream on the screen. At least the changes should not affect the end product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. Actors are mistakes. The director-writer and / or a screen obviously could not decide whether to make a lazy comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you have seen this movie and displaced it, try the book. If you saw this movie and enjoy it, read the book.
