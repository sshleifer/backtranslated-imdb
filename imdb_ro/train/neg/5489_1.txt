The story is similar to ET: an alien escape on the ground and tries to return home. While staying on our planet, it will create friendly relationships with people. But unlike ET that emanates drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It is really a pure Dysney production: its main audience are children and the film is more in visual than in the message. So you'll find some funny scenes (the first view of the city, a "cosmic" toaster, and the casting is experienced, with special mention at "Doc", which features a Mac Fly character and Hurley character, auto-derision. /> Ice on the cake: the main title is Danny Elfman, and like any other great composer, you recognize the "voice" before it's even credited.
