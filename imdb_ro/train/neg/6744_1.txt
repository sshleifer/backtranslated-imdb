As you all know, JIGSAW did not make his way to Blackbuster because of a Full Moon member of his own staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells all the video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he had sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take any JIGSAW and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED looks like a shot. The big problem is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever and, as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge you all to go to BLEED on the internet and vote for the movie that hurt JIGSAW and all your talents. You should also go to the JIGSAW page and give high votes for it (if you have not already done so). We have to get to JIGSAW up to at least 8 or 8.5 and BLEED to be around 2 (placing it on the list of the 100 worst movies on the internet). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> We hope you all do well, - Matt
