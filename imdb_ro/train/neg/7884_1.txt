Things I learned from "The List". A decent cinematographer, a hot girl who can act and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie from sucking. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won "I give you the money back. Even when reading the script and saying" Ugh! Really?! ", Malcom McDowell is still trying Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting. <br /> <br /> Hiring a writer Jesus hates me and punished me by paying me $ 5.50 to watch this movie. , you do not need an end, leave it all inexplicable, unresolved and sufficiently uninteresting, so the audience will fall asleep before the end.Genius.Any random owner can only cure death by drawing a cross on a window. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have fun with you if you bring this movie home. <br /> <br /> The calls will not be accepted.
