A confusing misery from beginning to end. Just as they used to say about the Beatles'ongs, there was a secret message if you played the LP back. If someone had the patience to watch these movie scenes from the beginning to the beginning, you would come out with the same disappointment. In addition to all these psychedelic piano piano pics and flashbacks, clearer characters were supporters of the film, out for revenge if the movie was not sorted. I had no reason to like both of them. Overacting, cries and threats have been broadcast in comic book modes. I think a dimensional one was an overestimation. Okay, maybe the guys artists twist their eyes, discovering that, unlike them, we just did not make pleases. I'm afraid there was nothing to understand. And the two cardinal sins of any bad film worn from beginning to end. A line of non-existent and pathetic story, if you want to say that, and by far the worst, no single character who cared for you at least.
