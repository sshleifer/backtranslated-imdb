Bugs Bunny accidentally ends at the South Pole while trying to stay in Florida. Where he meets a small penquin he's trying to save from an eschimos. This short test and penquin is adorable, but ultimately it's a bit too easy in the laughing department. Eskimo is not really that great for a Bugs foil and I've just seen a lot better cartoons with Bugs Bunny, even some other shorts when it's associated with other unfamiliar antagonists. So, I can not recommend this in good conscience. However, it is nice to see it in its uncut form. This cartoon is on Disc 3 of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My degree: C
