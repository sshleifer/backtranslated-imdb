The annoying mouse and song really came to me and they had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I'd done my first year at the film school. Very sad. In addition, the story seemed to shoot for no apparent reason ... there were too many things thrown there that had nothing to do with the story, which made me feel that the crew did not really know what they were or just that it should have been shorter ... what would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I just watched all the episodes so far this week ... I would have to say that this was the worst thing and I just wanted to warn others not to start with it.
