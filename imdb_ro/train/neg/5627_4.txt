As I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how far the blacks marginalize them. The film spends time demonstrating how powerless the most visible black is in it (except for a heroic moment). For much of the film, the other black men (and black women with dark skin) in the film are in the background, barely visible. The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and sympathetic. The visitor can easily identify and sympathize with it. There are also some pretty visible and three-dimensional support characters that are open-ended, and some white characters of a certain warmth and dignity. But 99% of the black men in this movie are just invisible men. It shades without a voice in the background without consequences. Such a horrible flaw, but something unusual in the media.
