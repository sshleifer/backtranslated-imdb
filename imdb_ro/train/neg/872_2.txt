First of all, I expected Caged Heat to be on the same line as Ilsa, The Wicked Warden. Well, I was wrong! Under no circumstances is the exploitation of this film, "chain chix" or "women in jail". Sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in jail, wearing btw (fairly comic) street clothes, but NEVER is happening. There are no strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the guard or the doctor to try to escape, and no detainees do. There are 2 shower scenes, which I suspect are just recycled materials, but there are no battles / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that! Apart from the lack of plot, unbelievable, insensitive, and flat, a couple of inmates who manage to escape, in fact, return to prison to "free up" their inmates? <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should have ended with escapes going west ... unlike letting this mess go on! I feel scammed.
