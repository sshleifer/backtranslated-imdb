Carl Panzram lived a wonderful life and pulled his memoirs out of pieces of paper for the eventual single person who ever made something altruistic for him. The book "Panzram: A Crime Journal" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which went out more than a century after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to a first generation of Americans to flee from their home to go west and be a cowboy, be caught, thrown into the boy's house, repeatedly escaped and thrown into prison from time to time to be tortured and sodomized. As Panzram became huge and powerful, he sought revenge for the harm done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it does not matter what he raped, robbed or killed because we are all the same of worthless. The film throws thin James Woods, the tough throat, the bully, the son of a bitch, Carl Panzram, who is "drunk" in the movie, too dramatic and emotional and never mentioning the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does nothing else especially about this world traveler and prisoner in career (such as robbing the former Taft chairman or getting out of Oregon prison for as long as he has given his word to come back). In short, I do not think Carl would be too happy.
