Someone had a great idea: allow Misty Mundae to make her own version of Rara Lara Croft, which burns two weapons, not only in outfits, but also in topless. It was really a great idea. The problem is that the people who had it could not come up with any scenario or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "film" that barely reaches a medium length by resuming several parts (often in slow motion) and it seems to have been shot entirely in a garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still evident: she is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty with the faces next to the door. However, the two co-stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian period, are not close to her league. If "Mummy Raider" was featured as a Youtube video, I would appreciate more, but as a "DVD" movie, it can not get more than 1/2 of * out of 4.
