I was enjoying Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones," my interest peaked, so I tried to stay in this second-round screw on an investigation into the death of a jockey - but I did not succeed at the end. Arthur, photographed in a modest revolution, wants to be fed by former husband William Powell or another marriage shot, but I did not feel it because the character is just a string of witches (she is the type of heroin prone to comic curiosity, but once in a morgue - like all the women in these 30 comedies - she fails). William Powell had a long time working with Miss Arthur, but you never knew him about the end result; he stared strangely, sitting side by side, hesitating on their banter. The actor who plays Powell's valet is tormented, and laughter for spectators laughs with anxiety.
