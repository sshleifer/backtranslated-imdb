I have seen every episode of this spin. I thought the first season was a decent effort, given the expectations of such success, which is Gray's Anatomy. So I kept watching. I'm afraid the second season does not have the charm, the chemistry and, more importantly, the drama of the anatomy of its predecessor Gray. Relationships seem to be controversial, and the act is so. Writing has no clue of intelligence and comedy seen in GA. There are performances that show a formality, but do not feel formal and controversial, unfortunately PP is not so. I liked Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is not just interesting.
