1 of 10. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you do not think you just wasting 2 hours of your life as you see the role of credits. I honestly believe I can make a better Vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. The only thing he does not suck (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee ... his character is at least a little cool, has some mystery and strikes a bit.
