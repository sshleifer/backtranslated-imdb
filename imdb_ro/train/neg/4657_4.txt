Remakes (and sequels) have been a basis for cinematography since the beginning of the press. It's pretty much a blow or miss risk, though. If you take what's good of the original and build on it and update your current key features, you can be successful. Note that such films, such as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005), have succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) do not succeed, miserable. BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the template for this movie. It is as perfect as it could be done on such a subject and we evaluate it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, found innocent by accident and tragically lost. Why, it only happened to the two (2) directors involved at the wrong time. They are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. No one is conducting the Star material conventionally, but it is a quality player. For details, watch the movie. Now, what happened? A T.V. film, practically remodeling the stage scene with actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN, should be at least marked IMDb ****** Six. Both actors seem to be disinterested, just throwing up their watches and picking up their checks. They are not involved with their characters or with each other. You do not think I am in Love or when it finally separates that it is a great loss for any of them. That should not be, and therefore fails in its intent. Sometimes it's better to leave things alone.
