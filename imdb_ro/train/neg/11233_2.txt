As far as I can tell you, despite previous comments posted by other commentators, this movie is currently available on DVD. We found it a few weeks ago. It's on the Value DVD tag and we've paid the total of 98 cents plus the fee for it. We found it at a 98-cent shop between plastic bowls and disposable sticks. Now, do you people who have escaped drinking pocket brothers for the super-duper Swedish import version limited edition feel like you had ??? I thought so. The film was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I could start arguing with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that you are saying about getting what you pay for. For the slasher film lingerie.
