This is a terrible disaster of a movie. From the beginning to the end, it is full of bad action and even worse editing. The only recovering parts of the movie are some numbers by Streisand, because Kristofferson plays are impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at the top or the character of Streisand struggling. The first one has to be seen in decline, and the second is growing. Streisand's latest number could have been one of the biggest movies in the movie, if it had been directed and edited correctly. The only frayed blow of his face during the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the wide pictures of the scene were shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This movie must have been directed and edited by a NYU film school. The only thing worse scenario can be miserable. The last musical number is the only redeeming part of this movie, and even this is completely upset by the wrong technical decisions.
