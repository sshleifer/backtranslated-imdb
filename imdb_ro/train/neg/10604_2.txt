This time, the hero of the first film has become a man, and this time he uses fist and foot combinations against super-universal soldiers and a computer that is wrong and ready to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing action movies. However, it has affected its credibility forever. While Universal Soldier: The return is not as boring as the Double Team or The Quest, it is still quite terrible indeed, with no style and flair of the original pair and no pair of stars. This continuation is simply for children who enjoy professional battles. As I look back, even the sequences of action were not so exciting, and therefore this movie is a useless dude. In other words, another clunker from Van Damme's assembly line. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
