I do not have to realize The Pallbearer, it's not too bad, but very slow in the past. As the movie continues, it becomes a little more interesting, but there is nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I do not mind sometimes, and she's okay. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like driving, then you can enjoy it.
