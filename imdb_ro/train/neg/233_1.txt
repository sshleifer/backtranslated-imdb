This movie is a calculated trial for the success of Sex in the City and four weddings and a funeral. In fact, if he called him Sex at a funeral, he could have done better at the box office. But the movie falls between two chairs and can not be lifted. Characters give an incredibly bright dialogue, but never act in the way of distance recognition as a human. An arbitrary, meaningless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and soon a fake tire of the entire enterprise. Andie MacDowell gets points to act on her little heart, but performance honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as actually a police detective (do they have a height requirement there?). Mrs. Staunton seems incapable of making a false move. We could say the same thing about the director-writer. If Notting Hill annoyed you as fake, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus half-shell.
