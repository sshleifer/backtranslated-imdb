This was a classic case of something that should not have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she did not live in a village with him (he was crazy that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Even there, I had problems with the series - I'm telling you, is it the same noble Michael Stivic who countered Archie Bunker's philosophies with straight wings? The series continued, but he had no pizzas. Regardless of the moment Sally Struthers won from the whole family, it has been a long time. Perhaps, if the series had received another name and would have been totally independent of All In The Family, it could have done it. Well, that's the show.
