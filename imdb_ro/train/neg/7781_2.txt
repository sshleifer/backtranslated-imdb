Strong boys, sexy women, many swears, and an unconvincing monster rising from the depth of the polluted lake. You would think that "Monster" would be fun ... but it is not. However, star star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, and in my book it is worth watching at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock directed the biggest part of the film, but Kenneth Hartford, who only directed the film with Andrea and Glenn's children (portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn , especially the inventive row) - received full credit. Considering how terrible the outcome was, Strock was probably glad he had not been credited! "Monster" has the appearance of a TV movie from mid to late seventies, which is why I like to leave it in the background so often. As far as entertainment is concerned, it collapses on the face, but as a reminder of another age and type of film that has disappeared, it is very effective. The only thing missing is tracking the car.
