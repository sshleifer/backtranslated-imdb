Rob Schneider is a famous comical cause of his movements, facials, and performance of "no people". This time he's the Animals. Marvin is a loser trying to be a hero and one day nobody receives a call from an attacked man, so Marvin must take this case and save the attacker. But on the way to the crime scene, it collapses by car and gets damaged. He does not remember what happens to the next ordinary day, his life is not the same when he learns he has instincts of animals. Of course, we received the woman that our main character tries to touch, but her attempts are useless. She is interpreted by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin needs to know how to become a normal human being again. By the way, his animal instinct helps him in certain situations. Schneider's performance is so. The movie is so unreal that it gets stupid at some moments, but it's one of those movies, called mindless fun as I wrote above. So watch it for Rob Schneider's monkey style, but it's certainly not one of the best comedies ever, or one of Schneider's best movies. He's a great comedian, but this is not his best movie.
