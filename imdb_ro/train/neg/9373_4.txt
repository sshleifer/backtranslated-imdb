Martin Kosleck's particular charisma brings some credibility to his frustrated artist. He combines his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to see as a real person and not so much a typical film character B. The story line is nothing to write about home and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. The character and philosophical character of Kosleck is in contrast to Hatton's key approach, monosillabical. The character of Creeper is not developed much beyond a basic monster level, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about the story behind. This movie was very much on Shock Theater when I was a kid, so I have a certain nostalgic love for that. It's worth seeing once, anyway, for those who enjoy Forties horror movies.
