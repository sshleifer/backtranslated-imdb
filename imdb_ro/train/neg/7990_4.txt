"Anita and Me" is a drama about Britain's multiethnic growth, rather like "Bend it Like Beckham," or more closely, "East is East", with which it shares a 1970s. The tone is totally chirpic (despite The East is the energy of the East, and the result seems pretty thin and cute. In addition, the portrayal of the film's central relationship between an Asian girl and her white boyfriend is insufficiently profound for to justify how the film is structured around it, I'm also tired of movies in which the hero of years is a writer, this is often something the real writers have experienced, but hardly an element fresh in a fictional story. "The East Is East" was fun and sharp, "Anita and I" seems obvious and difficult in comparison.
