I loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read in our class many years ago. And I read it in every third and sixth grade class in the last 18 years of teaching. It's supposed to have been a movie in the past, but I've never been able to find it. My students and we were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book on the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the greatest hopes. As the movie continued, I became increasingly desperate. They broke it badly! I have never been so stubborn by a favorite book-to-film adaptation. I understand that movies can not stick to a book but they do not need to change things for their sake! Most, if not all, departures from the book were totally useless! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinion from the beginning and I just listened to my students discussing the movie. Well, not only me. Almost every one of them felt the same way - deceived by the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, showed aunt aunt like Chewbacca in the movie of star wars? Why was Calvin's hair not red? Why did she do the lady who does not have the right band for the "witch" that was such a smart game in her name? Basically, we asked - why did almost every detail change? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed of how wonderful this book is. I'm still waiting for the movie. It was a high in time in the broadest of the senses. I'll write to Peter Jackson and convince him to take charge!
