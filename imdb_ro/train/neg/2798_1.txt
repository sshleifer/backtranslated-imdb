This movie is bad. If you think of watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie and it takes about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school games have a better effect. The plot does not make any sense. The set was pretty blade and it was not even good to have fun. It was just boring and very bad! I looked at Starz, so I thought he had to be at least decent. The description of the mini sounded as if it were good. Your girlfriend kills for seemingly without reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch a horrible music video. The transitions between the scenes are very steep and someone puts only a ton of clips in a movie without even thinking about how to transitions them. It just cuts off from one scene to the next, without any smudges. A sort of random change from talking about how bad the movie is, explaining why the plot is stealing. The audio gets low at certain points, where you hardly hear it, then it sounds loud with the "horror screams" of homosexuals thrown into random locations of the movie. It's the same sound every time. This is currently the official worst movie I've ever seen <br /> Making: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Stories: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter: 1.000.000 / 10
