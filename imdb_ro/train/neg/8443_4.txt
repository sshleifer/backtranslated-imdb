Anna lives with her family in a new living unit right outside the city. She has been with her husband Sebastian for years, and I do not talk so much. During a working visit abroad, a female colleague suicides. Anna is deeply impressed by her death, even if she did not know her too much. No one seems to know why he took his own life. For the first time, Anna realizes she can be an unknown among your dearest ones. Anna does not mention the incident at home and begins to notice her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly begins to look at her own life. She wonders how she was touched so far by those close to her. (This is my translation of the summary of the text on the DVD cover. I hope you find it useful because this movie does not have an IMDb Plot summary yet.)
