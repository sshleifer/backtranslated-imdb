Scenarist Lisa Lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Is it really in business? If someone gave him another chance after this piece of nonsense, she is getting ready for the lucky one person's prize ever. This movie is a soul that does not end ... Never stop wondering what turns into movies ... and the fact that they have made this writer stand up? Seriously? I can write more shit than this in my sleep. OK, so how many lines should I type? I do not understand at all. I guess I do not understand why there should ever be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have a single word sentence. or even one-word response. I mean, c'mon? Thanks ... is this enough, in the end? This movie is worthless.
