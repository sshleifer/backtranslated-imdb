I have to admit I do not own much of New Mumbo jumbo. When people "change energy" I always wonder how much kJ is changed and how it can help solve the problem of global warming. When energy is "implemented" I always wonder how they managed to break the entropy laws and are still without Nobel prizes. When people feel how well instincts allow them to navigate perfectly through the complexity of life, I wonder how they can not do a simple thing like finding the station. But again, this is not the first film with plot holes, and most find them perfectly acceptable and fun. If it had happened to the Celestine Prophecy, I will not burn this movie, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems to be bored and can not understand what he should do right now. This results in many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s," as I tend to do when I talk about quantum physics with someone who knows what he's talking about and pretends to understand. the direction is uninspired as well. You may expect something more from the guy who did "What dreams can come", but hey, I assumed he was well paid for this job and adopted the attitude of a taxi driver in New York: It's your money, my friend, only one who seems to have fun is always a bad man JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. He not only has a job, he's one of the few actors in this movie that could have some wise cracks in this eternal and terrible of the boring New Age chatter.This film is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a terrible horror that seems not to be able to shut up.At the time it seems that the words are turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown into your head endlessly until it hurts. If you want to have a good time and you have to choose between this film and sticking the safety pins into the eyelids, take my advice: choose the one from follow .
