Horror movie ??? i cant think how bad was this movie, what the point of this movie ??? the movie of nearly 1h and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it, it's just lene walking around with this stupid look on her face after having an accident .... not much talk at all, not even actions at all .. I have to say this, the last 20 minutes I've done a little action .. and it was still stupid ....... and the end Oh, my God, I do not know where to start, it all ends with that Look, I do not understand you wrong Lena Headey, I think she is a great actress but I do not know what got into it to make this movie .. do not waste your time and watch because this movie does not have story, has no action, and it makes no difference ... not to mention how slow this movie is going and feels like you've been watching it forever.
