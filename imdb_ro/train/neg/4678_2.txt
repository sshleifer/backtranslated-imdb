This movie had some kicks of andrenaline, but it's an old story that just could not happen. Naval protocols could never destroy so much that a crew far less an XO could ever go so far against the Captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove any day if I want to see this plot. Sidenote - US Navy did not support this movie.
