Basically, I filmed the movie, but only to catch the watch that was about to happen. Telling you the truth was pretty boring for me and in some places it did not make sense. The only reason I watched this movie first was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! It's so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot. However, despite the fact how warm is CHACE, it really did not make for the movie. I think the plot is not that bad, but what really threw me was the fact that it was getting confused in every sentence. Is it hard to express your anger without saying the word F every time? Cussing was annoying, and all the shimmering movements of the room gave me a headache. Overall, although the plot was OK, I found that the film is boring and dramatic. That's why I cut in the scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyway, it's not worth renting unless you're a heavy cast of a casting member like me. Yes, the distribution was warm. Girls were HOT !!! But CHACE IS THE BEST!
