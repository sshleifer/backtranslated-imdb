Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic book Roald Dahl. Wes Anderson directs and respects the short book of the same name on the big screen in a feature film. While respecting what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, did, the film seemed lost in his intelligent spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing he is a talented man and if this was a bad movie, that would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, it's Anderson's first bad day in movie production, so I'm gonna leave it easy. I will admit that she had a good intelligence and a beautiful spirit for it, and the animation is enjoyable, but the movie is getting harder to get in, leaving the story behind and experiencing random happenings of random things. And the characters are good. Jason Schwartzman's voice of Mr. Fox's clever son (George Clooney), Ash, and especially hiring. The film does not do much to a level of terribility, but it certainly comes nearer as it goes. I'm sure Wes Anderson will return to the track with another amazing movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but now, sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a great disappointment.
