Another American Pie was pushed into our throat and this is the worst of all. It's not worth the name American Pie. She should have stopped at the "Wedding". This movie resembles a silly porn movie that hit him with American Pie on. When I looked at it, I felt like watching a different series. It does not fit at all like American Pie. He has different humor and is more rude and has more sexual scenes than other American Pie films. I never recommend him. In fact, I do not recommend any of the American Pie Presents. Just stick with the beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
