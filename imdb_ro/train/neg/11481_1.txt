If Ed Asner could help why other actors did not come in place of people going to the same church with the producers? And why the protagonist threw the wise wise man on the ground when he was never in danger. He forced the old man to mask the wounding of pride, and so the young man would feel guilty, leaving him with a long duration of disability. I think that's why the main character refuses money and why the old man makes him a dog even when volunteering for extra work. If the d-bag lover is a bad guy because he's loved from long distances, then why is a better soldier. She has good reasons to be jealous, good reason to remove her from her hometown and protector and to control the manipulating father. All the characters that are meant to be nice are not and everyone else is the "bad" lover. How did a wine broker and an iron worker meet anyway?
