About time they released this movie on DVD. I know some say that WB hastened the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls. But how can you speed up the release of a movie that has been in your 1976 catalog. I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie without a special feature without 5.1 DD sound. come on WB, you can do much better than that. The audio and video quality of this movie needs serious help. It seems that WB has not placed so much time and attention on this movie because it's a black film and my sales are good. It could have kept the CD, which, by the way the dose does not have all the songs that the original CD has. <br /> <br /> We recommend this DVD for purchase. Yeah, because it's a classic movie. But WB has to go to add something special. Take notes from other group movies, Five Heatbeats or Temptation if you could only see the performance and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this DVD.
