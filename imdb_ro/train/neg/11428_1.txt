Oh, my God ... The biggest thing I've ever seen - that's the main thought that came to my mind right after watching the movie. And I do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Though, maybe the idea was good, but the effect was miserable. In particular, I refer to the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, it destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was interpreted in an annoying and annoying manner. Each time it appears, it reminds you that you are watching a movie and destroying a spirit of the moment, then the whole movie, because most of the time you can see its silly faces with worse attempts to create emotion. TERRIBLE, do not waste your time.
