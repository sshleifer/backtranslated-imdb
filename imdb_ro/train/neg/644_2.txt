We asked every time why "I can not remake the glorious films that were just OK, instead of resuming those who were already wonderful, so I can only do better?" well with Prom Night remembered Jamie Lee Curtis's medium but entertaining, fun film, and even made LIGHT. It's a paint of the movie called "slasher," which clearly tries to attract young adolescents (there is no violence here, etc.), the knife in this slasher hit is blunt. The director spends so much time concentrating on trying to make the killer quite attractive to look somewhat creepy like anything else coming out of the window. The cast that includes Britney Snow (who was gorgeous in Hairspray) is trying his hardest stuff, but the material offers nothing but to put them and look scared. More annoying is how dead scenes are treated will hear the attack but will not see it). It also shows that the only place where the knife worked in this movie was in the editing suite, since the movie seems to have been mumbled (I guessed something from the frightful distance reached on the floor cutting so as not to scare children ) However, in pours money from Americans send this movie to number 1 at the box office! Slasher movies are a lot of fun, but in the case of Prom Nights made me want to download the original. I've seen OCs and Dawsons Creek worst episodes
