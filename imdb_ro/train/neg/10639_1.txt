Thought, ignorant, poorly conceived, career killing (where is Angela Jones talented now?), Deeply unhappy garbage. No wonder that Reb Braddock has not directed anything else since then - anyone who has the chance to make his first film on his own rules, relying on his own script, with Quentin Tarantino himself, and creating something like that THIS, anyone who feels that this is a story that deserves to be told to the world, does not deserve a second break. Under these circumstances, performance is good - actors do what they are told to do, and do it well. It just did not have to do it first. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
