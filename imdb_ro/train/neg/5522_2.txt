We searched for the right words to describe this movie. At first, I was inclined to simply go to more important issues because the film does not rise to a level that deserves to be commented on. Still, I stopped, puzzled how to describe such things and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "What can we say about such a movie?" Trash? No, no garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? No, it is not greenhouse gases, greenhouse gases help plants become big and healthy. Finally, I hit "Not Even Evil," a reworking of the phrase "It's Not Even Not Mistaken" sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is flawed and not even worthy of correction. Then Georgia: Not even bad.
