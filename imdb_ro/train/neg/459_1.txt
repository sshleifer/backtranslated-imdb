I was looking for a nice and simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. I can not write one good thing about it. First of all, the script is bad and not at all funny, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a laughing turtle. In my book, this is not funny, it's pathetic. Low budget effects (if they can even call them effects) with horrible cinema. In many places it feels almost like an indie shot without money. Action ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for some money that they agreed to participate in this? (looking at their recent film, it would seem like that). In spite of her costumes, Pamela shows her age and, as a whole, she does not meet so sexy, much less fun. the movie is not even in the category so bad-it's funny. It's bad, as if all the people involved were ill. Avoid.
