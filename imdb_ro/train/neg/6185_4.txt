My first review in 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers playing by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore the hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. The day after a day of exploration, they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and to find a rare artefact about Columbus's hidden treasures that are reported at the bottom of the reef. the bottom of the reef and thick after a whole day of diving find nothing. A few days later the two employees discovered that they were part of a major deadly plot in which they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a nucleus. The film also has a story about another person (the main character's brother) who is trying to handle things with his girlfriend, I think this part of the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very sex scene Steaming between the couple that is for me a complete loss and it was not necessary to be shown. However, apart from the fact that this film has good underwater photography and colors mix well and that is why it receives 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel by name only. None of the original actors or characters return, has an awesome plot, silly characters and a boring climax.
