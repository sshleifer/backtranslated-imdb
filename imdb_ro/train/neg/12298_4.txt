"Witchery" could be the most incoherent and scandalous horror movie in the 1980s, but fortunately it has some compensating qualities, such as the fantastic effects of gore, an extraordinary musical score, and some extraordinary choices. Sincerely, the script does not make a single jot, but Linda Blair (with an exploding hairstyle) portrays another girl possessed of evil powers, and David Hasselhof describes an ordinary photographer (who does not seem to be put) a film that has a constant bloody voodoo, closed lips, overturning bangs, vicious burns, and a giant but really terrible song. Eight people meet together on an abandoned holiday island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the dark history of the place; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, even if nobody seems to care about who the father is and where she is) considers the hotel reopening and the male female architect simply labeled for occasional sex. Are they forced to stay that night in the busy hotel and then, suddenly, the house before? an aging actress or something that always dresses in black? begins to take them out in different ways. Everything is in some way related to the intro sequence that shows that a woman accused of witchcraft jumps out of a window. However, the plot is certainly of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that began as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead". The atmosphere is sometimes disturbing, and the makeup effects are without a doubt the best element of the film. There is something extremely morbid and anxious if we look at a defenseless woman who hangs his head down through a chimney and expects to fry.
