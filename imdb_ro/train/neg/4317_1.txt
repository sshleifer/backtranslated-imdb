My husband and I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started well, but it was quickly unbelievable and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, except for the girl, Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and blades - especially Gideon, the angel. Also, without giving anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, it seems almost nonchalant. At first I thought it was "shock," but I realized it was just a terrible scenario. We love almost all Hallmark movies and their stories of heart heating, but this film does not rise to the chance to be one. There are so many good - do not waste time with this horrible movie.
