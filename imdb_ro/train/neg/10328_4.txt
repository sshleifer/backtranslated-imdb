I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and the action is bad. There have been many problems that could have been presented in a better way, such as the protest against homosexual marriage or finding the cemetery. The show can not be properly referred to as a comedy show because it lacks miserable humor. I should say that this show has failed to put the life of the Muslim community to some extent. So far the second season is worse than the first. I had my hopes for this show, but I was rather disappointed. However, I appreciate CBC for putting this concept in front of viewers. Anyway, I wish good luck for the future.
