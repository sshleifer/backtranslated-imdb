What happened? "Doubt" had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead collapses with a simplistic plot line that made me want to stop seeing. The only thing he had watched was the glory of Meryl Streep, which no DOUBT deserved the Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of the best performances, it has still given us a solid and sincere character for us that blossomed through the screen. However, even the brightness of a legend on the screen could not save this movie from the valley. From the boring beginning, who did not have the power or the punch - to the less convincing end, the film was really a disappointment - especially because it offered so much potential by promoting its trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot and ended up in a boring film that attracted too much time, too much talk and no action. In addition, the other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, he was not at all worth the Oscar. (Especially since they have completely dropped off performances like Will Smith in 7 Pounds). Amy Adams is not worth the appointment. Watching Amy Adams was like she looked like a cardboard box - as it was one of the sides and smooth. It would have been more logical to nominate her for a Razzie, because I'm sure it would have been victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but true interpretation, but the duration of her interpretation made me wonder if the Academy should have given her the nomination. In general, I think it's the most disappointing film since 2008. It was a mess of a movie with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the movie is Meryl Streep, which, although it offers amazing and solid performance, does not even make enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
