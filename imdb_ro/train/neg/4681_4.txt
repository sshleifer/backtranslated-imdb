We laughed. This scenario is so incredible that you are either CNN or sleeping. My father was a 30-year-old captain, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer, he asked once to order the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / day and (I'm sorry) on his desk. Of course, it was not a nuclear mission. For example, fire from the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give an exercise at that time is just the Hollywood script. When a captain is arrested, he is in custody, take all the keys, and open the vault where the weapons are held. It is stored within minutes in a well-kept room. He can not escape, it's just like in jail. Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, but we see how Hackman let him touch the control room. This is never done. My father cleansed all the dirt the dog did anywhere. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars to which this film is credited, the rest being bulls **. > When we know that 23 people were still alive Koersk, this film has an extra dimension. If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
