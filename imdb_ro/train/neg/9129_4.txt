There is no confusion ... this movie is terrible. I've seen Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu's old films, I'm familiar with the characters and the serial, but it's just cursed. However, Peter Sellers's genius continues to shine through portraying Nayland Smith with echoes of sadness, tragedy and power flowing through a stoic fa√ßade; is a show I'm putting in parallel with Peter Cushing's Van Helsing portrait, but made it a tenth of the cumulative screen of all Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film was made in a more serio-comical vein like BUBBA HO-TEP via AVENGERS TV show in the 1960s, this could have been something special. If you are a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers complete, this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for anyone else.
