A very tired Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary struggling with his former employers for some twins whom these non-heroes intend to sell to the "Iranians." A video nonsense from "Silk Stalkings" producers offers some decent action images and a series of unprecedented "dramas" ... a lack of logic and a really horrible dialogue are the defining aspects, although final upheavals and changes of faith would could have been a wonderful ending for a better movie. Burt still has the presence, though it also means that you notice more when he mouths insulting half-baked "one-liners".
