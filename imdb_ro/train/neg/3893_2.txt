I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the worst case of running (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) could always have more film work after being reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job like Blob. The premise of this film is quite blatant. An astronaut becomes exposed to solar radiation (I think), and so begins to behave like a frozen cone on a hot day. Not only is he a puzzler, but he seems to have to kill people and consume their meat so they can maintain some sort of cellular integrity. It is not like that? Have you ever noticed that whenever a radiation accident or an experiment occurs, does the person instantly turn into a killing machine? Why is this? The astronaut is cut off the night from the "secret facility" (who has no safety), throwing parts of him as he goes. He seems to have enough memory to make him head to the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to go back to space. <br /> <br /> So start a part of the movie that is pretty much filled with a doctor wandering with a Geiger counter, trying to find the man who drowned with the noise he gives up. He kills a poor fisherman Bill Gates, frightens a little girl to the Frankenstein monster movie and ends up with an older couple louder (punishing him karmic for the theft of some lemons). Then there is a short scene in which he releases his former general and a very long scene in which he kills a young woman and follows his girlfriend. You would think that after cutting off his arm and running away, the scene will change. But not ... we are treated about ten minutes later by the woman crammed in a corner that shines and scream with terror, even if the monster has disappeared. All I could think of was the director's friend, whoever? The end of the film is even more lazy than the rest. The melting man ends up in a heap of goo and then ... nothing. That's it. This is the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no room for a sequel.
