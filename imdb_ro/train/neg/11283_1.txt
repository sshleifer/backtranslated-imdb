I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a total loss of two hours, the plot line was thin and confused, the prestigious line of players had a terrible dialogue and extremely controversial accents. The camera's work was somewhat experimental in place, and although he might see what the director was trying to say, it made it even more difficult to look. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narration throughout the film, as if the whole plot is dictated to the audience. The best performances were not related to acting. In fact, perhaps the most convincing show came from Dani Behr from all people, although, of course, it plays the stereotype of the office secretary. DO NOT under any circumstances go and see this movie if you do not need a reason to get caught out of your lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard-earned money.
