I like zombie movies and I like amateur productions. And the meat market 2 is really promising, paying tribute to Fulci's classic Zombi. So I bent over and waited to be impressed. Okay, some makeup is great for such a budget movie and some actors (vampire and chef) are really different, but there is nothing else. I did not expect a new Romero here, but there is no sequence in the whole movie that has even a little suspense or shock value. The director knows how to interpret interesting troops and food habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn a little more. In MeatMarket2 Gore rims with ribbon - it's not enough for me - I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
