"Freddy's Dead" has done the smartest thing he could have done after the disappointment of his fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie in the saga is stupid, but at least original. Some of the pictures are just a bit of breathing. And the story of Freddy's child (Lisa Zane) who returns to town to face his evil father is unique. Generally, the film is nothing but a different cartoon made to make children in the theater. She has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who actually look stupid and wander around sheep ready for slaughter. It is unilateral, it is a magical trick and, ultimately, it is nothing but childhood entertainment. <br /> <br />
