It's not too much to get excited about Dan in real life. First, the whole configuration is incredibly controversial. Do you really think that during this very long meeting at the restaurant, Marie would not tell Dan where she goes? And since Dan spoke in all this conversation, why would he be so attracted to him? Because I did not realize why Marie was so attracted to Dan during the movie. He is very narcissistic and does not really convince him that he is really a good guy (for example, he is at Marie in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past friends and tries to make Marie jealous with a "blind encounter "). There are more challenges, such as the ridiculous scene in the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are captured as part of the whole family. Yeah, that's how it could be. Dan in real life is slow-paced, sappy and manipulative. Even chicken films such as Jane Austen Book Club get higher grades than this tearjerker predictor.
