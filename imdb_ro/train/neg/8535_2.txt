As I said, the book was pretty good and it could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert had not been so horrible and unbelievable in her lead role. What was the point of supposing it is anyway? It sounded just like the horrible accent of Russia in another movie I saw in it. Every time he opened his mouth, I cracked. Three trials were needed before they could watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked beach scene scenes. They added a great glow to take your mind off Melissa Gilberts, depressed. I think they could have used San Francisco's vision more to their advantage. It seems that night scenes were actually SF, but I was wrong. I do not remember the character in the book depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent!
