If I asked how to define the word "Shallow," I would answer "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer Production." If I asked how I would define the phrase "scattered potential," I would respond to "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer Production." Bruckheimer's productions are almost always sure hits at the box office, but almost always receive critical pannings from critics. At the top of my head I can only think of an officer and a gentleman and a black man who enjoys a lot of critical gratitude. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE has also received criticism from critics, is certainly one of Bruckheimer's best films, which unfortunately does not say much. The problem we have is the scenario that creates the story: the Russians are fighting Chechens and the conflict is spread across Russia, leading an ultra-nationalist Russian to take over a nuclear nuclear base and threaten the West if it interferes. Perhaps the end of the Cold War had everything to do with him, but I found this very unconvincing. Is it not helped by some geography errors such as the French carrier Foch in Med (which would not have been better positioned in the Black Sea?) Or that the exhibition news network consists of familar pictures of conflicts in the Balkans, the first war in Golf and even Vietnam. Again, in my mind, the adjective "Very Unconvincing" broke out. The story is somewhat ameliorated when the story itself - a battle of the will on orders between a nuclear submarine commander and number two - is in full swing. Director Tony Scott does everything better than distribution, but the problem is still in an unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if this was done in the mid-1980s when WW3 was a real possibility - Nui Probability - this movie would be scared, but after the cold war ended, there was a danger of nuclear war, which means CRIMSON TIDE impact.
