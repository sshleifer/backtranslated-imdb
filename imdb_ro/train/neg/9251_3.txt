this film is, despite its "independent" status, a silly version of Hollywood's mother-daughter relationship. it was not so bad at first, but sometime during the movie - around the moment the little girl goes out with that guy, I think - it turns into a mating movie with my mother-daughter. I'm sorry but I do not know about mothers who have sex with their daughter ... but probably better in this way.
