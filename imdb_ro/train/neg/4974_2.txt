May the saints keep us, because this movie will not help. Someone with access must send Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern Western literature. Beowulf's recent (2000) versions ask us two things. First, why there is so much interest in the story. Secondly, why all these movie makers waste money on this stupidity. The only reason he got two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. What's worse, some people will follow this up and they will have a bad idea about poetry. How can an industry in which Peter Jackson becomes a literary conversation in such a fair movie that it can be so wrong. I mean, the Romanian Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. And please, horns on your headphones? Spare me. This is insulting. <br /> <br />
