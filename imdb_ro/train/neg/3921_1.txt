This short pass can be found on the Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of the "Living Dead Night" DVD. Okay, like I never would've seen him. Removing zombies with bread sounds like harmless paper fun. In execution, it is a different matter. This short did not even make me a chick. I never thought to say this, but "The Night of Dawn of Dawn of Daughter's Daughter Monster Revenge, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D" was a parody VERY MUCH and not as lame or boring.
