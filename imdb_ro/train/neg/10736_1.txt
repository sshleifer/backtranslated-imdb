The movie begins with an intriguing scene, three people drink and talk a little in a bar. They all make scandalous stories. As the movie unfolds, it seems the most outrageous story is true. However, beyond the fact that the movie is not very exciting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation only happens in half time in the movie and sincerely, there is not much to be seen. The director of the rest of the time is in a god abandoned by the Russian village, full of old ladies. Sure, these are fascinating and shocking paintings, but their admiration goes too long, sacrificing any possibility of plot or character development. I found my film as another example of such a bad or lazy movie where, instead of trying to make an interesting story, the filmmakers are focusing on fascinating strange images and some almost unrelated stories (the story of a meat retailer) to let the spectator realize all the chances and ends. On a surface it has an artistic appearance, but in this case there is nothing but a lack of talent.
