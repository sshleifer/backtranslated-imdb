I'm watching this movie right now on WTN, because it was the channel the TV was called when I turned it on. It's a very unreliable and boring story about the wife of a minister (Alexandra Paul) who falls in love with a young student (with abs washing) played by Corey Sevier. It might or may not be a plot. Corey whips her shirt off a crowd and Alexandra swoons. I have the feeling that she should not be good, and that is why she is tangled with poor Paul Alexandra. It's not very important because, as I said, she takes off her shirt very much and I just saw a glimpse of her head. There is a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
