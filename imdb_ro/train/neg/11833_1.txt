So, you do not even think about renting it out of the stores, because it's a bad movie. You think JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rat is washed in the toilet and somehow it has to go out again. Fans of the completely terrible "Shrek" might enjoy, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" will probably return in disgust. Also, why did not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For AARDMAN? !! Obviously, Aardman hurt while they let Dreamworks do everything. Wrong, wrong, WRONG !!! Almost every character is horrible, except for that kind of frenzy, which is just right for a villainous movie. But anything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with the boredom watching this movie. No, wait, in fact, I fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. It's terrible. But, fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
