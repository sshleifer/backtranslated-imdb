Frankly before watching this movie, I heard many people say this movie was a shame. I did not realize that Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took part in this film and watched it alone. Looks like they were right. I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell I watched this movie. Of course we did not expect too much from Justin because it really does not belong to the movie / theater Business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not wonder why they agreed to attend Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty bad. Well, you might think if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story. It's really the story is the core of a movie, but guys ... believe me ... it's not a movie you want to give it for its story. Imagine this, a journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was sustained by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). Finally, they beat the system with a happy story. Besides, I could not continue this. I just remember that the movie makes me sick already. I advise, do not look at it! Save money and time for another movie.
