I usually enjoy comedy movies. I like them very much. But I do not really have the idea of ​​"envy". That is, it has a boring content / subject and it's not even funny. Although the act is generally good, it is not enough for the movie to become at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show their talent in this movie. So if you're about to rent a comedy, I certainly suggest you're not going for that. Unless you want to get bored and see that I'm not the only one who has this opinion, because even Jack Black has apologized for that (take a look at Trivia).
