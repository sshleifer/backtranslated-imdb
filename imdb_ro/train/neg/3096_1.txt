For starters, "Hobgoblins" is trying to map the most successful "Gremlins". It's pretty bad, but it's not even trying to do something that looks like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a basement bargain, everything has to go to the yard of embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound FX, acting like an inappropriate tapioca, and a script that takes everything that people keep sacred in their pictures and throws them on the tube old -aroo. <br /> <br /> Parcel? Grrrr .... Children traveling in search of creatures resembling the gremlins in the film before killing people by designing their fantasy. It sounds cold, is not it? See the wall on the other side of your room? Flee to him at full speed, first with his face. See, it's colder than this movie. Do you dare to doubt yourself? Quickly, he calls something else, one of the rulers was in another. What other scripts did the Hobgoblins writers do? Name another directorial effort of Rick Sloane. How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have? See? Thank you. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I took so long to write about such a horrible movie. I prefer to write about more important things; such as separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" is and is bad - like your grandparents' wallpaper, bad like a pink flamingo on your lawn, bad like the underwear that says "Whopper House" ... and I think we'll stop there. Mike and the robots struggle with bravery but try how they can, I can do just so much with the Hobgoblins before they realize that yes, the director has to hit him in the tibia. br /> <br /> Real, very hard. <br /> <br /> A star for "Hobgoblins," seven stars for the MST3K version.
