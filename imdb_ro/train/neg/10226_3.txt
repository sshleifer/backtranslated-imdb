"Do not bother to watch this movie" would be better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in his other roles. This was a great disappointment in terms of big distribution, not just Marilyn. The story was nothing, of course, nothing like the one described in the VHS box, of course. There was simply no suspense, little precious enthusiasm and too many boring places, most of them trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so messy. This was not a good role for Monroe, although I did not need to see this character to know he could act. "Some Like It Hot" itself was quite good proof to me. But this role does not match her and it's no surprise it was not one of her more popular movies. Also, it's too bad that a movie lost the talents of actors such as Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not fun and entertainment is the name of the game.
