I was intrigued to see how a small movie seen in 2008 somehow won the Oscars for Best Picture in 2009 and so went to see The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, everything I received for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this movie won screen-exclusive prizes. The direction and visual style of this movie are some of the weakest you'll ever see. when it is not busy being another Bourne homage to an unusually "strange" noise, he shows all the distinctive signs of a second soap opera during the day in terms of filming. is the octopus, the characters are as well developed as the Beetle Bailey ideas rejected and the dialogue - in cases where the film drops to be "minimalist" and apparently makes one or two soldiers turn right into chat-boxes right - from the worst ever recorded. in fairness, actors do everything they can under these circumstances, not just enough to see how bad the project is. The whole movie has the feeling of being conceived as a kind of "mockumentary" they tattooed was humorous and thus re-edited as best as they could to pass it as a serious drama. If you spend two hours on this movie these are two hours you will not come back and you will miss two hours that you will regret for the rest of your life.
