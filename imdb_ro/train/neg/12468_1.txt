Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché at the cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems the director was not sure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is forced to kill an oil prince, is trapped and then warns the prince (why?)) And so some elements have been added to make the movie more interesting. So a child dies, which leads to the father's "natural" response: they freely advise the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around, why, nobody knows. Some children become suicidal terrorists and throw a ship into the air. <br /> <br /> All of these are one of the most serious movies I've seen for a long time. We were neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I did not laugh nor cry, I did not win a deal, nor did I have to learn more or get a case. It did not mean anything to me, which in my eyes is the worst you can say about a movie.
