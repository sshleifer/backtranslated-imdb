* INCLUDED SPOILS <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed," you know that creative juices were not broadcast at sea when this puppy was conceived. Movie is your basic movie for low budget movie. Sure, try to be creative with the premise of the "crime club," but we find it is a joke anyway. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that a new girl in town is starting to meet her colleague. He invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party they tell him how they have a "crime club" and kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we find it was a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now, Murder Club members are killed one by one. Oh, the bad guys win and the movie ends up on a downer. At that moment, you will not care. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes of this movie make no sense. The motivation for killing at the beginning of the movie is never explained. I would say it was a way for the director to take the film out, but there are deleted scenes on the DVD! I'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the "Bleed" version, but apparently the people behind the DVD believed the audience would have wanted to talk. On the box, it's said that there are Easter eggs, but why the hell I want to waste my time looking for an excerpt on this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I expected a bad movie, and "Bleed" delivered on this front. It was not a bad fun movie. Everyone looks good in the movie and there is a lot of nudity, but the act is just terrible. My least favored character is the guy who gets to be the killer ... I think it should be fun and fun, but it just ends up coming up as an instrument. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilarious, unconvincing death. Heroin pushes women into garment parking cement, and the woman shows that she does not touch anything, spits a mouthful of blood and "dies." <br /> <br /> For those who think that filming is a complicated, creative process by professionals, check "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will realize that any hack-get can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time or money on this.
