I like Vests. I could watch them all day. "Good, evil and ugly" is my favorite of all time. I saw Silverado probably for the 8th time, just the next day, because it was presented to CMT. However, this film, Shiloh Falls, is undoubtedly the worst West I've ever watched. The act was terrible everywhere. It does not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass looking for. The only good part I can think of is a beautiful girl in the canteen. The very clear long breaks between the dialogue seemed intentional only to make time to make the film with an acceptable length. This movie did not even deserve the new rental fee we paid for at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserved a rental refund if there was such a thing. Just the reason I finished was that I do not like not seeing a movie all the way. I halted it because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job if you decide to do another. This is the kind of film that has the potential to turn people into the West.
