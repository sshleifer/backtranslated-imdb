There are exactly two good things to say about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous commentator): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek is extraordinary, beauty inspired by poetry. She has photos in this movie, where she even gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's really a great compliment. Her nudity is short and discreet, but only her face is sufficient. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek setting of the island, its sun and blue crystal waters. <br /> <br /> Other than there is no story, the dialogue is lax and sometimes unintentionally funny ("She touched you where you are from!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a villain. Bo overlaps the naivety of her character, but again, when you have to work with the dialogue, it is badly unfair to accuse the actors (the fact that she continues to call the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently, everyone from there, from children to old people, speaks English all the time. (*)
