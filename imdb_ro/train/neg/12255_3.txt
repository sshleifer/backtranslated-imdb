... which is not even a call approval. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better film. Sure, in that film, Matt Borlenghi played a complete boring who spent the whole movie complaining about his little brother who was eaten by DinoCroc. But the special effects of "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the act was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a child model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. is wreaking havoc on a deserted island where they encounter a group of nasty native Filipino natives who are trying to force the women in the group. What was a complete 15-minute loss of film. And 3) there is not enough croc time. There are some redemption qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are quite attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the croc to the end of the movie. But if you are on the deathbed and you have enough time to watch a crocodile movie Matt Borlenghi / murderer, skip it and leave DinoCroc.
