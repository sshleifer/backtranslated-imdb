First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people who want to see something full of joy and pleasure for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a horrible mother who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost her job, loses her house, can not buy Christmas gifts for children, etc. You get the idea, happy things for holidays. So, Harry Dean Stanton comes as Gideon, the Christmas Angel, who, in his dark hat and long-haired coat, falls more like a pedophile, who piles up around the children all day, observing them. What better way to inspire the Christmas spirit in Maria Steenburgen than to kill her family and then bring them back if she thinks back to Christmas. Santa Claus is a blackmail and his Christmas shop looks more like a refuge for refugee Nazis. The film puts everything so thick you do not care about the happy ending when it comes, because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like Capra, but it left the joy and feeling of what should be a holiday movie.
