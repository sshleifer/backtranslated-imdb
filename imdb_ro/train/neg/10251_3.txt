A good business around. A badly conceived opponent with a very low complexity. A scientist working in communications that sends signals in space and receives them is caught by strangers. Together with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and gives them secrets about them. He becomes more traitor in this process. However, no choice is made at all. There's a scene where they give them everything they want. This is a boring movie with lots of long stretches where it happens a little. The land is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a trip through the woods, investigating a building. It's about editing. I suppose that the story would not technically support much more. Not too much here.
