Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the crowd of 20 years who is still trying to find their place in the world while obsessed with each neurosis. However, I can not imagine that the heavy amount of narcissist belly-gazing, banal humor, or banal topic would be hiring especially for anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, which movie makers obviously do not have than contempt for, are imminent until such absurd caricatures for the comic effect that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, you have to give some filmmaker style points, which obviously grew in video generation, and use every imaginary editing trick in the book for spruce up to an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to be held here. First, beware of the festival's dear ones. Secondly, even if we live in the age of YouTube, it is not the case for all people to think about their mundane life, it deserves great treatment. But these young directors have every right to make their own film, and if another 20 years can find something in it to identify themselves, then the better. However, I could not help, but I think at the end of this movie the way this last generation, just now comes of age, will do it in the real world, which presents so many challenges and complications. At the time when each child is constantly insured by the way they are special, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resilience and the ability to cope with adversity does not seem to be exactly the strength of this generation.
