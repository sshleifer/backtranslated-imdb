I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid, and I always remember it as my first experience in getting rid of a horrible movie with good communication. The trade was great, but later I found out that it had an explosion or a "special effect" in the whole movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the film. There was a kind of plot about foreigners, but strangers have never been featured in the movie as far as I remember. It was a case of someone who made a buck off a cheap movie meant to deceive people. I think my world of innocence ended that day when I found out there were bad people out there doing bad bad movies.
