A scene proves quite well the "Terminator Woman" mentality: Karen Sheperd and another woman try to escape the villain's camp. Karen crosses an armed guardsman that throws her gun on her, but after a few seconds she throws her and challenges her to a fight. Karen hits him in the balls, raises his gun and runs away! Then again, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you do not have to wait too long. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble arrived at the beginning of the year, and the movie would have proven better if it focused more on the relationship between love and hate. But after about 20 minutes they are separated, and the film slows down in a crawl and, even on the occasion of the occasional battle scene, to make life, it is devoid of enthusiasm. The end has Qissi from Trimble inside a cave, and Sheperd goes to the womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the battles are interrupted in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value. On the positive side, kudos at the costuming department to give Karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
