She should have named this movie ... The blonde women who had to roots their roots. Also, the main character, geese, sweaters too tight. Chichingul. I thought the guy did a good job. I always hope we will find a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. Throwing darts. He had to laugh at that. We still have 3 on the DVR to watch, maybe we'll be lucky. Oh, yes, I imagined the guy pretty quickly and I beat him when he took the flowers and then went out with my cousin. I told my daughter that she was going to the cemetery. And how stupid was the two galleries watching them spying on them? Creepy.
