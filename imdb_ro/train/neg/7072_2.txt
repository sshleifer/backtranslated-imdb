My title just about the amount of this heap of carp up should have taken a clue when I saw it was a Fred olen Ray movie - but I thought "HEY, might be better than RUBBISH's boy" , I was wrong! This must be the worst film ever targeted by children. The act was awful, the humor was nonexistent, the direction was the worst I've ever seen. "The special effects would not seem out of place in the 1950s Disney movie." What happened? "DEE-WALLACE PIATA Who had such a promising career in the 1980s." The veteran film and former child actor, Russ Tamblyn, was a terrible man, and the budget was so low that it was absolutely unbelievable, even as a children's film. I did not see the sequel in 1999, and I do not even intend to realize if you want a good baby movie. go to "MINE I SHRUNK / BLEW UP KIDS / KID" or any DISNEY movie <br /> <br /> RATING AS A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING as a KID movie: - 3/10 at the best!
