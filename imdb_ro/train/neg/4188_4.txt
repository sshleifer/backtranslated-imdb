It is an important sign for Neil Young's music and, with this glamorous praise, the film has received in many other indie circles, hit the Greendale's first presentation that we have found. My exile was short-lived because this turgid story and the poor lyrical rhythm left most of those who fell asleep or were disappointed. Neil says that the movie started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that just filmed the soundtrack. It's not the best way to create a story. No person really has a bow, and when "significant" events happen, the viewer does not care, because the film's upset levels are so great at this point. The film is a song and, for that purpose, the characters at the end leave the mouths of the songs as they sang ... the technique works for the first stanza, and then it frets from the nerves. It does not feel real or false, it feels just junk. Terrible action, with characters who find a mood and play it all. Poor light sometimes. The only kudos I can give the film are about several scenes shot as news, but the technique is so used in cinemas today that this film did not do much to support it. A good soundtrack, but I have nothing to buy. A bad movie.
