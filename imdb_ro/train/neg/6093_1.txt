This must be the biggest movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, the DVD worked well, just the movie was not really so bad that I think the actors have not worked since then (or before judging from the acting). There is no real plot to talk about and no real horror. Production values ​​are waste even for a low-budget movie, with some scenes outside being hard to hear due to the wind on the microphone. Overall, it was so bad a movie that a viewer might have thought she was going to porn if they did not know better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are funny, both spinning around the transvestite prostitute. (Although it's not worth looking at all 76 minutes for) As far as DVD marketing is concerned, I feel very cheated. You mean reading back I expected to be bad: He chose his weapons. He chose his victims. He lifted his nose. He turned into a GIRL! But I thought it might be fun. Also, the case claims to be digitized re-mastered, I would love to have seen it beforehand, printing is so granular that you can use it as sand paper. The case also says it is an absolutely disgusting film, in what way, disgusting, acting. This film is welcome in the first five minutes (if you think buying this, say "buy" bad taste "instead is a much better movie and it's amusing, too, Peter Jackson has the LOTR director in him. , if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please post here, as I would like to know, just to find out if there is a worse movie there or if anyone in this movie ever bothered to learn to act
