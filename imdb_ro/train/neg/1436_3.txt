Ouch. Some of the best British television talents have made this series, so I can only assume that they work under incredible time and had to settle for the first scenes of many scenes. scenes from this mystery of Highland (especially when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the unintentionally funny story! Like the moment the hero discovers a broken carcass on a golf course: Oh, look, it's a hand ... oh, and there's a hand there ... that's a bit boring ... <br /> For many years, fans of British TV shows have been campaigning to launch this series on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said it did not. Now I think I understand why!
