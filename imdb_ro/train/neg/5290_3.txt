Usually, I'm not a film to draw a movie. I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case there is almost no good point. In my opinion, if you do something so bad, why bother you? Part of the film deals with photographs of Anne's face as she breathes deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other side is lean and woody. Rupert Penry Jones is devoid of expression. Jennifer Higham plays Anna's younger sister with modern manners. Anne is portrayed as gentle and eminent, which is good at the beginning, but it remains the same throughout the movie and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall, production has no sense of time, with too many past mistakes, such as going out of the concert, kissing on the street, running on the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie? it was one of the most romantic scenes written.). To summarize a terrible, very disappointing movie.
