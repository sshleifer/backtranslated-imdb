Low statue, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like the writer (and one of the stars?) He had taught his own tricks and added a fancy drug and murderous fantasy to make it "hot." From the rap soundtrack and the predictable house to family conflicts, it is badly acting, stereotyped and, ultimately, terribly boring. Even the title was made before - IMDb lists FIVE movies of the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: He was seen on Showtime, who recorded the synopsis for one of the other films. It was halfway up until I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even another stereotype would have made it interesting if it had happened.
