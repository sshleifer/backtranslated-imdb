This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only the dialogue is terrible, it never ends. You think it's over, but it's not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I will never follow her again. It's as if someone has made a romantic comedy, pulled out the comedy, then decided to reduce romance, leaving us with the pile of nonsense who managed to turn to the screen. But do not keep my word for this, find out how terrible this movie is.
