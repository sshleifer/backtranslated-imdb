I rented it on DVD without previous knowledge. I was suspicious to see Michael Madsen appearing in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. Well, I think Mr. Blonde would very much like to forget he ever participated in such a shame of a movie. Apparently, if your script and your dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors flooding this movie. Too many non-native speakers speak the language of English speaker parts, read lines from a scenario that should have been cast and not made in a movie. It's unbelievable how incredible are all the lines in the sound of the movie. Music is terrible and totally out of place, and everything seems like a poor school play. We recommend that you watch it to appreciate other better movies. That's why I gave it a 3 instead of 1 worth it.
