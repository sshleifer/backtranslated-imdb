This film is for F.BI's history as Knott's Berry Farm is west old. Disappointed disinfected version of the Federal Investigation Office against crime. Hoover's heavy hand (had a different way?) Shows with quality-reading actors, chess sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart at 20% of the dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chewing the landscape, all c-lists known in the mid-fifties, with a hint of irony or humor, from the "Amazon jungle" to the "grille in the back yard," all that happens with the sound stages and the batches of the back. Even gunfire are preserved and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. With the exception of a few (very few) strangely interesting photos that make photographs, nothing of this is but a curiosity.
