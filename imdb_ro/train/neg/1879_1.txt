It's hard to believe this is a sequel to Henry Fool. It is hard to believe that the same director and actors have been involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, wizarding, comic, Fay Grim is slow, boring and does not go anywhere. Where did the intelligence disappear? I'm upset. It's been ten years since I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to look. It is not the fault of actors who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame is entirely in plotting, in dialogue and even in some filming (low budget is no excuse). Great disappointment. <br /> <br /> We are sorry I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed it, you could not enjoy it so much by Henry Fool ... the two films have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the personality of the characters ... it is a fraud to attract fans of Henry Fool to pursue the sequel. now - Henry in a kind of jail with a Taliban?!?!
