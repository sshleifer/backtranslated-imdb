Well, what can I say about this movie. I was speechless. I could say how bad this movie is forever, though the only thing I really liked about the music. And at first everything from someone commented on how much they liked. All I have to say is that she was destroyed by one of the best martial arts films of all time Fistsof angry with Bruce Lee. If he were still alive and had ever met this movie, he would be terrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a loss of tape. They say the tape, because a movie like this would not have been shot on the film. Now I feel worse because I've lost 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I've seen him even because my roommate has downloaded him out of morbid curiosity. What's the world going to?
