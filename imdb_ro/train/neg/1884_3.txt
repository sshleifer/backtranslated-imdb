Framed film about a few people in Austria during a heat wave. This type of movie was made more often, and above all, better. Stories have nothing to do with another, besides the pathetic end: "people are cruel". Ugly meat, unpleasant people and a movie that goes too far without making a point ... Ultra-realistic? A little ... Bored? Really. Not even a wonderful Franzisca Weiss can save her! 3/10
