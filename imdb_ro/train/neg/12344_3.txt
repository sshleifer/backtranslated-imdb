Tense Comedy, a sketch-like magazine, which was originally a vehicle to feature Jack Pearl's one-time radio, but now it's best remembered as introducing America to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are charged alongside Ted Healy as Ted Healy and Trei Stoogi. Although the role of Jimmy Durante (who is completely wasted on small-size material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience of the film nowadays, are the Stooges addicts and they will not find much to applaud here. Incredibly loud and arrogant, it shows how far Hollywood has to go to reach a certain level of sophistication of the slapstick. * 1/2 from ****
