"Show me your boobs!" it's not funny, and certainly not on a cartoon channel if you understand where you come from. I do not want my 6 and 7-year-old daughters to think so or hear that. I find it very sad that Nick has suggested that much and then that's what we have, little fools who behave like stupid adults. I know you have to be humorous, but to think we're there with nice and innocent girls in K and class I who can not wait to see that. I had to comment how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters will not follow her. I would like to block Nick but I do not have the heart at this point, but if Nick continues to implement this kind of nonsense, I'll have to do it.
