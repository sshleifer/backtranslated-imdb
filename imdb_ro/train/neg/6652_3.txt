This was a strange movie about a low life in New York City and centered around a main character (the name of the title, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson musician, except that he has neither a real talent. <br /> <br /> It's kind of fun to look at until a profane New York City woman with a horrible accent enters the picture and takes over. That's ruined the movie for me. Perhaps it was Catherine Keener, who usually plays painful women and garbage. <br /> <br /> Hairstyle on Pitt - an Excessive Pompadour - it was fun to look. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing this role better. A last note: it's weird to hear a movie made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen's), with a single mono sound.
