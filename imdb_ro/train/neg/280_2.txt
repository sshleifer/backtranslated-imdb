God, I was bored when I watched this pilot. I've been expecting a lot of this because I'm a great fan of James Cameron (and not just "Titanic") and his name in the credits that I thought would be a guarantee of quality, he wrote. also strange lead days ..). But the thing has failed to draw my attention at any time for almost two hours. All this time, I had just crossed the two-line synopsis and I would be very hard to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot from all the mess of threads that have not gone anywhere. Besides, I do not think the acrobats go even beyond those of any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is, of course, superb, but the fact that she only displays one facial expression, the entire film (lips and surly) makes me also bored soon she's "laughing with an attitude." You can count on this, Mr. Cameron!
