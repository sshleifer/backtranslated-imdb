I did not like this movie at all! First of all, I do not know why, but everyone says Clémence Poésy's game is excellent, which, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong! It's not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress, and that's why she has failed to play this role! She completely disfigured the heroine! It was really disgusting to watch his game! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man who did not laugh for 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eyes ... (Thank you, there are some actors in this movie whose songs were wonderful! that Alessio Boni did very well with my task! I was pleasantly amazed, he is one of the few who read the book, which is very important for the play, plus I liked the songs of our Russian actors to watch them) the thing I liked in this work was very beautiful views and stunning dresses! My advice is to read the book and understand a true meaning, the purpose with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece and can realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 of 10
