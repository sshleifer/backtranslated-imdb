I like Fulci's movies, they do, and not ironically, but I admit that they appear hopeless, inept and deformed for a lot of people. Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand to epic fantasy genre and does not really succeed. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulci movies you've seen. There are a few things happening, something more happening and occasionally a scene can be tangential to the other. It's really like Conan, no sets, no scenario, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor), no budget, stupid dog soldiers and a few gorans. a heavy one to pass through, and I could live without the centimeter of grease buried on the camera to give her the appearance of the Hair Metal music video.
