I rated this movie with 3 skulls, only the girls knew how to cry, it could have been a better movie if the actors were better, the twins were okay, I thought they were bad, but the biggest and the younger brothers have really suffocated, they seem to read the scriptures instead of acting ... spoiler: if they are vampires why freeze the blood? vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the film says to drink her while she lives ... but when she moves to another house, they get a cold that I'm frozen blood. the end of the spoiler was a great waste of time and that made me angry to read all the reviews about how this movie was great, how many awards it won this movie and this movie was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
