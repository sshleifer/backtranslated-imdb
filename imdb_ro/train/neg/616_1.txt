Let's face it; a kid who dies and his soul is transferred to a scarecrow. It will not happen! OMFG misleading poor kid who can not tell, gets its money by fucking her drunken mother wrong. Even when he dies, he looks up the scarecrow and gives his spirit to get into the scarecrow. The drunk guy covered the death, making him look suicidal, and believing she escaped her. Later, we see that he is thrown out of the trailer and later wins another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter, which includes the beat calling him a loser and the scared scared with "let one know one, missed!" A scarecrow revolves around the building, calls it "daddy" and then cuts the poor man. We can see how this wonderful movie unfolds. He continues to kill many people afterwards. Generally, he kills the people who have been hard at him in the rl and is going to kill some of his own people, just for some laugh. Do not laugh here. He adds a shot at each kill. Every time he kills someone, he would have made some karate upsets and would have finished with one of his signature points. In the case of a person who was hard to hear, he would say, "Here you have an EAR of corn!" then tighten his butt. Or we can actually take an example from the movie! He just finished the murder of a cop and was about to kill the only person who ever stopped for him. Her father, the sheriff, called the madman to stop and said, "Hey, wait a minute!" and throwing a dagger threw his chest and stuck it on a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two boys and threw in the punchline "Gotta split". and he killed two guys by pushing a seam in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to pull my pants off so badly. Perhaps next time this guy makes a movie, he will not be gay.
