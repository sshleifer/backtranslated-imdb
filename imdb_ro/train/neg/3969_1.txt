I write this because I felt like I was led to believe that Dark Remains was a good movie. Though it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, it's definitely not good. A weak script, weak actors and weak directions. Even if they can not afford a big name distribution, would it be too much to ask for an actress more full of actors? It was painful to watch a simple actress through the movie with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and scriptically stupid. The special effects were minimal. The suspense tricks used repeatedly here were hard to swallow. To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the "Masters of Horrors" episodes. But it's not quite like the quality movies yet. Dark Remains is recommended only to fans of horror who do not want to miss any genre, even if it's a poor one. Like everyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
