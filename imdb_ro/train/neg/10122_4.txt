However, yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have been made out of the contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock did not really care about this movie. There is almost no style or craft for him at all. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a married young couple who comes in some money and goes on a cruise that proves to be a test of their marriage. Emily gets a chance in a new life with a good, hearty, rich man who falls in love with her, but she chooses to go and stay with her husband. This might seem more credible if Fred did not make him a totally insensitive, pompous crowd that kisses at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. The couple gets together, but the film has no real scene of reconciliation. The third act is heading in a completely different direction, the couple being stuck on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very agitated performance as the faithful wife of an unbelieving husband. It's all you can say about it.
