I was only able to stay for the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most obvious absurdity was that while US detainees in a North Korean POW camp suffered from severe food and drug shortages, walking without bathing, trembling in dirty and dirty parks and sleeping on bare floors, and - not we forget continuous torture - I always manage to ripen perfectly. With the exception of a Harry Morgan, considered auster, as a larger army, casting and acting are simply terrible. Ronald Regan does not seem to remain in the portrayal of a single character and, instead, creates a schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A large portion of the Caucasian casting showing North Korean officers could have been forgiven, but when the Russian officers were supposed to act as Korean advisors, they wore Nazi uniforms replanted with jodhpur and jackboots (obvious costumes recycle the departments in World War II) talking with accents like General Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six types of nonsense. Do not waste time with this.
