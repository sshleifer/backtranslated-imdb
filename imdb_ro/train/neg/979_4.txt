Anyone who has a distant interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction movies to get started, which is good, but the truth is TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is much better than those series. SOYLENT is probably the best-kept secret of science. It remains one of the biggest but most forgotten movies, but the impact of its setting becomes more and more real with every passing day. Charlton Heston overcame his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of him in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touched. It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an incredible fortune (a small jam of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A big executive director of Soylent is killed and Thorn police detective is in this case. The secret of the soyed summers is not a mystery if you research the film. SOYLENT is nice to watch, but the whole script is a joke. It's as cheap as the whole production. The scenario and drama of the actors made the film, yet they were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron, and no one knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorn who likes to cast only on people's flats, see around shame and steal whatever he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you still realize SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A nice piece if you have time, but you did not expect any more.
