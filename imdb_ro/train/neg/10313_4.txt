This movie was hard to understand and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. That is, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown person takes advantage of the airline industry that does not question and GETS AWAY with millions in redemption without injuring anyone or offending the attempt. With all these embedded interests, how could someone do such an insignificant story, loaded with discussions about this true event. While Williams is always interesting, scriptwriters have assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was a heroic stereotype as a cinema star, what we get is a guy - no details or interesting ideas in the mind of a pretty bold and smart person to shoot. Harrold practically steals the film with its full and pure beauty, but the real overturn was the manipulation of the plot and the direction of the blade. Shame on this movie for even existing ones.
