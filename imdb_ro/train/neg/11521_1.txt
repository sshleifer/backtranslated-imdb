This movie is really one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It is quite surprising that something so terrible could have been done. But if you can keep in mind the plot, character development and direction, you can get a kick from the soundtrack, which is so great it's funny. The film starts terribly and quickly becomes undesirable. Someone should give somebody involved in this film some kind of consolation, because their career was probably destroyed due to their involvement in this film. If you get to see this movie or you've already seen it (I feel the pain), then those words came too late. For anyone else, Stay away at any price or realize that the movie is so bad that it will lose 2 hours of your life. Then at least you can clean yourself or something while you see it.
