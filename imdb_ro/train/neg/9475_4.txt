Very photographed and acted abilly in general, but the writing is very weak. There are such incredible scenes that there is no joy in viewing. The fact that the young boyfriend has a twin brother, for example, is so controversial that I cried loudly. And the "bulb-emotion-light" connection also seems frightening. However, I do not know. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel relaxed with something nice to watch some unpleasant comedy scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No major effort is required from the spectator. But the Italian film, especially the Italian comedy, is usually much better than that.
