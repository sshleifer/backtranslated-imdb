Ashley Judd, in a primordial role, and I think her first leading role plays the role of rebellion in this feminist soap opera. Wow, is this vehicle for extreme political correctness and liberalism or what? Be a determined feminist in real life, she must have cherished this scenario. No wonder Wing Roger critic loved this film; even in the political alley. Unlike the commentators here, I was glad Judd got up from this moron puff, better roles in the movies that made fun, did not preach the aggressive agenda of liberals.
