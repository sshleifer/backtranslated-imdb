Okay, so, somebody, some years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies storing aboard Apollo 11 and going to the moon. That's what they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. I want to give artists' poems to do their homework on hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launch hardware have fought. Graphics in general was pretty good - the launch of the rocket gave me chills, like a good rocket launch always (my popular flying machine-speed blood engine still running strongly) and 3D was pretty efficient. CG was not Pixar quality, but overall it was good. Flies have been fairly mediocre, a few-half-year old, 60-year-old anthropomorphs that have been discarded (hippie flies, African-American flies with huge african and black nuances, etc.). made noisy sounds of squelching). Writers certainly did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clich√©s (60-year-old gender policy, including useless female characters, racial stereotypes, fatty molds that just want to eat, second-degree coarse humor) . In a IMAX movie, they have breathed a wonderful opportunity to sneak into educational content about physics and space travel - they did not do the right physics (zero-g in the Lunar Module during firing burning, you please do not even bother to read original radio transcripts between Houston and astronauts, all in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like shit. But we liked the worms. So they get a point and a half for missiles and worms. Yes Yes. 1.5 / 5.
