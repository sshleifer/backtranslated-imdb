Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a warm and powerful couple, they shot this remake (near) stage scene for Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's action thriller in 1972 about a fugitive group. It almost worked for the first time, because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen - even a silent and tired stone, you could feel his ticking clock with his knife magnetism. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor - if so, this is not a presentation of his attributes. Basinger does well and definitely looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a mad role of mob-magnet. A sub-parcel involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's former partner was unbearable in '72 and is even worse here. In terms of action scenes, they are a fairly old hat, which makes you wonder: why even remake the original? ** from ****
