The direction has clearly stated that the idea and plot of this film are completely original ... however, for those who have read the "slam dunk" comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even jokes ... <Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT KNOW Kung Fu simply will not impress anyone if he tries to act like he can, many people today can see the differences .. Fortunately the film does not contain much of the KunG Fu fights and many are annoyed by stunners and visual effects ... I think Jay's act is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the movie is much better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply for his popularity. Despite how hard they want to prevent someone from pursuing this, making this film "orginal" getting what they should not have become one of China's best budget films this year.
