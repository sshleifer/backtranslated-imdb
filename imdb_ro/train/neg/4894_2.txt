Redundant, eternal photos, unnecessary photos, unnecessary scenes are what you will find in this movie. In other words, I felt technically poor. Musical bicycles are directed to the amateur (no synchronization in dancing dances, in the wrong post-sync, poor and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. Finally, it does little or even less. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas. Some of the comic elements are actually effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worsens, so it's completely unbearable and impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The trailer we saw was very dynamic, which is not true for the movie. That is, the discrepancy between the trailer and the real movie is something very close to a rupture.
