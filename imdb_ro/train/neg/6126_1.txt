For example, one of the worst movies ever made. The plot goes as follows. Run through the jungle-like areas for 10 minutes or so. Bo to go somewhere and get rid of them. Pull through the jungle more. Give him another excuse to escape. Back to the jungle. Oh, look! There's a guy who looks at Tarzan! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill people in safari. Tarzan's looking guy has a fight scene. Save Bo. Bo stripes. Run credits. Run the credits, run.
