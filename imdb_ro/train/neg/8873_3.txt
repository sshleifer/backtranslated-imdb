Did anyone stop figuring out what kind of film they were making here? Now let a former marine officer become offended by a group of children at a cadet school, so should it be a family comedy? Wrong. This is just a brutal comedy for teenagers with many unpleasant moments. It could have been pursued in a very bad way at this time, but I found that Damon Wayans' voice is irritating beyond faith. Are they talking in real life? If he does, then he has my sympathy, but he will not get any money from watching his movies
