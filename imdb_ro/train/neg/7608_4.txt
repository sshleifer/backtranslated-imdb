I admit I do not expect much of Roger Corman's movie. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scriptures. However, in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by Beckley Garland) who takes over the sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a pretty good shot, killing one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. His first task is to close the local bar that violates the restrictions in the cities. The owner of the bar tries to buy land waiting for the rail purchase (hopefully). However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans and the barmaster hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. Due to the fact that Mrs. Garland plays her sincere and realistic role, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers' She's the Sheriff "jokes. With the exception of a pair of false steps (the door of the apartment that opens from the inside, the jeep pieces and the two horsemen waiting on the screen to give the mark around a corner), the movie becomes quite acceptable as a film fare. However, Corman has not resisted filling his movie with riding scenes, just as he does in other movies. Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse work that deserves your time.
