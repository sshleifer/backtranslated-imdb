I have Mirror mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo is in it (I thought it was great in American gothic), but unfortunately she did not have a big role in this movie. Start OK and the rhythm moves nicely ... but until the end it starts to become a bit tedious and dull. That does not mean it's a boring movie, but it's just very normal and not spectacular. I did not like "possession" and did not have decent scenes. In addition, the "main" story was very confusing, and the ending does not make much sense. Still, I liked the story around the Gothic girl and how she avenged her opponents. I would not recommend Mirror Mirror for horror fans - it's nothing to get wet.
