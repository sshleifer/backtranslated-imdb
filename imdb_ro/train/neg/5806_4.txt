Nowhere near the original. It's a fairly accurate copy that does not bring anything new to the story. But the direction is very poor. Basinger is weak - no good direction. Baldwin is simply a second league compared to McQueen. I watched her out of curiosity, being a great fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I received what I thought. Almost a B movie with a second action and targeting. I'm not disappointed, I do not know what she's trying to do. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and indeed it is devoid of a very good actor of its era. He reminded me of a xerox copy of a wonderful photo. </ br /> <br /> This is a complete loss of your time. Save 2 hours or watch the original (again :)))
