Given that a lot of horror movies are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters do something stupid at a certain stage during the process, the girls in this film will collect gold, silver and bronze at the Olympic awards ceremony Darwin. A baboon with mental disabilities would have made better choices than they did and screamed less while doing so. If you like movies with a granular image, deliberately working amateur room (92-year-old grandfather has a better video camera), extremely weak sound and no discernable plot / narrative, then this is the ideal movie. Also keep in mind that you should enjoy the following: women screaming without reason, women crying without reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this movie. For example: "We need to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can not believe I spoke to her last night" "Did you call last night?" "Yes, he wanted to talk about a particular time when he was asked" "What? How did he not tell me"? As if our friend is being pursued by a serial killer with a rifle and a series of heavy weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me that she was going to a date. > Okay, so the budget is low. That does not mean you have to make it seem half the budget. The score is interesting because all - except for one - tracks were written and interpreted by the writers / directors of the film itself. In fact, it would seem that the whole budget was blown by taking a song by The Duskfall, a death metal band in Sweden. The worst thing of all in the film is the end that leaves us with the possibility of a sequel.
