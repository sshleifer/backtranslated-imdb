Horror acts, Bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes I've decided to go before seeing if a ransom happens ... It was not like that. (In addition to a nice shot at the breast) The film seems to have been filmed in a furniture store and the same deposit was used for at least 90% of the sets. You will even see this red chair in different "different locations" If you make a movie at least rented an office building and an apartment, not a warehouse that reflects your actor's dialogue (Note to manufacturers) Hiring an office space small and one month apartment is much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are pretty much more versatile and credible) If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you have it with a guarantee of return ... You will ask for your money back ... I have spent only $ 2.99 to rent tonight and I feel stuck.
