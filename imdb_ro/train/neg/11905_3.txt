With a tendency to repeat, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit her with "Paris Texas". "Land of plenty" is no exception. Considering that we anticipated a mediocre media plot just before entering, Wenders' ambitions seem to always bring them better. She was taken for races now that her films are hard to handle and bombastic. I was not sure if I was watching a comedy beating America from the Middle East or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is fully predictable. Wander's insistence on stratification of many scenes with rock songs is also intensely annoying. He covered the holes in the script and in his direction scandalizing. I'm sure many people will find this important and resounding film, but honestly, this leftist and didactic effort only speaks of a bad direction. Interestingly, Wenders asserted that, while making "Paris Texas," he had a great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, he was the best Wenders and he should now understand that he needs a good screenwriter. His films in the last 15 years + have been a total mess.
