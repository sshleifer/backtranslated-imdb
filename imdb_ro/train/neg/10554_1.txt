An "Avent-garde" movie, which has wonderful masterpieces, which has delusions of grandeur. It's hard to sit down. I received the message that child abuse is wrong. Great revelation. I had no idea he was wrong before seeing that. Yeah, that's sarcasm. DO NOT watch this "movie" if you are offended by male or female nudity. DO NOT watch if you are the least squeamish. Do not forget if you care about acting. On the other hand thinks only NOT to watch the period. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extract: movie, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, videos, director's comments, 2 versions of the trailer teaser, music video from The Azoic and a class video experiment
