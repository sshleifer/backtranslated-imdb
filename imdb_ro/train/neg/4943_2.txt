I've been watching 3 episodes of Caveman and I have no idea why I went on, except I expect to improve. <br /> <br /> For me, this show is just pumping itself off the commercials without any real humor. While we sat around watching these shows, we all speculated what would happen. The episode of the cave-woman woman with an attitude was really great, yes, for us. she's grown up in a theater and it's working hard for strangers, and the truth is said, I need a slap <br /> <br /> I think I'm a pretty good reviewer, taking everything but I have to say, Cavemen is comparable to the old show, my mother, the car. I give it a 2, only because it deserves 1 better than 1 because they actually spend money on it.
