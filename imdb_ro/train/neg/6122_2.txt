Of course, one of the worst remakes of a classic movie in the history of the film - especially since the promise of its tagline "The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time" is not even exploited in right way! Although this film has been regularly shown on television in my throat since my childhood, his notoriety (for terrified not erotic content, you remember) kept me away from her until now - and I just changed my mind that I recently enjoyed Bo Derek's previous movie, 10 (1979), and they watched a lot of fantastic things also on Christmas. <br /> <br /> Leader / producer Bo Derek is quite ridiculous playing the role of innocent sexual school-innocent banana scene) and, as expected, she was made to remove her clothes a few times, but , as it was welcomed as these scenes, she came out more sensual in 10 than she does here; As a result, Richard Harris chews up the endless landscape as a father obsessed with Jane's explorer, but John Philip Law is barely registered as a helper, who looks gently at an initial interest in Jane; the new debutator Miles O'Keeffe has the lead role and takes only 45 minutes to enter the film, is completely silent throughout the year except for his famous yodel (which is probably raised by Johnny Weissmuller anyway!) and, moreover, is as inexpressive as one of the trees they intertwine from regular intervals throughout the second half of the movie! for recording, he later played two ATOR films (or potentially imitating CONAN) for Joe D'Amato and directed by Arthur-set, SWORD OF THE VALIANT (1984). an actor, director John Derek (who also serves as stage designer here), worked with some of the best cinemas (Cecil B. De Mille, William Dieterle and Robert Rossen) and a few great actors (Otto Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel ), but he learned clearly zilch on their part because his direction is a major responsibility: sometimes grossly demanding (a witness of an extremely horrible piton attack sequence) with excessive use of the slow motion technique and the transitions of cheese; this was Derek's seventh film as director (and the second of four with Bo's wife), and eventually he managed to make only two. The total error of the film is only to be measured by the fact that Tarzan's legend was once again tackled on film - in GREYSTOKE: LEGEND OF TARZAN, THE LORD OF APES (which, surprisingly, I have not seen yet) - only three years later ! Nominated for six Razzie awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and winning one for Bo Derek, TARZAN, APE MAN was co-written by Gary Goddard, the future director of another highly anticipated transposition, the latter disappointing at the silver screen of a heroic figure, "MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE" (1987), which I will review now (yay)! In spite of a delightful succession of credits that shows that Tarzan and Jane are playing with an orang-utan and a music score that is not really bad and really challenging, the good times are defeated by an extremely stupid, white and, fatally, John Derek's clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself, which makes him emerge as an irrelevant supporter in his own self-titled movie!
