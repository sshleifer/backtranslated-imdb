This film is still one on the long line of no budget, no effort, no talented movie shot on video and gave slick coverage to tortured unsuspecting tenants at the video store. If you want to know what the viewing of this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red paint food and your movie and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night mumbling and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just made "Hood of the Dead Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. I saw a low budget, shot on video films showing talent from filmmakers and actors, or at least effort, but that does not. Avoid being a true masochist or amused by horror movies made badly.
