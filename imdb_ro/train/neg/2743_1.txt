I have to admit I have not finished this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and it is not worth watching. I looked at her with a room full of children, who also did not laugh at the humorous and brutal humor. Director Bob Dolman seems so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that he overlaps the real story I grew up with. This is not a good movie for kids! Apart from the fact that the content is so brutal, the film is just bad, has a bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a perfect story loss. If you read the book when you were younger and you loved it, then do not waste your time watching a movie that bothers you so much that it makes you angry. Buy the children of the book instead.
