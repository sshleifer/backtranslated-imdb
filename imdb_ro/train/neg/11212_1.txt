The premise of this film was pretty decent, but under the action it was simply boring. SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of death, it was accidental, so although it was a crime, it was not like the guy wanted to do it. Also, some flashbacks have a secret that reveals that it generates events like justice to a certain extent. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes are just this woman who calls her sister and listens to her message. It was boring and boring. With a polishing and better action it could have been pretty good.
