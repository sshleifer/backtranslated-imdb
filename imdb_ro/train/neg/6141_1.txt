One night I waited for my friends to come back to the hotel and "Gymkata" to happen; I looked too much from her. It's really hilarious and even frightening. Think in this way - if at your service you had an idea for something so bad and you continued to run it in such a terrible way as it did, how long did you last? Not so long as this movie. We must see, obviously.
