Strong to look, not entirely for empathy with character struggles. Two of the main characters, Cynthia Mama and Monica, recognize her daughter in a pathetic way, caressing and bitter groping. Their characters are so determined that their redemption in tolerant personalities after a quick family hat is unbelievable. It's not worth the wait. I wish a land of trustworthy among families was less a headache to see.
