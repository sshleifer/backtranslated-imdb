I saw the comment about the capsule, "great action." In my opinion, these are two great actors who perform horrible and zero chemistry with each other for a great director in his toughest effort. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and intelligent illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance is uncomfortable across the map because she has no maneuver on this character, especially because the character is so badly written. Molasses would be an adjective too fast for the painful pacing of this film. Although the intention of the film is to be an uplifting healing story of illiteracy, the look is a real "bummer". I give it 1 in 10, really one of the worst 20 budget movies I've ever seen.
