Interesting visually, but falls into the original apartment. This boring technique in the technique wears thin after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burned bread, but in his defense this film contains some of the most serious dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it keeps you away from the film and I was thinking about work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that shout blue. Paltrow is as woody as he is. This could be saved by dialogue with the noir movie or above the camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the Black & White movie (bad, computer) would have helped because it looks like Turner colored black and white. Just a big mess in a clich√©. I would break my femur rather than stay again through this endurance test.
