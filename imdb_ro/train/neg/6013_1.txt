I have read every book so far in the left series behind the film, and the movie is not at all right. Sure, I saw movies worse, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it felt as if the actors read their lines instead of telling them. The characters were rigid and inappropriate. The effects were stunning and they looked terribly fake. The end was terrible. First of all, he did not even go through the first book. Secondly, it did not make sense. If you have not read the book, you have no idea what's going on. It had to be the most cheesy movie, like the end I've ever seen in a movie. I'm angry that I actually pay money for this movie. If by a miracle they are released, they should review it completely and let Hollywood take control. The two filmmakers and the film director should let film professionals.
