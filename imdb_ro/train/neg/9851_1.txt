Even worse than David Lynch's worst "confusion", "Brain Dead" makes no sense. Those who lost their talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) blow up as if they were in a cartoon "Tom and Jerry" on acid. There is a development of negligible character. It simply starts climbing the "odd ladder" until it culminates in total chaos. Do not get involved in this because of the final actors above. They are not given anything to work with, and you will be asked what's going on for 85 minutes unbearable. I recommend you to avoid "Brain Dead" at any cost, if you do not scatter your brain in total nonsense. - MERK
