How much I like Rodney Dangerfield, it was a terrible movie. The land was a kind of holistic cutting of different films, but unfortunately they forgot to break any good joke. Besides, it was annoying and boring, and that's good. If you are looking for a good laugh, rent a copy of the private parties.
