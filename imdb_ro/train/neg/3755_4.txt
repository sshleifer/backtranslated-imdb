I liked this movie, I'll admit it. This must be the best movie I've ever seen. Well ... my friend and I decided just because we did not hurt to rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus many more. When the red neck hit the tree by Sasquatch, I literally looked at that part three to four times, it was amazing (the esteter, of course). And why? Oh, why should not the main character roll so much? Just as honestly, we know that you are in danger, that you can not help so much. But, indeed, if this movie is in your local video store, RENT IT. It's worth the money and it's not that bad, as if it were bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, the amazing complete will be in the store for you if you rent this movie.
