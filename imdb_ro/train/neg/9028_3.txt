I looked at this film and I must say that with such a premise and great talent, this turkey is there! A friend borrowed me this movie and I looked with an open mind mainly because he had such a praise for the story. Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a retired combat pilot ... why? Why did they pilot him? He is supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... well, we never see that Costner is approaching a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner turns into a Texas (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner labels along for a stroll. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten near death and Costner leads him to the meeting, which happens to a Quinn associate! But nothing comes of that ... lolly, zilcho! Why do they have the character of Gammon? Why did they sell horses to Quinn if nothing had come from him? <br /> <br /> Also, after leaving Costner to die, they turn Madeline Stowe into a whore, then attack one of Quinn's men who pays for a return ... manages with his own knife, and the next thing has been moved to a monastery! No explanation as to why it was moved or when it was done! Too much talented talent on such a poor script and bad editing! I just looked for a friend holding her and I let her look at her ... I'm gonna throw it at him for 2 hours I wasted my life looking at this thing !
