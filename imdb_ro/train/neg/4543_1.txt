I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This movie, is the direction, script, and act were completely unbearable. I returned to the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity and courage to illustrate a temerity of a wonderful story. why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. I would never recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply, none of the worst adaptations we saw turned into less ground exploration of the sky. <br /> <br /> Filming was indeed the only culmination. But how could it fail when filmed in a beautiful country such as Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.
