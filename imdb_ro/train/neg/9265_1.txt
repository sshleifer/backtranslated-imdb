After listening and enjoying Harvey Bernhard's Omen commentary, I was shocked to discover that he was behind this piece of garbage. It's like a very bad TV movie that I could see in the middle of the day when you have the flu and you're too sick to get to the remote control. I think at the very moment Michael Lerner faces what I can only describe as a high school distribution from Les Miserables, my mouth was openly distrustful. And then my mouth went up and down because we were so long. Terrible. I do not know why I have to write at least ten rows, I briefly explained, there is nothing intelligent about this whole modern version.
