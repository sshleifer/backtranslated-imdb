Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to her home, where she recently inherited from her dead sister, unaware of her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in she. Jennifer decides to sell her because she needs a lot of money to beat Granny. It also begins to have revolts nightmares that cause a mysterious raven. There was really no one to relate to in this film. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unconscious, and narcissistic, while her grandmother seemed mischievous, sad and also narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but with no one to feel it, it has been hard for me to care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> My degree: C-
