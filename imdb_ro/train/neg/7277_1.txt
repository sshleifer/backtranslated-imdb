"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst movie ever made, surpassing even "Plan 9 in Space". At least the film was useless; "Lampoon", on the other hand, is so angry and bad. Once, the movies used to respect the public's intelligence. However, it has a narrow and rotten casing to our face and then tries to rub its nose in it. Another commentator on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are nude scenes; and I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry make a bit of meat and a very beautiful meat is. But directors do not seem to realize that T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is none of these. <br /> <br /> Pervers, movie makers save the worst for the last. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays a young police officer who shows duty on the first day at work. He is associated with a tired, cynical veteran, played by Richard Widmark. For a moment, we are hoping that this film will end in triumph. Certainly, we believe that the attitude of the young man will scatter the cynic and change it for the better. Bad Hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the spark of the young man is wet forever. "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" and head for the toilet, asking us to follow him down. Nominal, this is a comedy. But where is humor?
