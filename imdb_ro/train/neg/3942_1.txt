God, what a terrible movie. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to look at this, I would be more upset. This movie is undecidable. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow, unusual film. No wonder it was not distributed too much, everyone involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camera and thumb. Beyond boring, I even hated myself. Tarintino just lost something to me. It must be a sick joke. Do not bother with this movie. If anyone even says you should look at him, kill him.
