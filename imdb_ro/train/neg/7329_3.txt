After watching this movie, I felt the persuasive need to get rid of my frustration a little. Selma Blair is a fabulous actress, currently underestimated, and Max Beesley was rather charming in "Kill Me Later." The story, while not quite original, has certainly shown a promise. Nobody had any importance. I do not know what her business is, but director Dana Lustig has practically no talent as a director. She slowed the recording down, shot up pictures, recorded reversed images, used unusual camera angles, used annoying color filters, made a quick reduction of zillion, jumped back and forth in the chronology and succeeded to do it with a "modern" soundtrack. I do not remember the last time I saw such an incompetent activity of directing a movie. Her ego has to be giant to cast the act and story, and she headed it in the front and center direction for her members to consider. They are crammed into the throat. There are some good scenes in the movie "Kill Me Later", which shows what it could have and should have been. Unfortunately, even when things start to show her promise, Ms. Lustig might find herself in her school bag trick and do things again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had a good chemistry and you could say the movie has a good heart. 3/10
