One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a useless clich√© of a movie in weakness. He tries to rotate or twist the genre with extraordinary plot lines of a slippery fan turned into psychotic - the movie laughs in nothing. (spoiler) Do we have to believe that a knife-action idiot has access and kills a baseball player in a luxury hotel without witnesses, security or cameras? The film is a nonsense that tries to shoot in our hearts through the baseball rope that ends up incredibly and amazingly. I'm not sure what all the actors thought when they took on this blast. This is as great as it will come. Stay away if you prefer to think about your movies
