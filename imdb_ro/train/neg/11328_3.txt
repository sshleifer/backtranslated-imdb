From time to time, I will rent an action / adventure film as a way of relaxing and taking care of my mind. That's why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality film, but it makes me laugh and lets me relax for a while. One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Bride Princess and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to have fun without being challenged. For the most part, I got what I wanted. Complot was something like a badly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's act was a very community theater (it's not bad for a professional boxer and an amateur actress). There were some high points on the part of Cyprus. In a way they managed to get some good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die in a rather darned time. Like most martial arts movies, the more the film has, the more emphasis there is, and the plot (which was not strong enough to get started) deteriorates almost as quickly as the actor. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director dedicates to her behind. By the end of the movie, I was seriously considering the second time only to count how many times Kathy Long's short red shorts were the center screen. Unfortunately, it simply was not enough meat for this film to make satisfying curiosity worth watching the film a second time. If you're a tough fan, the Xena fan who needs something to get away for a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents per rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. Do not expect anything but to be a little amused for a few hours. If, of course, you like Kathy Long's derriere. Then you may want to purchase a copy.
