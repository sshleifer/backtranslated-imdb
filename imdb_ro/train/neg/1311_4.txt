Jerry spies Tom listens to a scary story on the radio and uses his chance to scare his nemesis. I did not find this special episode funny: the humor seemed rather constrained and everything was (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this case, torturing Tom poor for no special reason). There is an occasional flash of inspiration (such as Tom's literal experience in the mouth and when his life is conceived from his body) but, overall, this effort does not have a frenetic passion, excellent animation and intelligence excellent of most of T & J's other cartoons.
