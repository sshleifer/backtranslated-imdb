Regardless of the BOOM's classification, it is only due to the superb photos of the Sardinian and Rome locations. Otherwise, this is true only for the heavy addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase) and RICHARD BURTON (her shift phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train does not stop there anymore" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play - but it seems he was the only one. Taylor seems to hate her and Burton needs money. Whatever would mean a bean hill where Taylor stood and smoked in her strident fashion, exploding at the servants and changing the bad words of a child with at least NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another movie when it appears finally. It's so busy that Taylor's fans are probably considered a "must-see" thing. But if you can sit down without having a drink in your hand, you are long before me. Unfortunately, this is the film that marked the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was just as disastrous, and critics called him BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
