In general, the film has a strong award and smart dialogue and, of course, Dean Martin's songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the main story of love. Cher almost does so with his reactions to Cage's shifting focus and lack of control of body language. Cage simply does not find itself in its role. He tries everything he can think of, and he meets more like an actor than a real person, and that's what is needed in a love story. Cage had the same performance problems in other roles that require more of a character like Jimmy Stewart. Cage continues to take on these roles, perhaps because he likes those movies, but his own energy as an actor does not give them, though he has improved fast. He should leave these types of roles to less interesting actors who fully engage in the film and spend considerable energy and talent in more off-the-scenes roles and films where he may be crazy about himself.
