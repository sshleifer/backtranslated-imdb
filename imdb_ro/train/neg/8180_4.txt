The reason why the DVDs of this movie are black and white is because no one can get their hands on a color print of this public film, a modest sea story at best. Distributed for television through allies Artists, DVDs (or VHS) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television printing. Films distributed for television before 1963 were often distributed in black and white prints because most viewers did not have color sets anyway. Making b / w prints for television was also cheaper as it often involves numerous fingerprints to cover all posts running a syndicated film.
