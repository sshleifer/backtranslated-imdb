I signed up for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just ended up staying in this movie and the only thing that impressed me was that I might have the strength of will not stop it. I've seen a fairly decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the fight with the sword involves swing the sword back and forth without the back and hoping that the opponent does not do the same. I've seen many better-performing student movies and stronger lands. So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with bad action and practically no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie does not even have an action and shows the developing relationship with Princess and farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister. The film has several plot lines, and none of them match anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem would have been that I saw the oak, which was pretty bad. The whole casket mumbled all their lines, so it was hard to follow what was going on. But I got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not save the movie in my eyes) If you've heard about this being a futuristic / ninja action, then you've heard the wrong way. That's what I thought was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. You run away from her.
