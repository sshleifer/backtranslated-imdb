I expected a bad movie and I had a bad movie. But I could not imagine in my fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what the Surf Blood is. It's not about surfing blood, it's a big crocodile. They complain about the Jaws fake shark, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark to the end. Here, the crocodile is often shown and is the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen and does not try to conceal it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark film, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, have some good parts? Not really, it has some nudity and a sex scene that is taken directly from a playboy movie. The actress is not bad at all, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad he does not take it up. The main actors are neither evil. They had a potential. The place was beautiful and the movie starts fine with some pretty surf scenes. Blame is on the unrelated writer and director. Dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is very badly written, and the director has no talent that has no fancy. This one. Even if you want to look at beautiful Kate Fischer. It's not worth it. Watch Sirene to watch Kate Nude and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. 3/10 because they are in good shape and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked and Kate looks good (but she is a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece they were supposed to work with .
