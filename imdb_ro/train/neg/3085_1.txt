Description: Corny, absolutely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it will make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people even wasted 2 months or less to spend a budget (I guess that ...), probably no more than $ 700 for make this movie. It was just hysterical to look with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Enjoy your time, life and money by NOT - I repeat, DO NOT even wonder if you should see this movie. This movie is so horn, it will make you purple boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You may admire him. (As I said before, if you have a one-digit IQ) With about 12 of your actors, some dolls you bought at a garage sale and, of course, rooms and music, I gaurentee you will make a fun movie a little more fun than this piece of absolute crack.
