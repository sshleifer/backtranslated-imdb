I can not for my life explain the popularity of the television show for children, the power of rangers is all about. I never understood why innocent children liked this show first, since the characters seem so idiotic and do not deserve to take care of anything. The costumes look completely atrocious, like multi-colored spandex, which people wear to go to the gym. What is the purpose of this show anyway, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What happens to the terrible hair cuts and the clothing on this show? Not to mention this show is still playing on cable television, just to make money to teach children how to fight each other when they disagree on a particular issue. There is much better fun for today's children, we hope that they are not as naive as the children of the 1990s who watched this show. Oh, and what happens to the homo erotic tension between red and green rangers, anyway?
