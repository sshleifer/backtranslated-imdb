Filmed film about a good but brave couple who decides to live their dream and take people on diving trips. The pair almost instantly chooses the wrong customers and mixes with people who seek to recover the elements we see fall into the ocean floor during the opening of the loans. A direct trip to the video could have been much better if it were not so interested first of all to look good. The performances are operational and the plot is not really bad, or it would have been for the director and the producers not to redirect the plot to make sure we see a lot of people well-dressed in swimsuits (or what I guess the reason for "" a few moniker empty fleeting breasts). The film does not generate any tension and does not rise above the level of a forgotten TV movie. If you are accompanied to see this, you will not get your eyes off because eye candy is nice, but we really have to stop producers making movies that are excuses to have a paid vacation.
