An inexhaustible and steady film where the characters are sitting around the cameras or a rocket ship and talking endlessly. It might be thought that things would spark when exploring Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a red / orange heavy filter that makes everything very dirty. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and monsters are completely unconvincing. There are echoes of the "Monster Bride" when the heroine gently strokes the octopus as a tentacle of a plant eating meat around it before colliding a bit, the difference being that Ed Wood is a hundred times more fun. Better use your ears when you follow the otherwise "science fiction" music, repeated indefinitely, it will make you crazy. If you are unable to sleep one night, just slide it into the video camera and your insomnia will be cured as soon as possible.
