I did not really like this movie at all. It was not even funny and, in some cases, it was really stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely an extremely talented individual and while his action was good in this, he seemed a real waste for him to stand in position. I mean there were a few parts that were good and somehow humorous in a nice way, but that's about. The only thing that attracted my attention during the whole attempt to see above the jokes was that they were very beautiful women present and I'm not one to see a movie only because of that, but in this case it was the only nook where the least redemption could be found. Generally, there was a lower couple under a medium movie! <br /> <br /> Final Query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: So glad I did not waste too much money on this. > <br /> Shopping DVD: Ummm, let me think .... no! Hire: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.
