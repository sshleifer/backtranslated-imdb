The Darkling was a very exciting and fun movie, while Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through, F. Murray gets zapped because The Darkling is a kind of creature like demons who enjoy vicar life. He takes abductions and losers and perverts them while giving them everything they want in terms of success. He feeds on their joy with the seven deadly sins. However, part of it is that it needs people who might be wrong, but not bad. Otherwise he can not "pervert" their natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in Barry White's voice, which I found so charming and funny. Very funny. How would you imagine Barry White if he was a little dwarf and told Aiden Gillen: "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, come here, Dee Plane!" Throughout the movie, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) speaks with Aiden Gillen in Barry White's voice, saying things like "It's good to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed a crime, you're really moving around the world" and other remarks that sound like advertisements for "Being Evil" Stores or something. He's really hilarious in a sick way. In any case, Aiden Gillen is not F. Murray Abraham, and film tanks as soon as Murray gets ax (or knifed?). F. Murray brings some malicious malice to his role in this film. He's a good actor. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, has a happy smile on his face and shows that perhaps he can be his English language compiler. the class never hit the mythological characters and could not imagine what it was about the movie. ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comic. If this movie was a parody, the conclusion was perfect. If it was not a parody, then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to offer an impressive film that the film itself could not offer. The people who made this film lost everything they wanted to do with him sometime before the end. It ends just as if they just realized they were out of money and had to shoot a quick finish.
