Ouch. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rupture of Ringu from Japan. Well, I think the US made their version, but at least it was a remake remarkable. So, so sad. I really enjoy filming Filipino movies and knowing that some great things can come out of such a small country, so I can not believe that this has to happen. Claudine and Kris are so big there, surprised to be affiliated with plagiarism. For any filmmakers aspiring to the Philippines: you do not have to stop to earn money. There are many movie lovers watching the movies of the Filipinos taken out and enjoying them!
