<br /> <br /> This movie sucks for a long time. He reminded me of the film Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which we also found extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is in any way a poorer film. <br /> <br /> Only a good one in the cast who does something for this movie is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the old ladies in the history of European films. I liked maniacal appearance in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time with this movie. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
