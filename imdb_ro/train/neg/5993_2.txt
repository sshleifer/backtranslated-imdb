I grew up (1965) watching and loving Thunderbirds. All my colleagues at school followed. I played "Thunderbirds" before school, lunch and school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. The count of 5 has become a form of art. I took my children to see the movie in the hope that they would have a look at what I liked in childhood. What a bitter disappointment. The only high point was the fast-moving tone. Not that it can compare to the original Thunderbirds score. Fortunately, early Saturday morning, a television channel continues to play series of the Gerry Anderson series and his created wife. Jonatha Frakes should hand over the chairs of his directors, his version was completely hopeless. A loss of film. Wipe rubbish. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a big mistake in judgment.
