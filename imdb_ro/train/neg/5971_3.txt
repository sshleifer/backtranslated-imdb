I was talking about watching this movie by a friend who was murmuring about what a cute story this was. Yuck. I want my two hours back, as I could have done many more productive things with my time ... such as, for example, big finger movement. I do not see anything of redemption about this movie, except for her eye-candy look ... 3/10 (and that's generous)
