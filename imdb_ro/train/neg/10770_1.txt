It may contain possible spoilers (Not that nothing in this movie is new or even will surprise you easily for that.) Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything he ever did in oblivion? Of course it is cheaper for them, but after a while, you do not think that a general quality and the way people think about them would escape. House Of Villains is a desperate poster of cartoons that make no sense at all. Some signs of total ignorance of previous films in this respect are: Voices do not even fit remotely and Iago is bad again (Since when?) I know these movies are direct to the children, but there was a time where everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the movie (which for years has been Disney specialty) was embarrassed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone even to the little one. All I can do is, if more films of the same caliber are released, it's just a matter of time before a small animation studio overtakes Disney in general.
