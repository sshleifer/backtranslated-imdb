In fact, the movie is neither horror nor science fiction. With a very strong religious theme, this film offers minimal content and no suspense. Lower-level actors are doing decent jobs to read their dull roles. The only good performance is Sydney Penny, who plays the role of a mother ... I will not spoil the movie, either Christ or Antichrist. Avoid viewing this movie if you are not a Christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse. Being a non-Christian, I had to force myself to see this movie just because I wanted to write this review. It is a shame that the Sci-Fi channel has had to film this movie at peak time.
