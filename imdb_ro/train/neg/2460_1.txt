I really wanted to like this movie, but never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip-hop theme, but it does not work badly. It feels constantly as if it were written and acted by high school children for a school project, and this is also the level at which humor seems to be moving. There is no subtlety, and rather for a mockumentar, it never feels like a documentary. And while the lines are not funny in the first place, a deadly delivery attempt would have helped - certainly, anything better than a survival blow to which we are subjected. d recommend this to people who like "comedy" in "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think words like "ass" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste time.
