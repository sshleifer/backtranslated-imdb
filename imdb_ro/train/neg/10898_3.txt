If you like to comment on movies in which the script reaches the middle of the movie then it is one. An atmosphere and an attitude like a porn movie, but nothing happens just with some strange and touching the third guy. Which becomes very boring after 45 minutes, but it is not action. Some of the actors I've seen in real x movies and who played then was much better. All the special effects are made by the great "Rondo", who realizes all the magic with his mind. A cult movie is written on the box. This means that this film should not be seen at all ????????
