Personally I think this show seems quite cheaply done. Some actors are terrible. They make it over and seem fake. I can always say how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less to watch, because it makes it so transparent. Not very well written. I like to see how to laugh. You know, "Is it so bad that it's okay?" Well, this affirmation applies to this show. I also like to look just to see if I'm right when I think everything will end. So far, I was right every time. It's like a little game I play. It's beautiful when you get bored and feel laugh about something.
