The worst DCOM I've seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. It was bad. Action and story were good, but SUCKED effects! They were so fake! The only good fight was between the brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene I was excited about. Overall, I found this movie very boring and the movie ended abruptly. <br /> <br /> I will give her a four for Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and a fight scene. <br /> 4/10
