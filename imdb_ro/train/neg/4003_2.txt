Great disappointment. This was one of the best performances of British crime / detectives in the 1990s, which developed the fascinating character of the title played by Robbie Coltrane in Scotland. However, this one option has little to add and may suffer an inevitable abandonment because of high expectations when a favorite show returns after a long break. Coltrane does not have much to do, much more attention is given to the unintentional killer and what he has to do, he seems unimpressed, almost bored. The story of the ex-soldier is written by books, and the attempt to update Coltrane's family life seems to be easy. Perhaps if writers had a whole series in front of them, instead of just a two hour show, they would have written this much deeper. As it is, skip this and watch the old Cracker of the 90s, which is much superior.
