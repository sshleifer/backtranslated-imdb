I am an A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in the classroom, and what I came out of was the obvious bias involved in the film. The film is clearly inclined towards P.O.V. of the "usual perception of deaf people" is not an intermediate field. Also, the film did not make or take into account other situations that are also debated on this subject. I.E. The deaf people who were born hear and later deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? The film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of deaf people with capital "D". Not that this is bad, but to make it a true documentary, you should try to be a little impartial.
