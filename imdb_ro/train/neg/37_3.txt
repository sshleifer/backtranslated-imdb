Devil Hunter has gained notoriety for being on the DPP's "Video Nasty," but it really should not have been. Many movies on the list where there are only known reasons for God (and DPP) and while this is not the best of them; there is not much to justify the ban ... which is a shame because I would not have gone through it if not for being on the "shopping list". The film gives the film a decent base - or at least a decent base than most cannibal films - and follows an actress kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find it, but along the way he must courage indigenous people, led by a man called the "Devil" (hence the title). The film is based only on eighty-five minutes and there are not really many scenes of interest. It is a shame that Jess Franco has come to make such films, because the man has a clear talent; as seen in films such as Dr Diabolic Z, Venus in Furturies, Faceless and She kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately, his good movies are just stones amongst the piles of crap, and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the shit. I saw this movie only because I mean that I saw everything on the DPP list (only two more) and I think that's why most of those who saw it saw it. But if you are not looking for Nas- titati; there really is no reason to bother us with this.
