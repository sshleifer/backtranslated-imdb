What terrible garbage! Who's calling all these people who eat how good this is? Yes, it is "arty"; and yes, it is "alien," but ... it is not enough. The plot is boring and disjointed, as a reality, but not so thin. <br /> <br /> People are intrinsically uninteresting; but as characters do not have a depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, then I feel very, very bad for them. Violence (and some of it very violent) seems quite ostentatious and free. It's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I think too much about him. And oh yes: if I had neighbors like this, I would move!
