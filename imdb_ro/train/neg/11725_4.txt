STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is hiding in his farm in Montana after failing to surprise a terrorist notorious. Then he was approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go. His target has been detained there and is subject to heavy police protection - but I just do not want to capture their man - they want to take him out. Everything goes well, but the mission gets disturbed and when a police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance), is killed, the blame falls on Dial's feet. Hunted like an animal, he escapes to a nearby home, and joins a young woman named Emily (Eliza Bennett), who deals with her own problems and becomes his unexpected invasion as he removes his name and works, they betrayed. <br /> <br /> The latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade movie has come out of nowhere, with minimal advertising even for something so small (I do not remember seeing commercials or trailers for that anywhere). and after Snipes' history of duff DVD efforts, this would seem like one that Snoop Dawg would tell you to get rid of as if it were hot. But I had to give him a way anyway. It does not fall among the worst, but it does not reach any higher value than the standards of some of the best (Detonator, 7 seconds, it says all, really). At best, this is slightly suspensive, with a minimum of action, not in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly the best role in the lead role. Also, in a supportive role, it is quite clear that Dance appeared just to check the payments, too, and generally this is not one that none of the distributors want to shout on the hills about any of their CVs. <br /> <br /> It is said very much that, after all, the only "contract" you are interested in is when Snipes closes with Sony and with it will stop any other EL DVD movies . **
