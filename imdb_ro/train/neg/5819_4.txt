This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. Parents divorced and their mother stays back to the east in the house. The father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children in California and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best possible education. Things become funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, lives with the group. The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the wealthy neighborhood. Jessica Walter costs a woman who wants Murray to move with her when she wants a partner. Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno are coming to an end. They interpret Murray's brother and sister, respectively; are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner lets them remind Murray that she pays the bills for them along the film. The film ends in a sour note, while the embarrassed family moves away from their fantasy hoop and rides them to Beverly Hills in the car. I think the film promotes independence and good old self-esteem.
