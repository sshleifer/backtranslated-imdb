Some people do not like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable when this movie was made. There are lots of older cartoons I just love. My problems with this movie are not animation, but basically how it was built. Characters are all ... well, stupid. And for this movie, it should not be. Apparently, everyone in LOTR has a limp problem (for starters). Just how they acted gave me annoyed in general. The two sisters and I laughed most of this film. I think if many people would have seen this before seeing the new ones, they would not have left. I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it. There are some movies that give me a headache. This was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, even though it's up there. Or there, depending on your point of view.
