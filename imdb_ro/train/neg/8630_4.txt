I know that in this episode there are things other than what I'm going to talk about, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, after receiving a very negative opinion that Jin saw Sun's retrospectives in the "Sunrise House", we will see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so profoundly incapable that it made me much more comfortable with the whole episode. Until now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirts, he had been suggested that Sun's father was someone who was enriching himself by shady and illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a boss even; mobs operate in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode, we find out that Sun's father is, in fact, the head (or executive director) of a Korean automobile company, and that what Jin did was the physical attack of a government official (to be killed ) in his name. I may be particularly sensitive to this because I work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is offensive and racist SPECTACULAR to even suggest that this is happening in Korea; that huge, serious companies such as Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this fictitious automotive company because they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these Mafia-like methods instead of any regular West Automobile Company . it is incredible to me that the writers have the misfortune of writing something like this in the story, and that there was no worsening in Korea over her. It feels like "Buy American!" propaganda, portraying foreign companies as criminal, undeformable, third-world cars.
