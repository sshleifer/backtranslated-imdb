I've finished watching, I can not say I was impressed. Start pretty well, visual and the atmosphere offers a creepy feeling like this kind of movie should. But it all ends when the first lord monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the Lords, but I'm very bad in the movie. The ladies with leather jackets and piercings are 80 years old. As for the story, it starts from similar horror films, people trapped in a hole of hell. But there is no clear story about what and what is happening. The viewer is thrown down by a few lines for possible reasons, but the lines never meet and reach nothing but a mess. With all the money spent on this movie, with an interesting start and some good effects, I was thinking that someone would have taken more care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this film just to prove that their costumes could be scary (except that they are not). So, the movie becomes believable for the visual, I think the money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt of a rock band to make the monsters aliens more dizzy.
