One of the reasons I remember is that it was presented the week after Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS series was broadcast. Trailers emphasized that the main character had a mutilated arm, who had hoped to be like Victor Caroon of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT following the streets of London. There is no luck because the RACING GAME is just a strange thriller with the gimmick of having a physical disability hero who is trying to get to the bottom of the corrupt horse racing investigations. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis, you can enjoy it but put it in the context of the late 1970s, when SWEENEY just finished and the PROFESSIONAL is still going on, is something NOT RUNNING THE RACING GAME. A trailer had a car that would take another engine, if it were a SWEENEY trailer, you saw Jack Regan take a car and beat a clue from the slag that made a blag over time which PROFESSIONALS would have had to take a car and blow up the terrorists inside. I think he sums up what's wrong with this series
