This movie sounded like it could be fun and exciting from its description. But for me it was a little disappointment. Very slow and hard to follow and see what happens. It was as if the director had taken some individual film pieces and blew them into the air and combined them in any way they landed (certainly not in sequential order). Also, nothing was shot about the consequences. I've seen quite a lot of different Korean films, and I've noticed that a good part is well done and requires thinking on the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But that made me stand out. I saw the second and third film and still did not do anything to me. I still do not understand what the director tried to convey. If I were to show only a typical portion of a person's life, I think he did. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
