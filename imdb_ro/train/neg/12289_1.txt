I get sick of movies that sound fun in a synopsis of a single line, then match what you find in the bottom center of a compost heap. Who knows: "Witchery" would look interesting in a pitch at the studios, even with a "big cast name" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink wink, nudge-nudge) and effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef , a woman ... ). But on the film, it collapses faster than a paper-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in an island mansion on the eastern shore, and one of them (a woman, I guess) is directed by a Satanic cult to bear the child of hell, while the others are grotesquely wounded, . Well, right there you have a cross section of "The Exorcist," "The Omen," "Ten Little Indians," and several other smaller films in Satanic-worshipers-amok line. None of them is fun, and for the most part you will be piercing your way from scene to stage until it's over. No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff will help too much. They are only in it to raise a salary and do not seem very intent to give them their "all." <br /> <br /> In his opinion, Hasselhoff probably wants to go back with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; a PETA celebrity benefit or a pro-am golf tournament or whatever else is today. And the scenes of torture! Ecchhhh. You will see that people catch their stitches, sneezed inside the red fireplaces, wrapped in trees during a violent storm, ships that break out of the throat, etc. etc. Sheesh and I thought that the "Mark of the Devil" was the most sadic movie I've ever seen ... Do not disturb yourself. It's not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. If you follow him, see if you can count clues. And yes, Blair becomes possessed, as if you did not see it coming to Main Street, followed by a marching band. "Witchery" - these witches will peck you.
