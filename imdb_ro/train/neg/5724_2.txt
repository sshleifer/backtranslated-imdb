I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had a terrible adventure. Yes, it was a lot of gore and nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow, meaningless plot and a mute end. Where should it have been filmed anyway: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing this. A technical discomfort that I have with the DVD is that if you close the Spanish subtitles, they come back after some scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, do not waste your time with deleted scenes because there is no sound and it seems to be just tourist images.
