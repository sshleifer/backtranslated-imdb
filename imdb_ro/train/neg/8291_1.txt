An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife was unfaithful. So there are no new story lines here. However, the authors managed to create a bad and disgusting film. If you love watching babies vomiting or seeing a dentist who thinks he's all drawing his wife's teeth into a kind of blood horror, visit (or rent) the movie. If not, go to something else (MEA FAIR LADY, whoever?)
