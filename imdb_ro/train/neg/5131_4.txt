I liked it, but I think I could have traveled at the same time. This resumption of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a formidable, absolutely impressive Romcoman, rescued from the direct destruction of the film when released by Janeane Garofalo's sharp tower. Playing Frasier of Pets, she is caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass on her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when a caller comes to a yard. interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. A British average actor shot a movie shot at Hollywood with this film. He is unimaginable and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising based on it, although he appeared in substantial cameo in both later films by Terence Malick. Uma Thurman makes an autopilot return, and Michael Lehmann packs all together competent. Icky sex phone, though. 4/10
