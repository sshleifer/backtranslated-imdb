You can consider some facts in the discussion as spoilers. I'm sorry, but Spielberg does not deserve to win an Oscar for this play and I think the Academy was right about that. vote. (Other Oscars for Best Actor nominations and more ... I do not know about, but it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) How Spielberg directs this is so controversial, so disturbing. While watching this film, a distinction made during the movie "Film as Art" that I got screamed, "Feeling is a frankly honest, honest emotion. Sentimentality is sweet and unreal, a false vision of life" . This is sentimentality above. When in real life two people begin to read aloud synchronicity, like Celie and Shug Avery when I sit on the bed, passing over the Nettie letters they found? There are examples of this kind of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men who are crowding around Miss Millie and then jumping unison like a flock of birds that take off when going to go away; Harpo falling through the roofs of the various buildings he works (a cheap gagar); the whole jar-troop that heads from Jook's village toward the table, as if it were magically enthusiastic about the choir's singing ... and so on. Nothing is true. I even wondered if Harpo's name was deliberately chosen because it's his wife's real name, "Oprah," back. Spielberg is not above these "cutentes". It's not that Spielberg is incapable of acting honestly and emotionally. Schindler's list was amazing, moving deeply for me, and I very much admire Ryan's private salvation for his realism, even if the story is a little controversial.
