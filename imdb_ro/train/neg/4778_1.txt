This is the worst show I have seen over the years. I think it should be taken by TV because of its delay. It's so bad I could be faint when I watch her. (even if I never look because she is poor SOOOOO) Goofs: When mac says he can not eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it! In the episode "Eddie Monster" when he calls Eddy at Terrance, he falls into the box twice, plus the time he falls down he does not fall, he falls to the side. How stupid. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I really did a song with my band about how retarded this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
