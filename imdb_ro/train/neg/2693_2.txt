<br /> <br /> Although the lead actress is STRICTLY beautiful, the plot has little chance of acceptance because too many details distract the audience during the story. It may be thought that middle-aged middle-aged girls in the 1950s easily gave their virginity without thinking of marriage to the 30-year-old they barely know, but I doubt. It may be thought that teenage high school teens are very self-confident and self-assured that they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has often been teenagers feel very strange and act as embarrassment as they experience the adult world . > <br /> It might be thought that an experienced medical doctor would not know the wasting stroptomycin - the secondary fermentation product of the occupied earth microbes - and will not detect the fact that some gentle mild powder is false, but I think not. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can be thought that those who are making trouble for 30 years can enter a public school lounge during a social school and you are having trouble, but I think school socialism is traditionally a protected environment, and parents, chaperones and school staff would be around this phenomenon. <br /> <br /> A last son, during Hey Babu Riba, the five adolescent friends referred to themselves as the four. There is probably an explanation of why FIVE were FOURsome, but because it was never detailed, every reference distracts from each scene. This movie did not ring for me.
