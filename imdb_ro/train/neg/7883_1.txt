The deceptive cover, the title and the very small hidden print of the prayer power deceived me in renting this film. It started very well and dragged me inside. I liked very much. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of it, the film began to throw things that were not set up and made no sense. My first thought was: "This is not written by someone who can tell a story." I've come to watch the movies, thinking I lost something. Until I arrived in the last 1/5 of the film, it was ALL THE PRAYER DIALOGUE, THE YEAR, RELIGION did not make sense, she said nothing and was annoying to listen; We stopped the sound and made a quick move to the end. Do not waste your time with this move. Beware of DVDs called Whitlow Films and Level Road Productions <br /> <br /> And I'm a practicing Catholic.
