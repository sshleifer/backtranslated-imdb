(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed) We have seen this movie with extremely low expectations and, unfortunately, I can tell you that the film has barely lived up to them. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked to see Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, writers would have to realize from the beginning of the screenwriter's process that seven people who fall into the water are not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, those that are not, it's simply boring. I smiled three times throughout the movie. Placement of Swedish products Findus is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign says; "Findus did it!" GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not have to be seen at the cinema or DVD, wait for it to be on TV, it will not take long.
