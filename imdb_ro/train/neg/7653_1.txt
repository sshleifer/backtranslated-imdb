First of all, I would like to say that if I had to vote honestly from 1 to 10, then I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is HERE bad. Everything from story, to director, to editing is terrible. The story is not at all decent at first (you can not expect too much because it is based on a video game, something that was not aware of the movie), but the direction and editing made it even worse. The film cuts in awkward points and leads to scenes that have nothing to do with the previous ones; some, as a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to be stunned by seeing how the characters do not show any sense of each other. You could come in this movie waiting to see a bunch of nonsense on screen for an hour and a half and you'll still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, then you lose your money, and if you do not pay anything, then you lose another hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not look at it.
