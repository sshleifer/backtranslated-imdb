The film itself is so pathetic. She represented deaf people as being cynical to the people who heard it. True, some deaf people are cautious about meeting people, but they are not necessarily upset by Marlee Matlin's character throughout the story. The deaf do not go to the bar and dance like Matlin did. Generally, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring I'd like to think it's a cure-insomnia movie. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply pop into the children of a smaller God and watch. He'll go to bed. <br /> <br /> Remember, this is a deaf guy talking.
