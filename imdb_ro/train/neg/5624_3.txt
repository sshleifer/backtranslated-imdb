In his short 40 years on Earth, author Jack London has managed to squeeze out as much adventure and incidents as possible. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of human life, but obviously fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface and remains a very storied story for a modern story. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both robust and sympathetic. It's not the problem here. There is no young and very beautiful Susan Hayward playing her future wife, Charmian, whose biography in London is the "base" of this film. Life in London has been divided here into a series of episodes, where the film moves easily. So, we have short incidents with London like an oyster pirate, a seal in the Bering Sea, a gold prospect for Yukon, and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese war ... colorful events, of course, profound treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santell (also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen" in 1939) is the most meaningless. Doing stranger things here is a very poor quality DVD with a scary print source and a sound full of sounds. Perhaps the best thing about this rental movie, for me, was one of the DVD extracts: a catalog of all Alpha Video films, with hundreds and hundreds of full movie posters. Let's hope these movies are in better shape than "Jack London"!
