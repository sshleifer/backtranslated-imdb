There is a lot of talk about torture nowadays. That's all this movie. It's a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his benevolence, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From that moment on, he was attacked by him only for blows. I do not know at what time do you do something about it. There is a wife and a child there somewhere; has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been a few moments when he could have acted. The film seems like someone's joke. I suppose that, following Manson's assassins, I had a bit of a hold on the two. However, why would anyone make a movie like this? What calls it has, except sadism. The conclusion is totally unsatisfactory, but it could have been remedied by an obvious turn of the plot. Good. Another hour and a half of my life.
