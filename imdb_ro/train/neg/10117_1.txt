Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad movie B Horror and I found this Gem. I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like just the movie for my mood. I brought them home and put it on. This movie was not the B Horror movie I had in mind. It was much worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got, I did not know that this shit exists between man. This movie seemed like a 5-year-old wrote and directed it and that's nice about it. I'm an aspiring director and this movie made me so upset that someone there is actually paying this guy for direct movies. He has to work at a garbage pit that throws shit where he belongs to. If you think about renting it or buying it. I will tell you the same thing as saying that someone is preparing to commit suicide. "DO NOT HELP, NOT MULTI!" I do not have much to say about this movie. DO NOT TOUCH!
