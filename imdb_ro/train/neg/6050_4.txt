I simply can not believe the number of people who compare this favorably to the first film. I moved to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to make money for the success of the first film. The dialogue is terrible and is not as authentic or convincing as the original movie. The story is ridiculous, portraying the ridiculous French police, and characterizing Doyle a mile away from the first film. </ b> <br /> How many drug bosses do you think you go to docks in person to see a shipment? The ease with which Doyle finds his man is just pathetic. Like the French police just drink coffee until Doyle returns from America and does REAL police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign town and discover the biggest crimes in place with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really terrible sequel, whoever else thinks is crazy.
