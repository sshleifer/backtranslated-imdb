This is not a very good story of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in baptism! Bo Derek in '10 'was at least a humorous film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing but soft porn. If you're in this, okay, then go back to her and jump over the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was once again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show his terrific actor. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more interesting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than he; this was one of his few mistakes! do not waste time with this movie ... go buy the book.
