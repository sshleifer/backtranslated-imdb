Have you ever heard this phrase when it comes to this movie? "Herbie: Full of shit" and yes, it's true. This movie is really terrible and total blades. This became the second worst film Lindsey is ever in the Confession of Queen Teenage Drama. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the cast over talent, which is by far the best movie than millions of times and is the only selling point of the movie. I do not see how such an actor respected that Matt Dillon could be part of this movie does not read this terrible script before joining him? <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy as an extraordinary skill and climbs the wall and goes faster than a racing car after all that's just a Beatle. I know it's a children's movie, but they went overboard with it and just turned out stupid than fun. It takes little realism, plus the story is too predictable. Final words: Unless the children are in fact 5-12 years old, I doubt anyone can enjoy this film meaningless. What a waste of my money. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
