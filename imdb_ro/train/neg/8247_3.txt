However, another romantic romantic comedy, which audiences around the world seem to have a bad appetite. This weak effort is an unintentional genre parody - all classical clich√© scenes are here from ridiculously misunderstood misunderstandings after running trains to declare your love. Characters are one-dimensional cartoons, except Love-Hewitt, which manages to bring a certain cohesion to the film. Things threaten to get out of control in the plausibility department as the movie progresses; our good suspension of faith finally comes to fall in the absurd end. If you are looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill experience, you will not find it here.
