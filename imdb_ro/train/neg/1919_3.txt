I have read the book several times and this movie does not work exactly as it should. I could leave this slide, it is, however, a movie. However, I have serious problems with setting the film. No one has said that this film and the book on which it relies is based on real events that took place in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this movie is supposed to be based. First of all, the "little" city about decoration is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the landscape of the movie is wrong. Grand Island is located in the valley of the Platte River. That is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me angry to see my home town treated so badly. This was a real event. Large sections of the city were deleted. In her book I'm talking about riding a bike at the Island of Mormon at Fonner Park. I think you could if you do not mind a 15 mile ride in every direction.
