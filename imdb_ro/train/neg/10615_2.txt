Strange as little as 2 hours can seem like a whole life when you stay in such a flat, inexpensive inclination. If a story is just as personal as it was supposed to be for Sally Potter, would not you expect a little passion to show you in her performance? Her action was completely detached and I did not feel any chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes, which should have been warheads in view of the nature of the dance, were strange and painful to watch. Obviously, disclosure of such a personal story on the film may be daunting and as such, Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take over the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own dominion.
