Horrible. I see many user comments about how great this show is. It's Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. Jokes are blades like ... and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously striving to be fun and probably twist when they hit those terrible fists (if you can call them that). Most other commentators are obviously from another planet (or at least from another continent). There is a clear reason why television companies cancel broadcasts ... and none of them is when shows are doing well. Makes sense? Anyway, direct - even if it rains and there is absolutely nothing else to do on this planet ... go in the rain - more fun.
