... Fortunately, he has not done it yet! This is a brutal, simplistic student policy, transformed into drama. It takes the viewer to buy in a series of conceits. Concept 1: That a British elector can be turned from being basically the right center to be overwhelming to the left. Conclusion 2: That the whole mass media and general public debate is unanimously concluded and that new critics of the new prime minister are sinister officials, MI5, big business and Americans (naturally). Concept 3: That this radical Socialist Prime Minister can solve all trade union, economic and social problems with perfect ease in a way that unites the nation. Conclusion 4: This is a good thing that separates all ties with the US and NATO. Conclusion 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had a period closer to them in the 1980s. And finally, Conceit 6: That the reactionary forces of the United States would actively try to launch a coup against the United Kingdom. It's ridiculous and the show just gained the reputation of doing it by trying to make money on an anti-Thatcher feeling in the country and have left TV critics out of the wings singing its praise. When it was made, television was still a very popular and influential environment, with performances getting huge ratings, so a story about drama with a clue of controversy had a good chance of having a big audience. Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. History and time have shown a huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show.
