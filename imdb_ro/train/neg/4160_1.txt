This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I looked at it with a large group of friends and when it was over, not one of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only redemption factor of the movie is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can not laugh when a zombie laughs while the actors do a heavy dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can meet and have a good laugh. Now it's a joke running between my friends and myself. 1 out of 10.
