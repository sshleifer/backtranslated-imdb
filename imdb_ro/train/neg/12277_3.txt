I found the "Arab Conspiracy" in a store and I thought I had discovered a lost treasure. People, there's a reason you do not hear much about this movie. The plot is dirty, the rhythm is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is just as vivacious as simply cold tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Even Sean Connery can not save him.
