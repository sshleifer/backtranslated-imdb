if I had the option of negative numbers I would use it. This movie was really terrible of God. I entered the theaters, waiting to be horrible, and somehow managed to surpass my expectations. The script was weak, the act was painful. I wanted to go, but my boyfriend was driving and wanted to get money worth, I think we were both disappointed. Breast augmentation when girls have super power and hair color change was wrong. Eddie Izzard seemed to be mistaken for the role of a super-villain, came as a weak and stupid freak. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came as psychotic and weird, just like Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
