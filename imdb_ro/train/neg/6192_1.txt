Robert Carmichael's Great Ecstasy is a bad movie in every respect. The script, the stupid rhythm, the lack of depth in any character, the unnecessary sub-parcels, the terrible act, the unnecessary climax make it possible for this worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything pleasant, pleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark with their moody illumination, their long and long silence and their classical soundtrack. If so, they have failed completely. I was just bored and would never want to forget. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any price.
