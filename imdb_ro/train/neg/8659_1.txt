There are a few things I can never understand. Such as this movie. What if I created a Dino and crocodile polygon model really really cheap and scary in Maya and then cut it off and stick it in an amateur video where people scream and eat the same thing? How can anyone even think that a completely fake CGI dinosaur, which seems completely untouched, would influence the events in this movie? I know that his B-grade budget, the low budget, and all the producers, except the producers, could do better than make a piece of nonsense that nobody has ever seen or sit down on. It simply does not make sense. Are people really so stupid as to stay around here? So it seems. For laughing? No, this is not even worth laughing.
