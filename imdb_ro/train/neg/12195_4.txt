The plot is not so original. If someone saw "L'ultimo Bacio" is nothing new. A rich Roma family living in everyday life that is boring and false, with everyone asking others about what they think about them. Very boring after half an hour, because it's easy to understand where the story ends. This is because it is simple to see Muccino's moralistic vision in this film, so even the heaviest parts seem normal. To sum up in the first 2 minutes of the film, it would be enough and the purpose of the film has already been said. the family has seen since the age of 30, I do not like to see the movie that wants to show reality, but to be consistent with his thoughts he has to push more than normal situations. It's a good thing Muccino put the camera in the right place with a plaid and it's the only reason why I do not sleep in the cinema, though she always screamed in the movie. Maybe we should see the family as they really are and not blame anything on it. Morante was intense and great, as usual, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
