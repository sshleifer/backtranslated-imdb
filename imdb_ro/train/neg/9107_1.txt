I was mad at anyone who made this movie. I was even more upset that I lost valuable moments in my life, and I still have to look at it. I would have had a wax job and I was more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a little confused, but then I caught and figured out what was going on. At this moment the movie was half way and Yeah, I'm a procrastinator, but I always want to see things up to the end. So I stuck it and looked at everything. Not only are actors not as attractive as in gross intentions, they are not convincing. I saw my nephew weeping for more convincing attention than the alleged appetite portrayed on screen in this movie. If you like bad bad movies, watch this.
