I'm not from America and I know what Swap Swap means. When a show came out of that name, I was thrilled to see some wonderful sexual moments in the program. But what I received was a really silly sucking. I have been mistaken for his title, no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (in general, they threw Hallmark and think that they have written / moved such content to make it clean). <br /> <br /> A show that provides an insight into the current state of the American / Western family, over-populated peoples, polluted teens, and their family sufferings. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each house and to change their family routine with their new rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or even. In the finished section, each mother is brought back together with her husband and tries to conclude what they have done with each family in recent days. The party suggests the program, each of the contestants is fighting for their rights. I was aspired to see all of this instead of seeing some interesting things about adult sex. That's who makes this program, more than the one that gave the name "Wife Swap"; it is better to call it "Mother Swap". Generally, it corrupts all the wonderful things that the real Swap Wife represents! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = Show Real Reality Sucking.
