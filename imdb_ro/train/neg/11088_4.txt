This is a good movie, but it has no real depth, either emotionally or in terms of storytelling. The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, as well, no real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible in the lead, but he is sleeping walking through him, there is no possibility of flexing any muscles acting for him or his expressed support. a small apartment, even if you have never heard of the character of the end, the end was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustice, it has no emotional impact, it really does not care about the motivations of the outside helping him than he is concerned about his welfare. There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy besides the hero worshiping Carter, but this seems to be forced. It's a OK movie, but it's instantly forgotten.
