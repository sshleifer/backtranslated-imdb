I saw the film back to the first release of theater, in a theater justified by the naked. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, it still remains clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst I could afford to supervise. The actor is far below the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students on the street and forced to learn their lines 5 minutes or less. After the first shock of mistrust, I laughed for a while, each scene hit new decreases. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure was gone and it was very sad.
