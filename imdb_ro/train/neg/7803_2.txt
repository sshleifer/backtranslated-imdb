The "secretary" is one of those "thrillers" that are subject to viewing on an afternoon Sunday, when there is nothing else. While the plot (a dementia woman becomes jealous for all those who manage to do it in the office and decides to do whatever it can to stop them) could be one way, I have recognized countless overturns, probably taken from other TV films he has been subjected to for the same reason. To make things worse, I was not savage about distribution. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appear in so many television films, either as a "mother" or as a "victim" of wrong play or misconduct, that we need to ask ourselves about the way he lives. In this case, she gets the joy of playing a mother and a victim of secretary psychologist Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and Cred, Law and Order), she is also surrounded by a number of honest roles of TV movies, and she just adds to her. As for the others, I do not have clear memories of them, so I have to say something. It will play on the Lifetime network (I think I saw it), but no You do not mind to look if you are not too bored of words. Not that it will make you more excited ...
