Well, you have to give the director gratitude for how nice he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people, but he also decided to use special sub-par with a heavy and boring plot, and he did not joke, the beginning of the movie you could have fun! However, they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a frightening creepy gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unic-aaawwwwnnn .... If you look at Mystery Science Theater 3000, you might have seen that. They love to show up horrible movies just to make you known. A good gift for someone you hate.
