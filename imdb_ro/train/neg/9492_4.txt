A star for "plot". A star for acting. A star for dubbing the Americans out loud. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with the tendency to take off their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before doing "Manon des sources". Béart is also stripped several times, but even fully dressed her presence is enough to make this film forever. Watch out for the scene where she tells her girlfriend about the three "prime times" for a girl. It is corny, but still more heroic than love scenes "with love" that were presented by Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. In fact, cinema is not great; shelter for closing credits is a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
