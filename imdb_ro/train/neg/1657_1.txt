This movie was worth five strokes on the "hurter card". I saw this while I was in Virginia in the mid-70s. I saw her alone, so I was not distracted as I watched her. It was sucked. It was the most ridiculous and total celluloid waste I've ever seen. I know others who have analyzed this movie thought it was wonderful. I give this to you: would it have been so wonderful what the boxer got? The end of the discussion.
