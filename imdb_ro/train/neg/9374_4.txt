This documentary is the best one when it simply shows the offices of Ayurvedic healers and the preparation of the treatment. There is no denial of poverty in India and the despair of even the richest clients. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails. Although Indian clients say they saw the "aleopathic" doctors, these doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take their patients' vague claims at face value - "the doctor said there was no cure," the doctor said it was cancer, etc. "Well," no treatment "does not mean" no treatment ", and what type of cancer does the patient have? The film is the weakest when presenting an Ayurvedic practice in America, apparently reducing the suggestion of stunning a high-powered job on Wall Street can make you sick of the stomach.
