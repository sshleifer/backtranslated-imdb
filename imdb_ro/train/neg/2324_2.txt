I agree with the other users' comments that the two main roles were well acting, being the guy who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. I did not hear about the story I did not know about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Walkman or Room, but how wrong I was. The whole movie simply spoke, spoke and talked about Mom and Dad. The only interesting scenes were the flashbacks in which the father lost his fears. This was the only interest I received from this borefest.
