Dil was a memorable film that brings celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The film followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all of them superb. But then every successful director gives some horrible movies over time with a few hits. Pyare Mohan is such a movie. Although comedies are nice, but then the spectator can not laugh. By comparing with the kind of comedy movies that are being made today, this is a fool. If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not look at it. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only. In short, the movie deserves a wish.
