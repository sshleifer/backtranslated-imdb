Lately, they are trying to swallow this movie late at night on cable TV commercials. Do not believe the hype. I was one of those unhappy to see this stinker in the theater. This is, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all times, right behind Mac & Me (# 1 worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 worst), but I have to admit I'm almost all TERRIBLE! Indeed, nothing in this movie is funny or disturbing, or anything else is supposed to be so you do not lose money. The only thing for which it is good is for the one who gives the worst enemy. I'm not lying about it. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film. It's so terrible. If you do not believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery to follow this, which I doubt you can finish. Two minds enthusiastically down.
