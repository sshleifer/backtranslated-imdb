I have to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to save their money. Almost any episode of Desmond Morris "Human Animal" or David Suzuki, "The Nature of Things", could have countered the material presented. The director fails to make use of the incredible 65-70 mm IMAX movies and the giant display screen, everything on the screen is extremely unimpeded, given the affordability of such a programming. The audience is present at a pregnant woman, Heather, her husband Buster, to her niece and nephew. We follow them for an endless minute of forty minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive tract and learn about the natural diving reflexes of children, do we really learn a little more than most school leavers? Are we even distracted from the transatlantic Heather? We care? Avoid this movie at any cost. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest your nice picture "India: Tiger Kingdom" or "Space Station 3D" from a technical point of view. Trust me.
