I can not believe that someone thought there was something original or interesting about this movie. I am a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy and I can even enjoy old movies with ridiculous premises as long as they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my brilliant review of the Altered States [1980].) A monkey could have explained better why I should seriously take the basic idea behind this film. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - it is they did not care. Now, to humiliate publicly worthless magazines whose brilliant comments appear on the box: Chicago Tribune San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the last two .. However, their review of credibility movie has gone by word, but I know if I ever make a movie with portable camera, a brown plot and stupid effects , I will show them to the journalists and remind them what they have said about the Ada Conception.)
