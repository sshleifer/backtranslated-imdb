I'll keep fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a soccer match decide to take a "shortcut" to lead them on a deserted forest road. Of course, nothing but good things happen and they get safely to their destination. Okay, they did not. Soon they are hunted by a disturbed cat that has severe mental problems and what results is 90 minutes of pure boredom. I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie. Their shrieking and screaming voices gave me a headache and the script was so badly written that it contained a lot of repeated phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming. Generally, one of the biggest cheap horror movements I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
