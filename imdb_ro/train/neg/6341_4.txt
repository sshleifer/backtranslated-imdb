The Eastern Palace, the West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra as the policeman, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I believe, but it perpetuates myths about gay men's femininity: there are many Chinese myths in which men take female roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and hurt by a typical macho. He cuts the park without fear - hopes to be taken to the officer's office. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to light torture: making himself sit for a while, dressed, slapped. This is what homosexual man wants and, implicitly, homosexual man provokes the self-image of the policeman as a man man. The story of gay life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when it begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a pity for China's homosexuals, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can not relate.
