There seems to be a surprisingly large number of 8-10 star reviews from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since. Given the very low average of other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. This is a very bad movie. I'll admit, I thought the concept was kind of sweet and I was thrilled to see the actress who played Eve and Harmony on Angel, but it did not take too long to make this movie terribly familiar. <br /> <br /> Action: The conductors seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: A road full of holes big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Directia: Inexistenta. I think people will laugh? Guys. Glasses: OK. In this movie there were really beautiful women. Not just the three main female characters, but everywhere. It was as if the producers hope the landscape will keep the male spectators so entertained that they will not see how terrible anything is. If so, they failed miserably. In the right hands it could have been classically classic but cute but funny. It was not even close.
