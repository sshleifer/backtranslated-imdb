We are not in the emperor's fairy tale empty. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being fools, we confess that this show is incomprehensible in many ways, and that it is clear that much of it has been created from a pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <br /> Well obviously, many people like these things. I do not know. I prefer well-thought out and planned preferences. And I confess that the show is very serious for my taste and boring ... those love and drug stories ... There are so many exciting soaps with lots of suspense (for example, Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not get my attention. I do not care about those people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
