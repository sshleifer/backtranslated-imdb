It's like other Dracula movies always do, Dracula's servants always on Dracula's side, which disappointed me at the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first film that the minion is fighting against his master. It is very interesting (since you can predict almost how the story goes) than just his priest or D wins the game (we need some surprising plots!).
