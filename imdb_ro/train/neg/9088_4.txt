It has been said many times - not least by me - that watching a movie by Eric Rohmer is as if he were seeing the dry paint; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer doubts this (he does not deny, but how can he, he just resents him) so much that his new film, which may be his last, Inch Allah, the time it's like watching dry. The wonderful ones who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already called him one of the best movies in 2007 to give you some ideas. The reality is not raised on Rohmer's agenda, so in France in the 5th century, we have at the extreme a castle that would not be absent in the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is a rustic wooden cottage. The story involves nymphs and shepherds, and often Rohmer threw it with strangers who have just passed, so the overall effect is that the annual classroom play at a school for pupils with special needs was captured on an accidental film. One is almost tempted to say, "Go back Godard, everything is forgiven," but even this terrible production can not make me speak these words.
