This movie is worth watching if you like to marvel at special effects. There are some interesting visual effects. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, it is typical of the ninety / hollywood aughties fare effect of blindness, no substance. True with the title. It's not worth destroying the story. It's like performing a surgery on a dinosaur. It's not too much to start with. There is nothing original and not very special. So, do not go into the story at all. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, I understood a bit ostentatious at the end of the year, diluting the purity of FX treatment by the invisible man (and sometimes invisible half). However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnic effects, it is a view of looking (or not seeing). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a decent FX movie worth seeing for that and only purpose.
