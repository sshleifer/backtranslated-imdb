I like sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, considering these parameters, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever. Is not. The monster looks like a villain at the Power Rangers, and has about the same range of rubber moves. This could be fine if the manufacturers were not as proud of its design, as it seems. I mean, for a guy in a big rubber suit, in an action / scifi / horror action that could benefit from some mysteries, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. Granted, it is usually shocking and irregular. I think you should assume it's so scary that even the room type gets angry. The room goes to a person about to be eaten, the room goes to the shark. The device returns to the person to be eaten, only screaming and fighting. And so on. The costume is bad, the action is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely random so that more people can be eaten, or something can explode. Because it saves you, the people who made this movie have certainly entered with more explosions = better mentality. Characters pull cars and there's a massive explosion. They pull helicopters, there's a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, ALL, all explode, so much that the crazy shark even explodes at the end. Speaking of which, I do not care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that someone would think that trying to make a giant half a person half a shark is having sex with a woman in order to make strange shark kids baby is a good idea. That is, if this person is not the crazy scientist in this movie. The bad thing is that the movie is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its evil is not really enough to prolong the person's interest. It might be good at MST3K with your friends, but eventually, if you're gonna catch this bad guy, do a favor and change the channel.
