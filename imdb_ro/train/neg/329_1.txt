First of all: I bought it at the video store. Second: I looked at her. Third: it was boring. Fourth: It was not funny. Fifth, most of the ancients were cowards. And last but not least: it's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. I'm a great fan of Adam Sandler, despite this disappointed and forgotten film. I'm sorry because it was his first film. Even if you are a huge Adam Sandler fan, do not bother to watch this movie. Instead, take a video, embark a yacht and throw it overboard.
