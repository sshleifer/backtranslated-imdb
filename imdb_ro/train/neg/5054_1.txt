We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: a very small number of people would provoke. The friends and family of these and other people who died in attacks on the International Trade Center could be well moved by this filmed movie. A sweet, serious, though tongued firefighter, remembers what can be done from colleagues lost to a journalist who turns his fragments into an eulogy. They take into account the results. Mumbles more, composes another eulogy, etc. and so on The terrible events that have prompted the need for many thousands of eulogies are overwhelmingly sad, but this insatiable drama is tangled with boredom.
