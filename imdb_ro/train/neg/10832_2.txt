Normally, I do not have a problem with free movies in swearing, but that really made me angry. All they did was swear. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else noticed, get cancer) It was boring, rambling and pretentious. I would not want it to be me. <br /> <br /> It's also not like I do not like movies that, like most people who like it, will claim 'respect for life'. I like to eat a man-woman drink, and all that happens in this is the fact that a load of people in Taiwan are living their lives. But I could refer to them. I have never met someone who swore as much as the "actors" in this movie and worked on a construction site. So you run. After I said that William H. Macy made me grin. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid if you do not enjoy the tedium.
