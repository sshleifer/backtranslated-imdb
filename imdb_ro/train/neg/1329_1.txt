This movie is AWFUL. I have not laughed so much at a movie that has been unintentionally funny for a long time. Leno should have stood up and sat up late at night. The cars in the movie were cold, but the movie itself is the worst movie I've ever seen. is pathetic, the act is horrible, and the plot could have been written by a four-year old. do not get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie!
