Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super-government computer designed to describe potential terrorists, follows him because he will borrow some money from his neighbor's bank account to hack pay a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia. The next neighbor whose computer Will was settling, has relatives in the middle east, who through their bank sends money to his neighbor's bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to turn to missile strikes. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster and more aggressive rhythm than the War Games in the early 1980s. Well, the electronics industry has a lot more to do with these days. Makes sense. So, the movie amazes us with fantastic CGIs on computer screens, and once Joshua, the precursor Ripley, is found operational, I kept watching the computer against the computer and people are sluggish, hopefully, praying. Well, OH-oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more sluggishly hoping things will go their way. In other words, we are now faced with a movie type made for television, and it's Oh Hum time. Go back in the 1980s and watch the original War Games. It is much better. But, we really have to ask: do our computers too smart if one day, in time, they will reign? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
