Mr. Perlman offers exceptional performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight a script and a number of countless pieces. Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode full of singlet and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could do better, but he seems pleased to grimace and swallow in his side. Lovely Erika is very decorative (even if completely dressed!) And shows some signs of "getting", which ultimately acts. <br /> <br /> SFX are mostly poor CGIs and steals from other movies. Shootouts are wretched - worthy of A-Team <br /> <br /> It's not even worth seeing it for Perlman - AVIOAT
