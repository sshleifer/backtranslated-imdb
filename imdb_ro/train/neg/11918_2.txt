This seemed to be a good film, I thought it would be a good film and in the whole movie I hope it will be a significant use of my time and I must admit that the talent of action of Dimple Kapadia and Naval Deepts where is really commendable, but despite the best effort, this film fails to effectively transmit a meaningful message, which seems to be what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point is short and the end seems rather unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like the real life in this respect, but the films, unlike real life, end in about two hours, and the conclusion should leave the audience happy, if indeed this is the intention of the director. This does not fit in this, and that disappoints me the most. Another aspect that looked at me was the national stereo-typing of American characters - all seem to be carved from the same block. It seems to me that most of the American characters in English Indian movies are based on how ordinary Indians perceive Americans as being and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie. /> <br /> These two aspects put together make it a disappointing story.
