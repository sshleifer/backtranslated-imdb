That could have been a great movie if I could see it. The hand room was very bouncy. From the opening credits I was worried. Some of us have seen that he felt very tough until the end. But we have remained to the end, because it was such a charming and exciting film, giving it insight into the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film has improved the sensation of art. The act seemed very authentic. Some of the dialogues were somewhat difficult to understand, but a theater full of Africans outside the South seemed to find the most amusing part. However, if you have a bad move, you can take this movie seriously. It's weird but it's not worth the nausea.
