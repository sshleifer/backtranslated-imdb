I'm starting to write this review during a break while watching the movie. It's the first time I tried to do this, but I have trouble going through it without occasional breaks. That's not because it's intense, but because it's bad. It's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when Ryan's dead brother Brom (Colm Feore) is on the screen being tragic and angry, self-indulgent and self-pitying. That would have been a better movie if he'd just left that character in the story. He adds nothing but the mawkish melodrama, maudlin, very irritating. Perhaps someone has decided that if they can not make Ryan credible, it would have done him wrong. The problem with who he is: Who cares if a spoiled, weeping and weary scumbag dies? Not only me. The only thing this character has for him is that he dies and I'm sorry, but that's not enough. Dies does not make anyone special. Everything dies, sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while acting like a bastard. The other two characters and the actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pity, would have made a much better film. But it's not over yet and it's time to re-enter PLAY. Maybe something big happens before the end .... No. Sorry. This rented leprechaun is going tonight!
