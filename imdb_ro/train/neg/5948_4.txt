I will not mention any plot anymore, because it would be highly predictable anyway, a remarkable twist of the plot is given everywhere, in the comments of the film, in the summary of the plot and even in the synopsis of the Netflix envelope. I could have enjoyed more if I did not know that. May be. This film has a misleading expression, many of which act credibly with rather limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but that was obvious by design. And there were some quick nude scenes by Callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of these brings the slightest recommendation on my part. None of these French actors actually read these scriptures before signing?
