This is a cut in the notorious Guinea Pig series. A short-lived Japanese television show that was canceled after a psychopath admitted that it was inspired to kill a schoolgirl. This short series is, like all other movies in the series, practically without a story. A group of guys captured a young woman. They tie her down and continue to torture her to death while she's a videotape. They beat it, poured boiling oil over it, used pliers on it, and finally, in "love" nearby, pushing the needle through the eyes. This is the simplest of all the films in Guinea Pig, and one of the first. Perhaps this film, more than any other, gave Guinea Pig the rumor that it was suspected. They surely inspired Nicolas Cage's "8 mm" movie. These films have become quite popular in horror circles. They turned to more polished, but as graphic as Naked Blood. It probably fills the void left by Mondo, which has been easily cleaned up and has become real television. It is not recommended, but it will probably attract those who will see something once and wonder why, after that, I know I did.
