There are many good things about this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, full of color and full of beautiful details made by deco art. The animation is at the usual standards of time studios, which are undoubtedly higher than the present ones. However, I find it boring for several reasons. Music: It's definitely not Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although it is supposed to evoke a set of "Great Gatsby," it becomes frightening, sleepy, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotone are not the same, as the 5th Symphony of Beethoven shows). Because most people (including myself) tend to close their eyes when they get married, there is much visible part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer. Story: I'm not revealing any secrets that are not already in the summary of the plot - good country, bad town. This is a common theme in the animated and live films of this era. It is a bad nostalgia for a non-existent rural idyll, which is now reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values" that have never been.
