Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was close. It was such a bad movie, a real and interesting story. She had such a promise, but the act was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something in a theme park. I woke up laughing when I looked, as it should have been, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the struggle between friends who ended with the death of the "king." I liked the Queens punishment. But the last chance made a beautiful picture. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
