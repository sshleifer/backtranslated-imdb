Neither Bob Hope, escorted by a bunch of exceptional character actors, can save this badly written attempt at the war comedy, as his patented time has little to do. The film involves a Hollywood star, called Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to escape military service at the start of World War II, followed by his enlistment in a confusing attempt to judge a colonel daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, join with him and the three are involved in various training escapades filmed in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount beat handsome for this effort, engaging some of his top specialists, but David Butler's routine, reliable, direction was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comic element in the script. A change towards the end of the film to create a heroism opportunity by Bolton is still born with a bad stunt work and action of the room as proof. Strange, Lynne Overman has the best lines, and this veteran master of the sniper is doing very well with them. Dorothy Lamour looks wonderful and behaves beautifully, and it's always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or on the radio, but there is little to save this movie, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment.
