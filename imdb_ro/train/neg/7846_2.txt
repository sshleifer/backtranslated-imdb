You know, I went to see "Hills have eyes 2" that they want to like. I enjoyed the original, and the remake was quite fun. They obviously had more money than Wes Craven did for special effects a second time. Even if I still prefer the original movie, the remake has been done well and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. What brings us to "The Hills Have eyes 2". Man, where do I start? Plot, or lack of one, is thin paper. We are not really breaking a new land here. The soldiers have decided to monitor the area and all these people prove to be deprived. So what do we do now? Send the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion we have to make them the ruthless and worst soldiers ever seen. Gee, I've never seen this premise. To make a brief short story, you have mutants killing moron soldiers one by one graphically. Once again, the special effects of Nicotero are wonderful, but they kill no matter how graphically it becomes boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this move was made only to take a quick dollar. It was bloody and graphic, but I realized it was predictable, boring and not scary. For me, it would have been nice if this movie contained an original thought. Wes Craven and his son shared the writing duties and was involved in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately this is not one of them.
