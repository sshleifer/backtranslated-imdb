This film did not offer anything new or worthwhile. After seeing her, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply did this and that it could have taken less care if it was fun. This is a good example of a "concept only" movie - they have a concept about a movie, and the other details are inconsequential, because executives know it will only rely on the original concept. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cruella's jailbreak and passage to passwords. She no longer hates puppies, but she was scheduled to adore them - she just could not hurt a flea. It does not take long after its release and returns to its old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the film were supporting characters. Eric Idle, like Waddlesworth's voice, the bird made me kill him - and that's TOUGH thinking I'm a rough Python fan. It was obvious that he did this because he gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's self-esteem, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder shows, but here he is completely wasted and unhappy. And it must have cost a few dollars to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he was wasted. There were other actors who support, but considering how bad the characters were, I tried to block them from my mind. In general, you'd better just let your children watch TV rather than let them see them.
