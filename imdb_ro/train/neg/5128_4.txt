This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous couple Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but must wait a good time before taking a look, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who are barely comprehending but have to mobilize in front of the attack. I saw Sanders like so many nice presents that it was fun to witness a good evil. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is quite a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but I always felt he'd just appeared, smiling, under a car, covered with fat and a sixth degree of education. Some people like it, like the character of the Gypsy Queen Gene. This is an adventure action filler material, Tho, and as we were warned to invade the locals with weapons, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, there is a final battle weapon in which we must lose a character main for good of all. This feature requires nothing more than barest attention on an afternoon afternoon, a programmer who did anything else has been associated with the better. It was almost more interesting to identify high-profile support and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of his first roles. Two or two and a half stars. - MDM
