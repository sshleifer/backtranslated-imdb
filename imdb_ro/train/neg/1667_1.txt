I really liked this movie to the end. Sure, it was camouflaged and unlikely, but it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. By the end, that's it. For her final performance at the prestigious classic conservatory, where she fought to understand the other students trained in the classroom, what does the main character do? Wow her with her understanding and execution of this time honored the musical tradition? Not. Tortures and slaughters the great sensual Habanera from Carmen and turns it into a Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song forgotten. My ears blew! And, at the height of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher who is not in a fantasy induced by Spears would not have succeeded on the spot. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
