It's hard to criticize this movie because I do not like the story itself and no good action would save it. Think of "Raising Arizona" with an average string. The actress is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly is above the top (but not enough to make this beautiful movie movie) as usual, coming somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has eyebrows permanently knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or from the stress of the whole unnecessary exercise. A few hours of real movie degradation. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it was over, but I went out, I'm sorry.
