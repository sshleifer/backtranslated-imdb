Can I give a minus rating? Not? Well, let me say this is the most harsh film I've ever tried to see. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. Plot (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I hired this movie with a friend, and after about thirty minutes of hope that it would improve, we decided to "go ahead" a little to see if things would improve. It does not get better. This movie about a guy who was kidnapped by these two girls seems exciting, but in reality it's just a boredom. Nothing really interesting from afar is ever happening. If you ever have the chance to follow this, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NINE FROM SPACE EXTERIOR".
