This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an incontestable error in his story. While dealing with Ralphie's situation, Christopher says he has heard of Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. There is, however, no possibility that Chris has heard of the accident. Who should have told him and when? Until he is torn from his delirium by calling Tony, no one else has been informed. Tony knows this - which is even worse! Hearing Christopher talking about the death of Pie-O-My, he could only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself had set the fire. Given the elaborate writing process, as the DVD writers told them, it really asks me that none of them made the issue there. The story does not work that way. I do not need to add that I am a great fan of the Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly would not care.
