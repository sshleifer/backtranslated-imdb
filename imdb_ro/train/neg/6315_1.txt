This sexy, sexy movie is a must-see. Only after multiple views one can really understand the uniqueness of this film. I personally liked the narrator for his intelligent, no subject that remained untouched, a narrative style. The introduction tightens you upright and keeps you at the edge of the chair throughout the movie. It offers wonderful views of the train world and allows the audience to really "connect" with the inner horror this movie poses. The script itself keeps the movie together awesome. Not only for children, but also for the elderly will be better understood the modern training and understanding they have on sexual experience. Before his time, and fierce in cinema, he definitely defines the word "masterpiece".
