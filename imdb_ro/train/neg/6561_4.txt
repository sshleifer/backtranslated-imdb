The opening sequence should show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 November 1918. Troops gather their train - wearing the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, started at war in 1914! This sign sure the warfare you are about to see is going to be a turkey. (The French army did not work until 1915 that the war with red trousers and dark blue clothes did not work.) The French metropolitan troops were put in the "blue sky" and the colonial troops were put in khaki.) Claude Van-Damme sp) the remake received at least the uniforms more or less well. It's really too bad when executives make such mistakes when they make every effort to get other things right.
