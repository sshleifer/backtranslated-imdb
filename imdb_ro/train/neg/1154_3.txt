May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay a seemingly unusual visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers a myocardial infarction, letting May realize it, unsafe, and ask his life and his future. Finding her daughter's lover, Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences. Lovely filmed, but for all her realism and recognition, Mother offers a most unpleasant collection to reject the characters and ask the spectator to engage with them. Reid shines in May, and her talent and commitment is like a great understated actor who saves the film from a dirty depression, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such unpleasant characters , hard to care what is happening with May. As it is written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are, in fact, so selfish and cold, that they start wondering exactly what Kureishi tried to say. As they were justified, they either do not want or can not lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensions in their frightening selfishness. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing Reid's performance, but a little more. A cry of shame ...
