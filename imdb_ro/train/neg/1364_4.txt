the more I think about it, there was nothing to redeem about this film. I saw it 9 months ago, so my memory could have done worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 <br /> <br /> 10. <br / > <br /> After seeing the movie, I met the director. he seemed so clueless about what he was doing or what he had done and, as far as I could tell him, he did not even care about the movie. he even agreed that he did not really know what he was doing and he was forced to do certain things because he was filmed digitally. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was trying to fit hard with the formula it built: "9 people have to be connected in a way. We can get from point 'A' to point 'B' "to get from the prostitute we see at the beginning and back to her at the end of her 10 minutes on the relationship of each character with another person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> Moreover, Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi is a scene in which he is amazing. that's it. I say it 4 out of 10.
