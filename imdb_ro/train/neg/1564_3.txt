... it was so, in good conscience, I could tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I've barely managed twenty minutes before I think of myself: "Wow, it's really bad." And, honestly, I would have given a 1-star movie if it had not been for Esai Morales (although it had very little screen time). He is the only well-played part of the movie, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. As I look at this, I began to think of her role in "Shawshank Redemption," and I realized it was not as good as I thought it was. The problem: its prison / torture act seems to be like an act; his dialogue sounds like he would make a very poor impression. Has he ever met anyone who talks about his character being SURFACE? I doubt it, but maybe it should. And to make things worse, they managed to inject a little prison philosophy and look no controversial, especially when you think the rhetoric was shattered by a "rasta" that emphasized it so strong it seemed be unnatural. Normally, I would not kick a movie like this, but when I saw the movie, a favorable review. I felt like I was cheated and lied and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of watching this movie. I say BOOOOOOOO.
