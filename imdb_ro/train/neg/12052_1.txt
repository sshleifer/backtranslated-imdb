What happens when you give a free man just enough money to catch him in the rat race and follow him? Homeless people do not respond to anyone. They do not have mortgages, rent or idiot bosses. Homeless people do not need to worry about IRS or performance ratings or credit card payments. But give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly you have to worry about getting into the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance on their car and working for someone else. They have a chance to be "productive citizens." This movie was just as exploitable as a movie can be. It's a way of telling the rich and middle class class "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and it justifies capitalist arrogance. Why not a movie that asks: "What happens when you take everything a rich man has?"
