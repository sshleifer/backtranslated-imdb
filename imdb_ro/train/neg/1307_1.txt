It was really a really bad movie. I am a great fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here, Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two "Demons" movies to be extremely fun - they were so bad they were great, but that's just so bad that it's really really bad. It's boring, the story never goes away and I hated the characters - the husband and the husband who gnawed your husband and soul, the pain of the child in my wife *** made me crazy, was not anywhere close to the Ogre story that was probably the best actor in the entire movie. I turned off about three-quarters of the way, because I was very, very born! Not disturb.
