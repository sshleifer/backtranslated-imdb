Give me a generous four out of ten stars, points or bookmarks or something like that. There were a total of two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear!) Have really moved quite comfortably. Otherwise, the usual stereotype traffic, lighted speed, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really funny scenes involved Amy P. She's just very hilarious in some kind of animal. She is a mix of that monkey man who makes SNL and Lucille Ball. I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) have just admitted they did this for the money, because if she did give birth to Sarah Palin's parodies, then I think we can say, yes, it's worth to put on black in the role of the servant who is really there to help you become more humane. <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10 as I said is generous. But they're not girls anymore, okay? I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie and she has a plastic surgery, so her mouth now looks like a 30-year-old mouth, so that every scene she's in, we can rearrange her face or to put it in mind or answer the question: "No, wait, wait, did a plastic surgery?" Because, as a spectator, you really do not want her to have a plastic surgery.
