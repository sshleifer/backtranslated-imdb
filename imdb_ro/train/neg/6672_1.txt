I am 47 years old and I spent as much of my life as a fan of horror films and SF. Whether silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, very few of them do not find anything to please. That being said, I will give this credit movie for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. This is a case of effects on the story. The truth is that we live at a time when there is not much left that was not seen in a horror movie. Therefore, for a movie of any kind to really have fun, it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and act badly, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie does not even have a good effect, just good effects. So, if you can not just talk about the gore, move it on.
