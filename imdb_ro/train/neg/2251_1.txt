Really a bunch of popes! A predictable, blurry film, destroying the soul, the suffocating film, to which you cut your wrists with a rusty bread knife, seems almost necessary. <br /> <br /> It works on the thin dialogue, each scene has at least twice as much as it should, the complicated details of how this career collapses or this career is growing is far too disturbing and trivial for words. Music would be good if you did not have to stay in the movie, but really three good songs are not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie. Watching this movie I prayed to God for narcolepsy or someone to shoot me. Never, never, never.
