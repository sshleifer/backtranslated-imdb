At least I managed to enjoy the film that is surprising since I could barely stand by it. With all sincerity, we assume that DVD coverage costs more than the entire movie. And saying he's the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version came out ... cute boys, it was pretty deceptive to break me inside. The only thing that frustrated me more than the unbearable act of copying was his haircut. Usually, you only see that hair type on a ten-year-old boy and the character acted like that. The film seems to have been shot by a D + grade student of a movie school delighted to use every film technique she has ever learned during her classes ... sometimes she is less friendly. Beyond me I would have lost by random plotting that did not go anywhere or were not unexplainable. All of this makes a bad movie, but when the end of the demise does not come close, it makes it an extremely bad film. Undoubtedly, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and that includes my French final video of my friends for the last year of high school, but maybe I'm a little bit biased, so I had to play an extra. P.S. I do not even think it deserves a star ... not even half. Nothing for you!
