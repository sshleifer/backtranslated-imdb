Friday third step! There is a movie worse than your ugly series there. I won this movie in a college competition and it was a waste of money even if it was free. Jack Jones plays the role of a really horrible singer, whose attempt is to find some killers or something like that. At least on Friday, the thirteenth did not bore me. I prefer to remove my nails to see again.
