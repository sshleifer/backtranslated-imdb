Please help save money - spend your money elsewhere! The film's synopsis is: The First Lady has her assassinated husband because he deceives him. That's it. Although she was not discovered by anyone except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a vast murder conspiracy that no one knows ... and is completely free of charge. Some specific points are particularly hilarious: Cuba and Angie watch the movie in a news room and see ... a clue. Cuba and Angie watch the movie from a news room, and I see ... a clue. They strive to protect the film, believing they are the only ones to have a copy of this very public film. Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member. PSM commented that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that more people were involved. The PSM then claims that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. God, I wonder that PSM is involved. Mrs. Archer, the first lady, is a crafty artist. Cuba can not make a painting and says, "You're too close ... stay back ... look at a different perspective, look at my perspective." Can anyone miss this clue?
