"The Attack of the Killers Tomatoes" consists largely of a shit movie, assembled badly in search of a movie. Plot makes no sense, and the different characters descend and go out of the picture without any explanation. Watching this deep paradise, you feel how many other comments have captured so precisely: it's easy to make a cheap and low quality movie and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for cheap and low-quality scenes, swimmers are frightened by the tomatoes floating near them, how far can "mistrust" - even in a parody? However, the title song is great. (* 1/2)
