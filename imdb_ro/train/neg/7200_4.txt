I really liked to like this movie - the location photos were mostly shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some great pictures. But even for a filmed cartoon, it was a very bad film made. Continuity and rhythm were so terrible. The best bits in the movie are under the final credits, so it's worth it (almost) to stick it to the end (though weird it rises slightly over the last half hour or so). /> When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know it must be a problem ...
