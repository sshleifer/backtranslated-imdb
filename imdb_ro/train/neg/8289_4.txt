I'm sorry, but it's such a stupid movie that it's hilarious. Do the hooligans' football stand in a hut? Costumes? Shades?! Alan had no idea what he was talking about when he did, he is as far from the truth you can get. Casting was atrocious ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? Does not seem scary, does not behave frighteningly, or even meets like someone who wants football. And for Yeti? What the hell? Costumes, shades and sessions in a childhood trip that tease each other with "once you put on your diaper". Please. Yeti's band that sprays the ICC lingerie? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can really take this movie seriously! 4/10. Perhaps the most inaccurate representation of the 1980s hooliganism that I have ever seen.
