Well, I hate hollywood, but I love the cinema, so I have to watch those terrible movies in the theaters. And we hoped the Vanilla Sky would be good. We hope to keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, whether it be their own. Well, it happened to be a bit of both, and sucked. It started well. I like Radiohead. I wish it was more than that. But, after all, we listen to the good vibes of the beach boys. Discuss a wide range of infants between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a few others, but why should they have ignited GV during the climax. It was more annoying than confusing or flagrant. Especially when it has nothing to do with PLOT. At least put a meaning behind the songs. Kid A = Primary. Anyway. He also did a job at the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise, the movie was a big ball of arrogance. Like the audience would get the movie. Those who would have read his subtitles, and the rest do not. It's as simple as that. The motives worsened. I did not understand Diaz's motivations (never did with chicken soup?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in these types of movies [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I see. Anyway, they tried to improve their original with an American rock rock soundtrack and bad angles and good film and glossy processing and would have helped her if the croup would not have cheated it. 2/10 Major disappointment.
