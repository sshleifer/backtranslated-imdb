This is the story of a young woman seduced and then thrown by her older lover, married after she gets pregnant; does he rush against him and his whole family through black magic? which, disappointingly, is not done, but it does somebody else for her. Good production value for a Thai Thai movement. But the script never produces suspense, the director approaches the material in the usual way, and the final act loses the viewer's sympathy for the victims by throwing logic in the winds. At one point, a character has the first opportunity to simply shoot the dead witch, and instead rises and runs without picking up the gun. Bad writing? Dive into it! Some gicky gore effects, including a truly dead-bodied, dead body, and a guy who died from hundreds of live eagles, came out of the stomach. It's only recommended for genre artists who just have to watch every horror film produced in Asia over the past 15 years.
