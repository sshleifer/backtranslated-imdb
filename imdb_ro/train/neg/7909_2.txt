Incredible! This movie gets 7 out of 10. This movie has to be one of the worst movies I've seen over the years. not just acting incredibly bad, the story (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Of course, everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience while you are performing until that moment. However, this is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately, it was a waste of my time and certainly a loss of my money. <br /> <br /> And the two just to try
