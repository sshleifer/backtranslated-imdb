I actually prefer Robin Williams to his more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The King Fisher, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite films Robin Williams. But, "Seize the Day" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst movie Robin Williams (even worse than Smoochy's Death, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). Every good story will have ups and downs. This film, however, is a giant down. I do not need a simple hollywood candy, but I have to have 90 minutes of total and total perfection. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems the only point in the movie is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
