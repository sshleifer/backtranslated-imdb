I personally discovered this movie as terrible, first that it was not at all objective and provided it was part of the debate. The only people who were present as part of saying there was a bunch of people coming from a Revival Billy Grahm. Secondly, he deviated very much from his supposed subject, that there was Jesus (Yeshua), to talk about how violent Christianity is and to show scenes from Mel Gibsons "Passion." Finally, his director, with his former director of a conservative private school, was interviewed and tries to catch him with the teaching of the children there. And Techno Music has just made the movie harder to watch.
