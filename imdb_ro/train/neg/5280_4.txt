Chris, a son of a moral family, a loser who works at the school newspaper with Kate (Christine Lakin of TGIF's "Step by Step" great performance of sugar, now thankful for ABC's defeat), finds he's just inherited a porn empire from its biological parents. He loses sight of what is true friendship and love, and blah blah some other nonsense. He also has to fight a uncle who wants control over his family business and a lawyer (who is not?). An adolescent comedy that is a little under the average, stealing from better comedies for teenagers (opening alone is HIGHLY American Pie-esquire), you get bored with the moral head you get and lose your only talent (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I really have the word Star, Martin Starr about "Freaks and Geeks" and Justin Berfield from "Malcolm in the middle"). It's not exactly bad, but it's far from good. Candy Eyes: Some Extras Are Topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> When I See It: Starz on Demand (Available until Sept. 29)
