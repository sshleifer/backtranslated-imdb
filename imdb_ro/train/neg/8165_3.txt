It's a ghost story. It's a story about cannibalism. It's a revenge story. It's a very bad film, done with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows inexpensively according to every movie you've ever seen. It has its usual isolated place, the tumultuous campsite, heading for the wilderness. Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's so boring. Inappropriate editing and all work. There are ghost kids who sound like they are talking in a trash can. I'm not really sure what ghosts and sex-headed psychics are doing. It also has the rough scene in which a man eats a piece of meat that is actually what's left of his wife. A friend once asked me why we need to show this kind of free, sick violence. I'm afraid it's just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three are not here, no tongue in the cheek, just a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; small plot.
