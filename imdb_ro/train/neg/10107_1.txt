Last week I bought this zombie movie from the shopping cart and watched with some friends who thought it would be a budget version of "Land of the Dead". Well, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems they have spent a large part of their budget on the cover, which is very deceptive for fans of the zombie genre. I traced to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get into the car with some yuppie that is in the middle of nowhere, talking business on a cell phone. They actually talk to the guy before one of the girls kill him; but once they started driving, I could no longer suspend my suspicion. Some people think this is a "so bad, good" movie, they are a liar. We have not finished the movie, but one of the other reviews mentions that in a sense they become, in a way, police officers at the end of the film, which makes me happy that I have not watched it until now. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT PLEASE!
