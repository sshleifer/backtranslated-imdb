I've never seen a movie in so little time. The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD drive. It was like watching a badly produced CBC movie. There was obviously money for lighting, filming, sets, location, scriptwriters, publishers, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write ten lines of commentary ... Bad, terrible, horrible, miserable, dizzy, hoarse, bileous, nauseous, ill, angry, disgusting, disgusting, villainous, dirty, dirty, and do not know if I can continue to finish all ten lines of how bad was that piece of carp-o-matic production!
