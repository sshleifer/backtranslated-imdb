This is not a good review because I did not see the majority of the movie. I have not looked. The film is very violent, with cute drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching. Here was the problem: I looked long enough to be presented to several characters, they were not interesting. Everyone was a boring and contemptuous psychopath, without appealing personalities, without giving me anything to expect. I did not even wonder what she would do next or what might happen to her. If there was even a person of interest and I do not mean to say a good or nice person, I mean, an interesting person, I could have stayed with her. Follow the "Grace Condition" to see what I mean. In this movie, Gary Oldman's character is a complete madman, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino probably did a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not hire me.
