"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German director Wim Wenders. Many felt it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it perfectly clear; not only did Wenders lose it, it actually turned into a BAD director, creating stories and very thin and superficial scenes. One might argue that "time is lost" comes to each director, but Wenders "the case is extreme. It's as if he completely forgets everything he knew about the cinema and started again - just to get quick results. a few words, this movie is not worth your time.
