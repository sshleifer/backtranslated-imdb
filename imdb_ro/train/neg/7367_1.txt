I really begin to think that Seagal is on a mission to see how strong his films can become. This movie was a complete and complete loss of time to see. My first complaint was covering the DVD, making it look thinner and younger when it looks like a carp in this movie. He has a big pot of stomach and a double beard for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face. The whole plot was ridiculous to start and it was too long. The whole movie led to the end, where Seagal and his team had to take a bunch of people under the influence of a Top Secret Chemical Adrenaline Amplifier. a very useless dialogue, not to mention the high and steady doubling of the Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement. The double voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and it was quite comic. the battle scenes in the movie were horrible. At the time Seagal ran away, you could not even see what was happening. There would have been photographs taken by him throwing his arms to the camera and then the person who was flying through a wall or something. It was a reminiscence of the old Kung Fu series on the TV. too much slow motion for battle scenes. I think this is the worst movie from Seagals so far and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or I'd be very upset when I'm a big fan of Seagal Aikido. The action star fades quickly and seems to get worse with every performance.
