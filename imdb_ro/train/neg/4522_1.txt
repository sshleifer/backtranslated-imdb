The most misogynist film of all time? Not to mention '68 should not have gone beyond the white men in front of the brunette playing with the 'Indians'? My favorite parts should be when the girls chicote and blush as motorcyclists pull them into rape. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then, there are the clear tricks of "The Hustler" (the character of the fat man actually plays a pool while he plans to destroy the Indians with the type of lead rebels), the horrible act, so-on-the-nas- "Well you said" what you would think, the lack of someone who is indian in this movie. And who should we be rooted about? I have to say he says Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Even though her films have a tendency to fight against strong women, I have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynist idiot. Why did I follow him, you ask? Do not ask.
