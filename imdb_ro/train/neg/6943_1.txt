This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants to take revenge for a murder, but when he takes revenge, there is a video camera pointing directly at him. What man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do so for so long in front of a video camera? Just the fact that this scenario could never happen, unless someone can not dress I destroyed for me - but it was great! I think scenario writers have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and miss them. You can run a battalion of armored tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: a man seeks revenge for the death of his dear ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes wrong and then unexpectedly reveals himself. <br /> <br /> Only those people writing this story have not been so stupid as to write unrealistic plotting that could not happen this way. For the writers I say - look for help for your serious mental problem.
