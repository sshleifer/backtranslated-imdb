Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov, a very unlikely young man in a very unlucky film. The film shows the promise that Ustinov is released from prison for embezzlement. He convinces Robert Morley to go to take his identity and start feeding on computers in a charming company led by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duet for movies. Morley sounds just like he did in 1938 "Marie Antoinette". Maybe he was supposed to go back to this guy. This movie is best at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith has completely changed his ways and gave an astonishing Oscar-like performance to "The First Miss Jean Brodie." Smith is made here like a seemingly red head, but by the end of the movie, she's the brain of her t-shirt. Too bad that the writing did not go with her.
