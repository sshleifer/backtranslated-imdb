I was very disappointed with this movie. Over time, it was weak, bordering on a fool: Souls that can affect reality as they do it? An apparently critical mission for souls hunters entrusted to a smaller member of theirs? And the whole story of B with "holobrothelul" and the trial against the post were so terrifying that one moment I realized on TV: "Why are you wasting time with this?" <br /> <br /> Tematic, "River of Souls" did not really come into a soul problem, no more deep than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not have a sense of their culture. (Is there a soul hunter?) The actor was fine, given the material he had to work on, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first act - were very impressive. But, on the whole, I'd say I miss him.
