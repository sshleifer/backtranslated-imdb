Not that I jokingly jammed at the realistic bloodshed, but when I put a DVD in the expectation of a bloodbath, and what I receive is a bloody scene (the eyebrow) at the end of the fake thigh and assembles and spinning an office chair , I end up thinking "well, there are 43 minutes of my life gone forever." I would not consider this movie or "Flower of blood and blood" as so much as an exercise of will; to see if you can stay through them. The flower of the flesh and blood had a few harsh points to be traced. The Devil's experiment did not. It was at best, stupid and worst - very ... stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I put the DVD on "oh, man, that's gonna be sick." After watching the fake kicking a thousandfold, I watched it quickly in front. Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People who are looking for F'd movies just to see how F'd up is really, or 2) horror completest. I've been looking for this and other Guinee Pig movies for the latter reason, but even if I fell into the category of the first, this movie would not float my boat. In fact, I imagined that this movie is making the blood lust ... as if you "already kill B"! "So, in conclusion, the only reason to own this movie is for collecting purposes." If you want the massacre that traditional horror does not offer, you get Traces of Death. "Sure, that's sucks, but at least you'll get the blood and the courage you expect The only reason I can see that someone praises this stupidity is because I feel they should do it No artistic merit I can understand, no reason for his notoriety, nothing. Just an agonizing attempt to be shocking.
