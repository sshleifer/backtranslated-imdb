This is one of the most serious action movies I've ever seen. This is mainly due to a large part of the factual implausibility (as an obvious agent who presents a bank loan officer, obviously talking to someone through a thread or scene where scientists think it safe to enter in a room where the virus was launched even though "did not find a viable host" does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks poorly built as a dungeon) and the bad action. It's the story of an organized crime group that successfully stole a lethal virus capsule. However, the president who wants to remove him from a bank security deposit also makes a banking crisis in which these FBI agents have been informed of this and at the same time erupted a terrible earthquake . Needless to say, the consequences of the earthquake are dirty in many ways than one. However, the results do not make for an appealing action film, but instead one that has been obviously a quality noise since the beginning of the movie. (Perhaps this is the reason why some screen shots on the packaging show that they are created with graphics on the computer, rather than being real screen shots from different movie sequences). What the fuck did Ron Perlman do in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was so embarrassed to be in him, as he should have been.
