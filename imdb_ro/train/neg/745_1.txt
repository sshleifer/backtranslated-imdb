I do not really know how to begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most fun. I like the bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and inept. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst thing I've seen since Nintendo 64. Some scenes you watch include Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wagon ... Wow, there are so many bad effects ! On the plus side, though, some strange scenes are well done. The actor was just as bad as he could have been, based directly on H. G. Wells' book. Because they have such good source material, it's as if the actors are trying to be so capable of making it funny. And then is the mustache ... the most fun piece of facial hair I've seen for a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains action. The rest is the characters walking around scopless and reduced blow effects. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to cheat directors. Using different color filters between the photos, for no particular reason, the use of low backgrounds for scenes even inside the scene, poor green projection, it's amazing for me how this man ever got the approval to direct a movie. I would not imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into a bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. My advice to anyone who plans to watch this movie is to do what I did: to have some friends who enjoy bad movies, to drink, to play poker while watching it, to drink and maybe you'll go all the way. It makes for a great movie bad, so have fun and laugh badly with this disaster.
