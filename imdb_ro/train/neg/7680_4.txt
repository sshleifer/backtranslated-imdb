Snow White is, in my opinion, an evil film from an artistic point of view. The plot is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, editing too exaggerated. However, the film does not seem to have a lot of artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct commercial thing. The inclusion of a character from the French side of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band he is touring in the film - the band called SENS UNIK) seems to be targeting a wider audience. An honest German-Swiss film would not have been sold on the French side - and vice versa. What came to my nerves was the product placement along the film. Sometine scenes reminiscent of advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the theme of 'young people taking drugs without other targets in their lives' is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated more carefully. I hope that Samir has enough money with Snow White for his next film to show his true artistic abilities.
