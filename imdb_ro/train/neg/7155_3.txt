I'm sorry, but I did not like this doc. I'm thinking of a million ways in which it could have been better. The people who obviously did not have much imagination. Interviews are not very interesting, and no real understanding is offered. Images are not assembled in a very informative way. It's too bad because it's a movie that really deserves special features. One thing I will say is that Isabella Rosselini becomes more beautiful as she is older. All considered, this becomes just a "4."
