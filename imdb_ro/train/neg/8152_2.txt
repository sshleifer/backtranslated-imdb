"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly stupid movie. It's based on Woody Allen's 1966 Broadway play. It's about Jackie Gleason, the comic genre behind "The Honeymooners." Director Howard Morris appeared in several comedies Mel Brooks (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and made a sign in the animation (the characters he expressed included Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey ) What happened? I think the problem is that the premise is played too seriously to function effectively. Allen's original piece was "tongue in the cheek", which is why he worked on Broadway and Allen's remake of 1994. The scenario of R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise of death and make too many changes from the original piece. Making Gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a capricious woman in the original is just an example of why this does not work. The act is not much better. Gleason does everything he can with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor, as demonstrated in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in Rain". His abrasive personality could have worked here, but the stupid script does not give him a chance. Sin. Estelle Parsons "your airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes See how soon it will take for you to want to strangle her It's also a shame because she is also a beautiful actress who has transformed in two exceptional performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel." Allen hated this film so much that he remodeled the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the charts, they are able to hit all the right notes, and the movie itself is a comic masterpiece, it is finally filmed after a long battle over the rights. they exceed their welcome time. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 stars
