For a comedian writer, Woody Allen really leaves the payer on the downside with this poor character development. There are some moments of entertainment, but no more than one would have listened to the tennis shooter drier. Ferrell will waste his time in this movie, which fails to present his usually amusing delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, it did not happen to move into the other body of the movie. The film is so hard and boring that it can not be worn, but if it was worn, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that continue in one scene and do not really do anything other than to show that their writer can write a few rows of quick dialogue on the occasion, then you love the movie.
