If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I certainly do not want to see it! Anyone complaining that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to visualize this, learn to appreciate more of the backup style he has chosen in excellent films such as "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant ". This film squeezes with so many art, quasi-symbolic images, it looks like a parody of an "art movie". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene in which Elvira's girlfriend's surf channel sails for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the clearest examples of this film that makes this film a real test of the spectator's resistance. But what really bothers me is a few scenes that belong to Elvira and her ex-spouses and / or daughter. These are the only moments that display any real human excitement and prove that there was an excellent movie in the center of this terrible movie that is struggling to release itself. What a waste.
