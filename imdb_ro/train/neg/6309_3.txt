This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and scriptwriter of this movie failed and created a boring and boring film that made me feel like I returned to the 8th grade of Hartford's social class - back to 67. What waste, somebody please take this story and make it a true movie - the story is worth it. Every time a scene has potential, all we have left is a few clich√©s combined with blacks and albums that they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Strange. Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boring fest. The other actor was incredibly boring - it fits the movie and who played the Captain set a new low standard for delivering the lines. However, if you are willing to accept all the many flaws in this movie and are not concerned about being awed or entertained, but want to find out about the USS Mason, it's worth a watch.
