This was a very funny movie. Every one in the movie tried to be serious, which made this movie so funny. I mean, I'm bringing a shark head on a human body. Maybe it's funny. Good Sci-Fi work keeps comedy movies. I never thought movies could be retarded. If they keep it, they will have to rename science or the comedy news channel or something like that. I can not wait for the next Sci-Fi movie blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I will be ready with a bowl of corn popcorn and a beer case or a bottle of alcoholic beverages and I would be ready to laugh again!
