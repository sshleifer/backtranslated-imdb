this film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did not seriously try to act in any way, in shape or shape. He suffocated completely. Nothing about the movie was credible. The first problems were at the entrance where the man gives everything to the rescue army Santa Claus, but he does not show why. Then grandfather squeezes his head in the oven - really nice and has nothing to do with the movie - it's not exactly the same as the movie. There was no explanation for Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the house he chose; there were no credible reactions by the family he chose; and people are influenced here and there without any reason to be influenced (Example: The characters of Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck are jumping on a steep slope - this is the incident that makes her fall in love with him suddenly.) Riiiight ... ) there was a funny moment or two - but it was a rarity in the movie. It took another rewrite (or 4). I hope you like it!
