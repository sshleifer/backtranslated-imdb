I'm from Dallas / Fort Worth and lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was much farther to the point of making it look like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of a single scene! Texas has no mountains. I think it happens when a movie that should be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The emphasis is also very bad. He should have made Texas actors play the pieces. There are many aspiring actors in Texas in Hollywood. The film is really sad because it's a true story. I want the killer to be found and convicted. The only good thing is that since her death, we now have the Amber Alert to help find the missing children quickly after being kidnapped.
