Here we have a movie that fails in all the ways in which it is possible for a movie to fail. Terrible scenario, bad action, amateur directing, ridiculous special effects ... is just a terrible movie. Not to mention that, when you get to the end, you realize that it makes no sense. After spending the whole movie, wondering what's going on in the world when things are finally explained, realize that the story was built on a foundation that is absurdly impossible. In one of those hidden sequences, "the villain explains the whole movie," we are told that our villain did something that simply can not be done and that has absolutely no meaning. And then we see that there is some kind of monster jello. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to claim that this movie never happened. If, for some reason, you are tempted to stay and watch this movie, I suggest you take the time to beat your head on the wall for 104 minutes. This would be a much more enjoyable experience than staying with this garbage.
