... except Jon Heder. This guy booked the whole movie. The land sounded fun. A 29-year-old child, Heder, still lives with the widow's mother (Keaton), who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). I really enjoyed the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but whoever would have made Hader would be better off selling hot dogs at the beach. Heders' performance is annoying, which would be a good thing because he plays an annoying guy, the problem is that it is an evil actor to lose this act of making this guy full of love in the finals. Finally, you still want to personalize the guy in front and you're upset about the end. In the future, every movie of this type will be a free one for me!
