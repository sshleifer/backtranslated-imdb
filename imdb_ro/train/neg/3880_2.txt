I can sometimes see a good movie. I've seen some pretty sick things. However, this is one of the few movies I found grotesque in a way that was simply repellent and outrageous. I like gore movies when they're fun. I like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this movie are not creative. It's bad. It is repulsive. It's completely unpleasant. For this reason, this movie is certainly not fun. The film is a horror film, but it is not afraid. So, quite the only reason anyone could watch this movie is for gore, but this is the most untouched and ugly aspect of the entire movie, and that says a lot. The actress is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is very annoying and too noisy. Everything took me out of the movie. Pretty much, the whole movie is a big and depressing attempt. He is the guy who has a strange accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to find his skin dissolves and melts. I think he then goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the melting process. There are strange subpunas involving an elderly couple pursued by a dog, a dirty head that floats on a current and an end involving a man who has been electrocuted. There have been times when I've tried a lot to enjoy myself, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was really fun was the scene from a nurse running a slow-moving hospital corridor. If you like ugly, ugly, and ugly horror films, it's for you.
