I almost broke into tears watching this movie. Not from laughter, but from the memories of a great movie Rodney Dangerfield. Candyshack was his first and stole the movie, Easy Money had the best, and Back To School is by far a classic masterpiece of the 80's. Then they were Ladybugs and then began to look. Poor Rodney aged (Meet Wally Sparks was a small step up from the Ladybugs, but not saying too much). <br /> <br /> In 5 husbands, Rodney plays Monte (a name he must love since his name was in Easy Money), a rich (who is not always) who loves women and marries like nothing. Now he is inheriting a large piece of land and, since the land was driven by Amish, he inherits five wives. Sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is ALL. The script is so poor that Rodney seems to say that only one lining on the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do. The film shows he was shot on video with some really poor stunt stunts, which obviously are not Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who seems to have wanted to say the word F (he should have since the movie is rated R but plays as if it were PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minutes cameo. Do not get me wrong, sometimes I laughed at Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is getting too old and too slow. We can see his jokes coming out of miles. And the movie turns into a kind of PC, which Rodney's 70s and 70s do not work anymore.
