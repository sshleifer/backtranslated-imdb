... first of all because Ju-on 2 boasts a scandalous material from FORTY minutes that was literally taken directly from the first Ju-on - and when you think the sequel lasted only 76 minutes worth of film. Ho-Hum. I found this profoundly irritating - as if spectators simply do not remember the same thing! - not to mention boring, you have to watch it again. OK, this complaint aside, the bottom line for Ju-on 2 was that it should explain a lot of unanswered questions from the first film, which, honestly, over 36 minutes, just does not go far enough for make any sense of the extremely complicated story of the original. There are, however, some really beautiful horror sequences that show how good the movie could have been if it had time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered. So, in conclusion - if you loved the first original film and want to see some further developments about the story, go for it - but do not forget to hold the remote control with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes.
