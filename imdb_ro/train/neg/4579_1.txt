"What the hell do we know?" was one of the worst times in the movies. There was less a movie and more a special school, but nothing special. The attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will say. Marlee Matlin in her underwear should not be. I will not deal with it. What I will reveal is a criticism that many can not formulate. This film, while boring, has also suffered an extraordinary mistake in reasoning. It was somewhat contradictory because it took such manipulation, it became a creator of your life, a manifestation of abundance, a piece of unprecedented propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as much of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our surroundings with our minds. It is completely neglected that there are other minded people who can control us, which seems to be more. Or at least the structures in which we very much control. Thus, the film was inadequate solipsist. Solipsism and interconnection interfere only if you are the Almighty God. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) Of all the clean things that this movie will show you can do. If not, you will be very disappointed, a moron or maybe both. Also, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to see the movie, because I feel late by mentioning it by name. Shame to everyone involved.
