I was much better off at the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was expecting it to end. Characters speak a lot about religion, computers, programming, pay, etc. There are gangsters, types of mafios, who perform hits. However, Caprica does not have the original series action to compensate for slower tracks. Let me give you some useful tips when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of explosion excess, then you know the movie will be a dud. Caprica has a lot. The director / writer usually tries to compensate for his weak abilities by throwing in some bare bodies. It never works, and all she does is the (very) demeanor of the young actresses involved and I'm sorry for them. Directors / writers doing so should be banned from the deal. If you want to get bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent Caprica. There is porn (free) on the Net if you really want to see empty bodies. Otherwise, move, nothing to see here.
