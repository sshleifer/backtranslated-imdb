This is Japan's first Guinean Pig film and this is the worst, in my opinion. A bunch of guys torture a girl for a few days before killing her. And at this moment, I will say that these movies are NOT real! These are fictional horror films that try to be as realistic as possible. The scenes are bad, but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when I put her face on the floor, we can clearly see how they hit and cock the floor near the girl! And how stupid it looks like! The sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include the animal's intestines thrown on the face, the little girl exposed to heavy hours for hours, broken nails, worms placed on the wounds of the face of the face, pierced and mutilated eyes in horrible details, and so on. Very ill and medium of spiritual film and has absolutely nothing valuable or significant cinematic. This first entry is the worst and most amateur Guinea Pig, though it's not as bloody as the next one, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, trying to be as shocking as it may be. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment is probably the sickest thing I have seen and the closest thing you have to make you drink. This is still (of course) falsified (n / t) uff, the only difference from the true "snuff film" is that no one dies or hurts for the truth in this movie. I can not recommend this to anyone, since it is so hard and repulsive. Those who think this is a great horror film do not understand anything about cinema and its true meaning. I have seen this as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant they are. They only work in shock situations and are not a very valuable cinematic achievement. The devil's experiment is probably the worst movie I've ever seen and the Mermaid in a slot (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all I am.
