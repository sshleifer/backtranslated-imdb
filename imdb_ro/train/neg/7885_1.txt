I believe in keeping religion in government and movies. When I want a sermon, I go to the church, but I do not want one from a movie. I do not mind some supernatural themes ((after all, religion is just as supernatural as you can get!), But this movie had so many preaching that I was really angry. I remember witches that I I do not know what I mean, but I do not know what to do with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> what a stupid conclusion ends: the hero entered the meeting and cried out to all those elders, and that broke the spell. If life were so simple, I think when the movies are so stupid they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING CONTAINED THEREIN!
