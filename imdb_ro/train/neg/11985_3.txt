Have you ever wanted to eat worms? Here is a "documentary" to show you how! Yes ... The baby is eating live worms! And this is about the most interesting part of the movie. This film was pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as pretty boring. I totally agree here. The movie just does not go anywhere ... if you do not like worm food! This is a movie is almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing happens. Now, from a technical point of view: She should have given that kid a haircut. Who's trying to show anyway ... Bloody Clown. It was almost comic ... I almost expected her to turn into a weird dog or something. the baby was too weird to always look hungry! He should have kept it from junk food for a few weeks before filming. Overall, this movie almost fell asleep. And my children could only do 15 minutes before leaving the scene for something more exciting. I will admit that the landscape was very impressive. And if there was a decent story to go with her, there could have been a shot. It seemed quite safe for the children to look at: the bear scenes and the balloon were too faint to scare the majority of the children, and the short diving scene did not show anything. I gave this very generous 3.
