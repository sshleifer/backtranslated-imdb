The brilliant book, with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, especially the nature of addiction, which still resonates strongly today. As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman obviously had an unhappy addiction about circling and circling and drawing around all, making the viewer quite nauseated. Why the director did not stop this is beyond me - but maybe he was too busy trying and in some way not succeeding in attracting good performances from these actors, normally excellent but inappropriately . On the whole, a poor adaptation. The three hours would be better spent (or re-reading) the book.
