I have to confess that I have seen some monks during my time, but this is with the worst of them. Paying trouble to follow. Sex and violence thrown into disorientation and distraction from the really bad film put together. I can only imagine that the distribution will look back on the final product and wants to gather dust on a shelf, be disturbed by a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. She will sit down on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
