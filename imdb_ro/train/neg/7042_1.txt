This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a motorcycle movie, this is the bottom of the rock. The minimal plot involves a band of motorcyclists who take over a small town (how original!) And the attempts of townspeople to fight with them. Why am I not calling for outside help? Who knows? The battle scene is obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but both have a little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandable). This movie belongs to the pile of rubbish!
