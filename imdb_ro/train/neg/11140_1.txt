I thought I was going to watch a scary movie ... and I got to laugh all the time in the movie. At the stage where the man turned into a werewolf, I thought he was joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. A low budget is a good comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf film. It has good special effects, as it should be (human transformation into a werewolf). If you do not want to laugh good, I do not recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
