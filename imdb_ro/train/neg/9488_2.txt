I have seen some horror films terribly terrible during my time, and while this is not the worst of bunches, it is certainly in the lower half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as a trainee, hoping it will make him do a better job for him and his future wife. Cute? The film goes straight into the toilet when you realize something kills the patients. There seems to be a demon in the basement that harvests the souls of men. It is the duty of a doctor, a nurse and a guardian in all the hospital staff to draw this mentally patient, to do a ritual that just means cutting the tongue and then leaving his own haunted house to the demon and steal his soul through the magic of special effects with cheese. At this point, the movie gets so ridiculously bad, I asked for it to end. There was another hour. It looked like half an hour, "The Tales From The Crypt," which was stretched in an hour and a half. From Tiny Lister, who performs John Coffey's (The Green Mile) best for Tracy Scoggins, who plays the stereotype Ratchet nurse, this film fails at every possible level. I gave these two stars for two reasons. 1) His fiance is quite hot, she has relaxed the pain a little towards the end of the year and 2) The movie seems OK, much better than the current horror movie trend being made with quality wal-mart quality rooms at home . <br /> <br /> Finally, avoid this turmoil even if you have the permission of the Blockbuster movie (what I do, and still felt cheated). As a bonus drink game, you and your friends take a shot each time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head as he speaks. You will be drunk in 15 minutes in the movie.
