Like an impressive 10-year-old, I liked the "Love Catch Everything" philosophy of the 1970s "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy that referred to the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and a professor of Irish Catholic school (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the couple's intermarital marriage. Looking at the show with years of personal life experiences, I am amazed that the show was even a success for one, however, the highly rated season. Created by veteran writer Bernard Slade, who will write the successful track "Same time next year", Bridget Loves Bernie is a very light and superficial comedy that collapsed under her own weight. There was no real-life denial of chemistry between Birney and Baxter. However, in the years to come, both actors have shown themselves to be better actors in other projects (Birney in his brief role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Links"). Here, they were trying to breathe life into a show that needed a grateful comic edge that could have given complications deeper to a very controversial topic. The show broadcast Saturday nights between two CBS Powerhouses: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore." Both performances were intelligent, fun and had plenty of advantages (more than the latter ones) that kept my interest in the situation and characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only occasional giggles. This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.
