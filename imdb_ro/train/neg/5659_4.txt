A disappointing end for a season that started so well ... Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were among the best seen on television in any series where this was bad enough. Well, I'm not sure if the episode was a disappointment, but the raw guitar music accompanied by the closing sequence was ridiculous and would have been more home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost like corporate executives would not like to end the low-key note down and want to make her jazz. They failed and rather spoiled everything. Let's hope it's not a trend for the future. However, I have seen at least the return of a certain person, even if it is somewhat bizarre and tritely done.
