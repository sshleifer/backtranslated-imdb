The tenants The two writers struggle to complete their books in an apartment house, except for the empty ones. At first, they help one another and slowly the tension between them begins to build. This is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and, unfortunately, everyone speaks as if it were in that novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, purple and full of nuances of significance. It's like a major English college with a head full of claims wrote the script. It's terrible and I immediately got up immune to everything I had to say, which is a shame because the movie is populated with top-down performance. Snoop Dog on the floor is a good form, unfortunately none of them can come over the fake words and premise. I can not really recommend this movie. While it is not very bad, very preaching and pretense to the point of making you want to leave. I lost interest in less than a third of the way and I had to struggle to get to the end. If you are interested, I would try to make it on the cable, but I would not put the money to see it.
