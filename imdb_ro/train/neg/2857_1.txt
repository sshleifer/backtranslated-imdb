I've seen a lot of Sci-Fi Channel Original movies since I started looking back in 2002 (my first one was Sabretooth - which is actually one of the most fun Sci-Fi Channel features in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are medium but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are laughing, and then there are some that are really terrible. Planet Raptor is in the second. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a continuing continuation of Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island 2004, is a barely visible misery of a truly horrible, actress-like film. The effects of living dinosaurs (a combination of dolls and animatronics, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet films) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. The gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a bunch of commanders who, for some reason (I forget why) are traveling on a planet of alien dinosaurs. They're good people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in outer space. What's next, sharks in space? The rest of the plot is simple. Human distribution is taken and eaten. Until now, we have come to expect this in the many movie and romanian dinosaurs that are released, but this is the first film of killer dinosaur I've seen where I'm bored with all the dinosaur attacks. /> There are some chuckles in it. There is a scene in which a man is consumed by a Carnotaur (brought to life by the film in the original film), which later becomes a giant raptor. Also a bit of trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur shoots at his own death scene from the first film. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie to start with, a masterpiece compared to its sequel. Believe me when I say, this is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever broadcast. It's almost indescribable.
