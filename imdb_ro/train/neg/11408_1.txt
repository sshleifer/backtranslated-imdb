It was just terrible. I read this book for school, I did Ca to all the tests and see so! My professor has forced me and another 20 people to follow him and was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 of Cosmic Space and Hudson Hawk. The thing that made this movie so terrible was enough to get you killed. First, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the act was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I prayed to be excused. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than look at this. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one would want to look at it. It was terrible. HORRIBLE!
