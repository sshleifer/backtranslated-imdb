.... THE CAUSE IS CRAP! A kind of movie that makes you want to go and make a shot at the movie maker and say "WHY?" Horror of the rooms ... counts when the room tries to stay stable on one person and can not. Dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comical. They seem to have taken a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie with the smallest possible amount of money. I would bet $ 10 that they used home cameras to do that. Or that, or most cameramen, got drunk. Indeed, trailers are more fun than the movie. If you ever want to host a "Worst Party", bring it to it. Want more entertainment ... look at a wall.
