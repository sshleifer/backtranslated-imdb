And I mean ultra-light. This film has four giant stars, about three jokes and a half and nothing beyond that. There is not much to say about this stinker, except that, although it has some very good pairs of bits, most are not very funny. It does not even work like a love story. How about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most of the dialogue is too smooth to be sophisticated, much less fun. What is really alive is that the premise is not bad at all. This film could have been all the more, especially with all recent concentration on some fake ways in which films are promoted, supplemented with false quotations from critics. The film uncovers the unguarded territory of the press junk - those expenses paid to journalists who almost always write beautiful reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a lot of jokes, he's always been on this territory for about three minutes, and he's headed for pursuing the romance of the film blade. The same thing happens to Catherine Zeta-Jones, the character - the filmed, self-centered star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what he gave, but he did not give him anything. It's a homogenized junk that looks very pale compared to some of the things I've heard about stars over the years. Finally, it's hard to understand what Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal have signed on a convicted ship that sinks like a resumption of "Love Boat." In fact, like the old joke, he should have forgotten the script and filmed the business. It would probably be a better story. So let go of it and tell us, what do you got on these stars that made them appear in this?
