* Spoilers and extreme bashing stand in front * When this show first started, I found it tolerable and fun. Quite strange was a kind of cartoon that children and adults liked. He also had great ratings with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following nonsense that Butch Hartman and his team pushed him into the show. First of all, toilet humor is not that funny. You can easily take a quick laugh from a little kid with a burp, but this is quite the only audience that would laugh at such a clich√© joke. Then there are the kid's jokes. Lol can see people in their underwear and we can see people crossed. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing at such a homosexual happiness! Somebody help me! But, of course, this show would not suck so badly if it had not been stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as anyone other than kangaroo lovers, candy throwing simpletons living in a hot desert. But now ... is the graceful blow of the reason why this show really sucks the best of them ... GAMES USED !!! The show constantly draws the same jokes (most of them unhappy), considering it the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly the fault. I watched them continue to mention "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of humor in this game) and Cosmo would be scared. And who could forget that ridiculous mockery that any dimpled parent in Dimmsdale could use in that episode of e-mail? Do you know, the one in which each parent (without telling the other parents by telling them) will speak exactly the same sentence before entering their child's room? Yes, it can be a first-class humor for some people, but it's pure s *** for others. If I'm not mistaken, I think Butch Hartman has said something about the end of the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area says it's, the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. Can not I agree with that? I think it's just a bunch of horses that we get every day in our carts, just worse.
