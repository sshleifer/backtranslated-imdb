this is just a terrible comedy - it's really a bad movie. there are no funny elements. no jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people can claim that this short film might be "smarter" or "quality." maybe if the only movie a person saw could do this statement of the brethren. but I've seen thousands of better movies: leonard part six (now, that's funny)! I do not know how the brothers are even considered eligible to be listed on the internet: it's more like a home movie than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Banners aside, just jump over this movie. a root canal is more enjoyable than this ruthless material.
