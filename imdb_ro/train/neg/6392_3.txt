Herschell Gordon Lewis fans of the goremeister should look elsewhere if they take this film for the regular bloodbaths that are swallowed, because there is little precious thing about bleeding in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try to tell the bizarre story, relying on special negotiating effects on a budget that could have probably doubled if the cast had given its pockets for change one day. It's pretty strange, while it's cheap and very stupid (especially by McCabe like Mitchell), the total defeat of the plot is lifelong. Imagine what this decent-budget movie might be! On the whole, she suffers from champagne tastes on a beer budget.
