When anti-bush jokes become very easy to do, a show like this would be better to make sure it has something extra. When something extra is the versions of copies of political figures who make jokes about the future they do not have yet, it is simply nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are well-done, but Dick Cheney mumbles the most. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who has a battle on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not really so similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic characters rarely give their names, so it's a mystery about who someone might be with Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. Episodes have consistent stories, but this is not enough to prevent this from sinking.
