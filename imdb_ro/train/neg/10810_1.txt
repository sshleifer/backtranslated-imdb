There is only one thing I have to say about this movie - the scene in which Shaq is in a musical number with the character of Francis Capra about the desire to be a cute; you never see this movie. The story is horrible, the act is terrible (better, it's Shaq!) And I'm rather seeing Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before ever seeing this movie.
