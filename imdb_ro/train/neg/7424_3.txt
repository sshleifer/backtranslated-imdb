The very enjoyable film with Stella Stevens, who takes guesses from someone in disguise (it did not take long to guess who he was) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a heist of money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads the three-strip gang and finds that he has to act much faster than he had anticipated. Despite some gentle gaze at Las Vegas in the '70s, a very medium and yet credible action from the most involved and a partial potential line, Las Vegas Lady puts a big boring egg. It seems forever that the movie is hit by speed, and when it does just sputters here and there and does not really accelerate. I was somewhat disappointed with this movie. Sure, I did not expect anything great, but I was thinking at least that this could be one of those neat film exploits from the 1970s or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is a strike between Stuart Whitman and George DiCenzo one year before his great role as Bugliosa prosecutor in Helter Skelter. Arms struggle has all the suspense to watch a cascade. There is a punch and a head beaten with a rusty instrument. Beyond that, nothing in terms of action. As for the girls, do not expect too much. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre and talented talents have a sauna and a bath.) What do we see? a bit more open to her performance, so I could write something recommending the movie, unfortunately it was not and I have not much to say in favor of this movie, it's not a terrible movie in any way, it's not has nothing to do with it.
