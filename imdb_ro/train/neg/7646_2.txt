In a movie that follows a fighter actor, obviously played by an actor struggling, this does not make any favors for Chris Klein. He strives to bring something memorable to the role and moan through the superficial writing that he was able to display, which could only be described as a leading man. The story exists, but that's all, and it does not show any beginning, middle, and bottom end, and the spectator is left to shrug, feeling as if nothing had happened in the last hour and three quarters. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand above his seemingly average stars and performs a semi-decent job to bring back his character back Legde. If Fred can re-create it, when he works with a bigger caliber, it's still to be seen, but I'll take care of him in the future.
