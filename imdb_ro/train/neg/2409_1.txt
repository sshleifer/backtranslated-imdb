It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there, so I will not go into it, but the action was horrible there is this part from the beginning, when the scientist brother goes to work, actually wears the white coat at home before going to work, I thought that working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the laboratory itself looks like a school lab; this monitor is on the top of a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene just there to make the place look technical and a scientist actually has breakfast in the lab and next to it is a the jar labeled with biohazard and his boss enters on him and tells him nothing even about him ... not to mention bad bad I can not get the worst than the fact that my advice does not look and I thought nothing it could be worse than the seemingly dead house Uwi Boll's films look like Shakespeare classic compared to that!
