Only PPV did this. I do not want to waste too much time on this topic because most of the posters put it better than I could, but I wanted to say a few things. I did not know which was more fun: Redgrave watching the little moths and crossing her nurse; She almost complains that her "precious" boy (whom she and d have decided he was a drunken loser) has been turned into a roadkill; that the deafening tone Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the horrible CGI of Annie, who was watching her younger self! I never bought Danes like the young Redgrave. I did not even buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wishes to be an actress, she should make Mother give her some lessons! I had a zero idea of ​​why any girl (or buddy) would make crazy on herself over stud stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are just as cursed and undefended as she, Luc is a slow-looping crack, and I did not do anything about anyone! The evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
