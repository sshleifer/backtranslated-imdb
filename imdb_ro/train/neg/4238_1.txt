This movie is terrible. At the end you will realize that several hours have been stolen out of your life that you can not come back. The ending of "twisting" is very well done. The development of character leading to this end is not in line with their final actions at the end. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the premise that Rob Lowe's character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained in exactly ninety seconds of "No, we just cheated on you." Then the character Rob Lowe is not really upset! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me", she is as angry as she gets. If someone has done weeks to convince me that I'm going to die and then tells me: "No, I'm sorry, I'm just fooling you," I'd raise hell seriously. I'm not sorry to give the spoiler, because I can save some of you from there. Save yourself and do not look at this movie.
