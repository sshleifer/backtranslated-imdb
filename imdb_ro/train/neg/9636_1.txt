This amazing waste of production money is a film proof that the rich and famous can be as bad and wasteful as politicians. From a playful play by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project shot in a spectacular rock top of the Mediterranean island mansion rock has to to be a surefire winner when he was presented at Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that he almost defies faith. Visual video is spectacular, but it is the force of nature that allowed the establishment and the fact that a real house is used instead of a set. The strident taunts of a strident Taylor, half asleep Burton's mistakes, the lousy dialogue, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and the plotting devices, and simply absurdly irritating the viewer's costumes. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent and clear evidence that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebe. Not even fun. Only shocking and terrible and crazy losses.
