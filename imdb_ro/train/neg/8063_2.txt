We anticipated the different Sci-Fi and thriller films this summer, but he was so disappointed with this movie. While some people left the movie, I decided to stay, just to laugh with the other spectators at the act, lack of suspense, ridiculous termination and hard to follow. I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the movie. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of those stars movies that start regretting. In retrospect, I would not even rent it, not to mention paying more than $ 5 to see.
