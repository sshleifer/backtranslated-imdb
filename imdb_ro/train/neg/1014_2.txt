Timberlake's performance almost attacked the screen. It was not all bad, I think the role of the reporters was wrong for him. LL Cool J played the typical rapper role, the toughest and worst type around. I do not think she shook a smile in the whole movie, not even when she would propose it to her girlfriend. Morgan Freeman worn the whole movie pretty much. He was having some funny scenes, which are the climax of the movie. Kevin Spacey was not good or bad he was just "there". Generally, it's a Dull movie. bad story. a lot of inappropriate or wrong roles for the actors.
