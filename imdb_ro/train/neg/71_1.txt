This movie was so bad that I could not believe I was following it. Directing, editing, production and script seemed like they were made by high school students who do not know much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Big moments and emotional peaks (such as one of Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (such as one originally seen) come completely out of place and are not arranged as if they were in a more elegant way actually did the movie. Characters are unfortunately underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any connection with them. The actor, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but terrible writing cancels relatively convincing performance. The film plays like a bad EV / EE bad, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (real) story it is trying to say. I've read a lot of reviews that support the film as being important to Australians because of the topic. That's very good, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon, it does not do the movie well. No one says that the subject is not good, but only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event for Americans, but that does not mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it's good because it was still bad. A failure around all, though Heath and Orlando are great to look at.
