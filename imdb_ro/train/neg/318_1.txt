I stole this movie when I was a freshman in college. I tried to look at her three times, in the second, because friends wanted to see her. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny it has to be fun." Wrong! I can not make myself look at this pile of fools after the boxing match of dreams / insult war, in which the burning of the guy with a good zinger causes the physical pain of his opponent. You'd think a terrible comedy that's hurt is ridiculous, but after you look at it, you'll know the truth. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I saw a ton of Steven Segal movies and I even saw Crossroads twice ... but I still could not look at it.
