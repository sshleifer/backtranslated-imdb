This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. To begin with, I would like to say that the front cover of this movie is misleading, if you think you're about to see a horror film with a monster clover, you're so bad. In fact, the face of the killers does not resemble the front cover, it's just a picture they found on Google and thought it would look cool. Talking about the things they found and believing it would seem cool, there is a scene in this movie where a band searches their friend in the old forest, then suddenly the screen passes into a scene where there is a mother deer which is cultivated in a glow of sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How relevant is this to the dark forests through which they are wandering? I bought this movie from a man at a market hoping it would be fun if it were not horror, then at least it would be fun, right? WRONG! The next day I gave it to my colleague to get rid of the plague named S.I.C.K The bottom line is: Do not see this movie!
