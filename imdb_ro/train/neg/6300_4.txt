this seemed a strange combination of Withnail and me with a room with a view .. sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not. the tragedy that they changed the name for the US release, though .. Keep Apidistra Flying is much better than the title nothing Happy war. the act was fine, the script was fine .. overall it was a mediocre movie.
