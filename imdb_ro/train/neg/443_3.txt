In general, an extremely disappointing picture. Very, very slowly build up to the basic story. Maria Schrader's role in looking for his family in the secret past. (Each movie seems to last forever.) SPOILERS *** His mother Ruth is rescued by the Nazis by a German woman played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so dimensional, so stereotyped. *** SPOILERS END *** The film cuts back and forth between New York and Berlin and 40 years in Berlin. Please, when you do this, give the audience an indication of what time the story has. Is there never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and jabber about the Jews who were so terrified simply by a bureaucratic accident! Save me. Did the Jews come out of Rosenstrasse? The issue of those who issue the Jews is NEVER answered. Was Was Goebels who freed them? Lean Fischer slept with Goebels? In Venice, the movie won a prize for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Should it be the Jewish theme?
