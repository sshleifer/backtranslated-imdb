Well, I must say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The banks were extremely cruel (they did not expect the movie PG) and they were not funny! With this distribution, I've been waiting for some good action, but I have not even succeeded. I'm a great fan of Rainn Wilson and for the first time I was extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither the characters of Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman are delightful and I could even care less about what happened to any of them. I did not expect at all the same as in the past I liked a lot of other movies by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights, for example) This movie did not cost $ 10 cost me and I encourage you not to see this movie . I guarantee you'll be like me begging the movie to end.
