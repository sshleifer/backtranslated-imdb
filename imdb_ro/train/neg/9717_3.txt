A thriller quite obvious in number, in which the only possible twist turns out to be a concealment in nothing. I look mainly at the English interpretation of Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but it was a strange role. I would not have surprised if half of her contribution turned out to be left on the floor of the cut, along with several last-minute writings. The actor is the least appealing about this film. Steve Guttenburg seems to be trying to strengthen his role with the charm that everyone has said he has. There is a sensational stupid sequence in which he suggested that his sexual power could help treat PTSD. It's an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with charm and authenticity, but it is a handful of consolation. 3/10
