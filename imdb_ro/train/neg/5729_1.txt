This must be the best movie ever! The act is more frightening than the movie. A lot of blood, but no idea where it comes from, because it does not even show you the cuts. I can not believe I lost my time watching this movie. I laughed as if watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a shame for horror movies! For one, if I'm in Asia, why is there a white cop who runs trash cans for waste management ?! There are so many other languages ​​that you do not even know what's going on halfway. Editing the movie is a joke, my teenage could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and that ugly old man worked the window that would be the first clue. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! YOU DO NOT WAIT WHAT IS GOOD, SORRY IS SUCCESSFUL!
