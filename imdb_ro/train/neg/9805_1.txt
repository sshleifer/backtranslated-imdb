I never understood the popularity of the Saban Power Rangers show, which was simply an Americanized version of the most popular Japanese series of super-shots over the last three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version becomes completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. Of course, many children will say that the power rangers are the highest, but they would be incorrect. /> <br /> I am sure that if the Japanese speak, they would learn how much better super-sendai is over the American version. Power Rangers is totally awful, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better performance, try Voltron third dimension instead!
