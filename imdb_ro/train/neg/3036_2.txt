This movie was absolutely incredible! I can not understand how this movie came to production. Nothing against the movie, of course, this is precisely the fault of the writing team. Take the old average story - let's dance about being poor and poor - or STEP in this case. But it does not have any sense of a true plot - or at least one that someone is interested in. With Canadian speakers in what should be an American frame - this movie falls very flat. On a positive note, the direction was pretty good and the cinema was pretty decent. It looks like the production budget was very generous. My only request is for this team to leave writing alone and find real scripts to help them bring live words to the film. The net result - How to move is How sucks.
