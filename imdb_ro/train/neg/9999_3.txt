This is a kind of movie that I keep on watching my enemies, but it's not really bloody. I just look once at a time to make sure it's as bad as I thought it was. A kind of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747. (That is, at least, an improvement on Boeing hijacking a large part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends to the Bermuda triangle and sinks under pressure to the bottom, a kind of submarine post-facto. It has one of those towers of all stars, the stars either falling or slightly over the horizon. "We're on our own!" Says pilot Jack Lemon. Is right. Apart from George Kennedy. It's in all these movies in case of catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie in return. Oh, not the "airport" the original. And that's not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about jet airplanes, such as Phoenix Flight.
