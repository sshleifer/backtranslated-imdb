I saw the first of the dwarf movies and sometimes I had a little fun looking around. There are many famous TV / Comedians who appear in the first part and have featured, in fantastic costumes, small typical episodes of their stand-up program, and that's exactly what the second film has to fight for. Everything was already there ... nothing new to achieve. You are familiar with most of the often "boring" and stupid "jokes" and you always feel that their purpose was to put in every Comedylooser of the last decade that wants to return to the stage. There is nothing important about the story: a typical fairytale story about Rumpelstiltskin, without any significance. I was expecting that, but I can not complain. Actually, I'm complaining about the lazy story writers who had a whole story; their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies inside, but they did not get it anyway. This shit is the exception to Helge Schneider's big aspect, a total loss of time and money (if he does not like to remove 2 points from my evaluation) If you like to save your money and be joking badly in each Friday SAT1 or free RTL on Friday. I'm sure you'll recognize some "laugthers" I've seen last night in cinema.
