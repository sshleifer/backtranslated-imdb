I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "festival des nouvelles images du japone" in Paris. Although I did not expect too much, I have to say that I was disappointed just like many people in the public ... if I wanted to summarize how I felt, I would say that I compared it with the princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's foolish. But I could not help her. The stories are quite different, but the world's images are very similar. And from this point of view, "a tree of the palm" certainly can not resist comparison with the Miyazaki masterpieces. Even if it is technically good enough, boredom remains ... finally, the total lack of originality makes me advise you not to be careful to follow it. I rated it 2 out of 10 (a little rough, I think it's worth 3 or 4)
