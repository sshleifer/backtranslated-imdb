What a mess !! Why was this movie made? This film, as well as other "caliber" films, should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie. Kids may want, but anyone over 10 years can or will disapprove. To make things worse was the fact that such a talent, such as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl, were completely wasted in a film that was unreasonable of any notice.
