*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British-produced thriller released in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to withdraw to France and begin a medical practice. He is proposed by a convincing woman who wants to escape her much older husband. He knows Karloff needs money. Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon becomes her husband's personal doctor. All the while, the wife is rushing to see the town with the native, no good playboy. Karloff finally injects the old poison gainder and begins. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before killing and learns that the will has changed. When he shakes his wife's beans, she goes berserk and even bites her son's hand. Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse lost the hipo Karloff used to kill the old man. When Karloff learns that he is not receiving money, he asks his wife to poison the son. Assistance suspects Karloff and finds a lack of hypoglycemia. The analysis shows poisoning, but not on time, because Karloff kidnaps the nurse. To make a brief short story, the nurse escapes, gets the police and manages to save the son to be injected by Karloff. Karloff injects and dies. This movie has some good points. Karloff is possessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did in Devil Commands and the man who lived again. It is strange, however, to see him walking around and bent tightly. We never know why he's going around here. I guess the director thought he made him more sinister. The actress who plays the wife with two moments outweighs something terrible. It has a French accent. Even if she overcomes the evil one, she still hates her (or maybe hates her because of her acting ...). A little smaller than a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the copy of Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit tangled.
