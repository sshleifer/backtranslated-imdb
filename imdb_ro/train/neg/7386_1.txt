I tried to reboot the movie twice. I put it in three cars to see what happened. Steven Seagal's voice has changed? Did he die during filming and the studio has to copy the sound to someone who does not even look like it? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you will finally hear the real voice of the actor. Although along most of the movies, it sounds like the sound was recorded in a bathroom. I would be ashamed to give a copy of this movie to Goodwill if I had a copy. I hired her, but I will never do it again. I'll check this database before renting more of her movies, all of them (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you had when you looked at a Steven Seagal movie. I think it is not.
