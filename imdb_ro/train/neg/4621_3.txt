After I searched for this high and low level, I actually found it when I expected at least to play Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why have I ever searched for a little vanity project that Chuck Barris has done in recent years of television, I have no idea. The movie is simply horrible. Part of the script that takes a week. Of course, the highlight of the film is to see real performances that were "too hot for television" or were rejected for one reason or another. That part is still horrible, but bad in the camp, which was pleasant in its own way. Now, when I saw what I've been looking for for so long, will I follow it again in my life? Resoundingly NO! Do yourself a favor and just look MORE better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the real show. The girl acted where there just provoked lick popsicles was fun, but it must endure seeing Jay P. Morgon's flash audience probably made me sterile. In retrospect, I'm very happy that it was a massive flop, because if it were a massive hit, it could have been a movie "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show" and my friends would certainly have brought the Revelation. > My class: D
