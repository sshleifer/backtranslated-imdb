RUN ... do not leave this movie !!!!! For young children, this movie will lead you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90's raised the bar, this film has just reduced it. It's a slow rhythm and monster fights are good, but rarely seen. This movie made me dry in the box of cats. Just a very poor offer after a phenomenal series of 90. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why Gamera fans of the 90's will kill this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows a child who tries to cope with his mother's death and is afraid to lose his child Gamera in a fight after knowing that his father saw the adult gamer. You will see the adult Gamera, perhaps for a minute, at the beginning of the movie. He gets ass hit by a few Gyaos and self-destruction ??? Looks old and lethargic. Plus, it does not look like any gamer you've ever seen. His costion seemed cheap and rushed. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamer you see in the rest of the movie looks like a Pokemon. Big-eyed and cute ... you will remember Godzilla's child from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the pace of viewing a NASCAR racing during a 3-hour rainfall. I watched this film with two other Gamera fans and no one was happy with how slow this movie moved along. I saw an SUV full of fat people climbing up a mountain road that is moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie took very little time kaiju on the screen. The final wars had much more, in fact, and better fighting, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the lead role. The boyfriend of all children's background and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s and history was repeated in the year 2000. The most successful films Gamera abandoned the sensation of Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to an unsuccessful formula? This was supposed to be a new trilogy, and sales of deadly tickets killed any hope for this story to continue (thank God). Gamera lost its iconic tomb. Now he sounds like a streaked Elephant. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can produce a new Olympic event ... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very small children to harm. You have to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yes .. right there sending their children to a kaiju battlefield. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was showing the size of the Gamera apple for young children. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not exactly what kaiju fans are expecting. The director was involved in the Power Rangers and shows. Comes as a cross between ET, always: sunset on the third street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all three references. Rent at best or watch once you buy it to complete the DVD series.
