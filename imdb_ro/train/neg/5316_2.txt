Throw this dog blades a bone. Very bad ... you can look anyway. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporized by a large ship commander (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle that collapses the land on Earth. A killing killer of android is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger who requires caution in dealing with these two visitors from far away. The costumes are scandalous and the script is devoid of intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran away. The law shows the only sign of the effort. So it's very comic. Also in distribution: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
