I did not hear about this film until he starred in a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Nearly 60 years in the distribution list have shown a taste of at least seven names - in addition to top-billed Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not long ago The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably better known as Theater Set Designer Norman's daughter, Walter Brennan, who did not need an introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic assistant male from The Lost Weekend The very beautiful city of small towns is a wonderful life, Robert Preston another decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter making up the numbers. Unfortunately, most people were wasting time. I looked in vain for any "signature" scene, given that it was Robert Wise on the bullhorn. During this time, he made about half a dozen films and did not have to find a style. The story is our old friend's war of ray and Mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy oaters that he cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you do not count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about her father's plans to move her cattle. This is perfectly true, but how did Mitchum KNOW do? I have seen or heard anything to indicate how he discovered it. Regarding the balance, there is little to say about this.
