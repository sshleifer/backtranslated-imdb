OK ... watching many bad movies. I'm proud of this fact. many times there are some stones in the B-rated bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've ever watched. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot and a feeling of movement. The opening scenes seemed pretty good. Decent and imaging music. Then down the hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Ringing in the Ear called Tinnitus). Now, this will in turn threaten to reveal its secrets. They paid too much attention to the film. So what he called in his ears and accidentally left an earplug somewhere where it should not have been. There is no need to keep bringing it. So this guy has an affair with this girl, and in a motel she falls and kicks her head on the table. So instead of letting everyone know about his business, he decides to tear the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie ghost) and even heading right to where the body is, she finally finds her. Now the body is recovered and she is ready to deal with the only suspect who killed him. The bad thing is he did not have much plan. Just to pretend to be twins and met the type of body that was thrown. The idiot did not even think he'd killed her. So everything is revealed there, and even if he had a gun ... somehow he managed to shoot himself. So the last scenes of the movie are her "spirits" and her twins walking water. So you mean that in this movie the bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die. Good things about the movie: Images <br /> <br /> Evil things about the movie: long musical sound effects and low-grade plot plot acting from some not all actors
