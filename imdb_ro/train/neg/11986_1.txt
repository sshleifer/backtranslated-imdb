What I write and act horribly. No personality. What, you can not make a good single character movie? Hmm, it was made in Castaway with self-talk. So this kid goes on a trip to see his father. The kid, Jason, takes a plane, and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in the middle of the flight. So the baby crashes into a lake and survives. Then he runs around, surviving in the wilderness until he is rescued. During this time, he struggles a bear twice. The first time they fight in the lake. The second time he pulls a spear from a branch and hits the bear. Two fake blood springs that spring from the bear's chest reminded me of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". Also, the child decides to launch a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> gag.
