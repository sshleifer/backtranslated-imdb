Like a former submarine, it was one of the worst submarine movies I've ever seen. First of all, a revolt onboard any American ship, especially the Trident Nuclear Powered submarine, is unthinkable. These people are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility he carries is wonderful and he takes it very seriously from the captain to the youngest crew member. I could never see that a crew of a ship divided the alliance between the captain and the chief executive. An executive officer who acted as the character played by Denzel Washington would have been freed from his duties and the Court Martialed, then torn from the Navy. It is no surprise that Marina refused to send a technical adviser to help make this film. Finally, if a member of the submarine crew made the amount of noise produced in this ship, it would have been seriously reprimanded. Submarines learn early in the career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not kill the doors and even speak quietly and wearing soft shoes cut when they are in full swing. I was amazed at how strong the team represented as they unfolded. Hard music would never be tolerated. I know that portrayal of underwater life will not actually sell movie tickets, but this is up to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
