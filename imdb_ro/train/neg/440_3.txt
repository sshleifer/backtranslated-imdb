** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** Recap: Mia (Helin) returns home from the Stockholm capital to Rättvik in the countryside to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and lives in Rättvik, and Gunilla divorced and moved a city away. Mia is still alone and focuses on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and the conflicts occur throughout their confrontation and each has personal problems that are hard to handle. As the party continues (and alcohol consumption), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts appear ... Comments: To be the work of a new writer / director it was disappointing to watch this movie to pursue exactly the same pieces that Sweden's oldest comedies / dramas have followed for years. There really are new elements or ideas. This film is based on three core areas. 1) Embarrassing humor based only on characters that make a mad on its own. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This movement focuses on the last, staring at the first point as the movie moves on. No loss, since the humor that is there is not fun. The performances from the distribution are good, I think, though it is lost behind all the pains and soon forgotten. We hoped there would be new ideas and influences, but they did not exist. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend your time than to look at it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
