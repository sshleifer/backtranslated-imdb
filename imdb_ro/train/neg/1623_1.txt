Placing a television series on the works of a popular author is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire television taught this hard when they bought the rights to Dick Francis's credit cards in 1979, three of which were broadcast under the title "Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey who became private after an accident in which he lost his right hand only to replace him with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and he seemed to be one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's bottom whenever he was on the screen . For six weeks, this duo, less than dynamic, loaded with the countryside, prevents destruction to set up races, usually by the same means - blackmail, kidnappers or doping horses. Yorkshire TV casts money on the show, but without any results. Violent, sexist, prolonged and repeated, was quickly disconnected to the knackers yard.
