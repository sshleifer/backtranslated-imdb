This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only has nothing to do with other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> Girls are beautiful though, but spending time watching cheap soft porn would be likely to be bigger than watching this movie. This movie seems to be a very bad sex ad made for an audience that is not older than 12. <br /> <br /> I never visited an American college but I would have seriously doubted that anyone who did it would he could really laugh about any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
