Although he was not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name in the credits of Joshua's opening. Heck, I did not even know he was in "Joshua" until we started the movie. So it's self-evident, I was watching the movie based on the film, not driving. Some sort of "Baby Rosemary", "Man" or any other demo movie "Joshua" was billed. Unfortunately, it has fallen. Slow, incredibly slow and flat. However, I continued to see how it would solve all of this, hoping beyond belief that the final climax will shed light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a bit strange), but what does it mean an old lock. And what low budget movie, or at least it was designed. A person falls? do not see the fall, you see someone stretched into what seems to be blood. A person is hit by a taxi? you do not see, you see someone crying, holding a bicycle up. I'm not sure if it's called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a working father trying to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who may / may not be the antichrist and a newborn little girl who is crying very much. Does she cry as much as we see how many days it is alive? and what was it about? Are rats above or is Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua Mad? Is he just jealous of the newcomer in the family? Will Michael Myers grow up? Or is the family driving at the edge of the road? I do not think. They were before, and no so-called "action" could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, there were hardly answers to the questions, the open doors barely opened. Of course it was the idea, but for Pete's name, give me something. Anything. There are lots of wild movies that you have to explore. Joshua is more like the anti-Christ Mini-Me.
