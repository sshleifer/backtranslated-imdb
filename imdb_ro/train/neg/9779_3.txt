The "worthless, worthless" image of war, made primarily to highlight the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - is not a bad idea in itself - but that should be an embarrassment for all those who are connected with it. The laughable show, which should not have been gathered in a elementary school Christmas contest, scenes inappropriate by "action," confused by the normal documentary director, Louis Clyde Stoumen, who does not seem sure if he does comedy, a philosophical treaty on the uselessness of war or a T & A (from the early '60s, anyway) of Eve Meyer's magnificent book - and a general air of wandering and incompetence. It's worth seeing to watch Eve Meyer, but that's pretty much.
