As a writer I find films this bad by making him a full palm in the production. Talk about insult. I've written more stories than in the eighth grade. Inappropriate action, bad writing, misdirection and, when added together, the result is complete and total failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie manages to do is deceive the consumer who does not wanna waste time. Who could light something so badly written? It is not artistic, intelligent, intelligent, suspense, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NIMIC. Characters are flat and boring without development. The plot is recycled as an aluminum box. They have somehow managed to cast some well-known actors who all have to be quite desperate for work or hoping one of these low-budget, independent films will prove to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This scenario should have been used to align a bird cage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman, of course, has the power to kill men and women twice its size without a fight and in a single shot. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as it will infect you with a STD.
