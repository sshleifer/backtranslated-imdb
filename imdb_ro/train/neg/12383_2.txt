While some performances were good, Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and her two Italian friends came to mind - the story was lame and derived, the focus on the girlfriend's race was manipulated at best and the relatives were mostly represented as stereotypes, not as real people. I was convinced of countless moments that were supposed to be fun. I hardly understand why the local paper here in the SF said that this is a good movie and wondering who posted the shining review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this film and crazy, in fact, I went to a theater to see it, relying on the flawless connection with Garden State, which is a much more fun, more inventive and more exciting film than it. I have to mention especially the emotional climax in the church, which was so wood, and the numbers I almost left, and some of the public did it in fact. It was followed by a climax at the cemetery, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being cheated to spend my money so futile.
