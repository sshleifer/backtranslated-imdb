I saw this in a sneaky two days before the official opening and I must say that I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put most of these issues on the decision to play Claire Danes' main role. Depending on what you think about Danes, she was either terribly serious, or she is so far above her head that she should be the early favorite for Razzie for the worst actress in 2007. I think we should have been sympathetic with her. Instead, it is completely inappropriate. The other "big" actresses make a job OK, but it certainly does not shine the screen. Of all the "great" actresses in this movie, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and he only comes to an end. <br /> <br /> A horrible scenario. It breaks apart as it binds the lines rather than being truly "in character."
