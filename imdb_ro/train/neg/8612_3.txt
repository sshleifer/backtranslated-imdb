This was a movie that could be watched but the plot was a bit weak and most of the jokes were from some of Rodney's films. That said he deserved the time to look. I gave a 5 out of 10. So, in fact, one of the movies you do not get out of the way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
