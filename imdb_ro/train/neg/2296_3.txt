"Back of Beyond" takes place in a bus stop in the middle of the Australian desert led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly wakes up in a place of trouble when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get what at first seems confused, as a retrospective in which he and his sister (though the relationship between them is better understood later in the film) is accelerating by desert on his motorcycle. Then he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes moody character in the presence of arrivals. We know that one thing is certain and that this is McGregor's spiritual meaning, his prediction of danger, and so - his clairvoyance is little relevant to the story, most of which refers to three diamond thieves who break the car and who relies on Tom to help them get out of their way without making their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, all three allies are already mistrusted against each other. But not in a way that will result in nothing in mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to rise to something significant, but it really does not succeed. Even the end, which acts as a campfire story (and which really reveals a lot of narrative defects), is almost as ridiculous. It might be worth trying if you do not think about the slow pace, but you are at least capable of something slightly different from the usual one.
