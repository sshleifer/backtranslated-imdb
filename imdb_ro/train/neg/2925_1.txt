After reading some good reviews and hearing nice things about it, I decided to rent Come Undone. I have to say that I was quite disappointed. The story was hard to watch because the movie is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past, which are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors' best efforts, are flat and uninteresting. Sex is and nudity is more explicit than it should be. I've never seen a movie that seemed so useless to plot. The end is very anti-climatic and leaves many questions unanswered to a story that has not been explained well from the beginning. In my opinion, a waste of time.
