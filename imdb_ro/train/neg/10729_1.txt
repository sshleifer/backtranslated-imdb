Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the most (most!) Watching the movie ... Movies are my passion and I am a great director at my local worship-movie-rental place. I also feel the need to add that I often ask for advice about movies whenever I get there and never seem to be able to leave without having had an elaborate discussion or an exchange of ideas about what is happening in the area of ​​worship-film ... I like to rent strange things and that's why this movie was recommended by one of the boys to cult-film-video-place.He told me that he thought I should see this, and since the cover said something about being a Jodorowsky movie (one of my favorites), I rented it. The vote I gave here is not fair, because I did not think it was terrible, I just did not know how to miss it differently. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... This is the first and only film that made me sick in my stomach: I actually felt physically ill! Am I the only one whose stomach has literally turned? Still I did not want to stop it, or maybe I could not because I was fascinated in a bad way ... I do not want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, a 1 as I said. Just not my tea tea (or wodka for that matter) ...
