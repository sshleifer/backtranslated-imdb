A lot of stupid pits in the movie. First we see him watching kung-fu, and he dies in the middle of his practice. I do not mind. And then, at the end of the movie, we see them using the kung-fu that she taught only by watching her master when she was still a child. Is it possible? I do not believe this. This show is simply for Jay Chou fans, and the film has no depth in character development, cinematic styles, and plotting. <br /> <br /> Anyone who noticed that the captain of the basketball team (forgot his name) and idolatrous player Li Xiao looked so similar to each other as you thought you were the same person? Long hair, sun-boy look, tall and strong. The two showed that they came out of a mass production factory meant to bring out products that make adolescent girls shout wildly in orgasm. Not that these two actors had something of value to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. The jokes were lame and not funny at all. The scene about Jay Chou's four masters who returned to help him in the basketball field degenerated into a useless plot when they began to beat their opponents by style Royal Rumble. Worse of all, when the four masters won the fight, the crowd began to applaud and the game continued. Was it really a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when winning the match, all due to Jay Chou's excellent skills in kung fu. How he acquired those kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow acquires his skills only by observing his master. And then his long lost father comes from wood to recognize Jay Chou as his long lost son seemed just a little too quick to make the film. In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of "flick"). Just watch if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose movie tastes are very similar to those in the top 250 IMDb list of all time, then this movie is not for you.
