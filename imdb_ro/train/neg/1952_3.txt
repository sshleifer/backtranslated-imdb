Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to revive the image of Scooby-Doo and the company. Shaggy's voice is screaming and does not sound the way he ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby show. They also changed the outfit and the classic way of walking from the original. I'm not sure what I'm still with the evil angle, but it definitely does not follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo animation. But the strange animation used for other BM performances grew on me; this could also. It's worth taking a look at - once - if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. This right is enough to bring one of the joy of the show properly. Besides, I try not to be an inflexible, frightening fan. Evolve or die, as they say. We will see what it looks like after two more episodes - until then we have formed a much stronger opinion.
