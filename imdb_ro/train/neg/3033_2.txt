I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is horrible. At that time, Jenna Jameson married Brad Armstrong and was the director of this film, and Jenna was the hottest porn star. So Brad, of course, tried to make as much money as possible from them, making this big movie with budget pornography. Now I know why I do not make big-budget porn movies. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and can not act. That's why there are porn stars, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could do, then she would have tried to go to mainstream movies instead of pornography. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager at the age of 20, she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth. She has made her move into low-budget, normal-size films and she has not been able to act. Where is she now? I gave her a 2 instead of a single rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies that he made then "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we do not want to hear you talking, as much as we want to see you have sex. Likewise, you, Jenna, would have more fans and more money in your bank account if you had done anal on the movie.
