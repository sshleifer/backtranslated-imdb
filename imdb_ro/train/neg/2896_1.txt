I could not bear to stay in the whole movie. Do families like that really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as similar to LLBean and others, and I think this is a great description of how they behaved. Moreover, the absurd writing / action incredible appears as we meet a character referring to high school as "pigface", which, of course, grew up in a 20-year-old plastic surgeon who died in a high- a wonderful, but only to do good in the world - not for the money, Carrel at the first meeting. When I give up watching ... If you can totally suspend your unbelief for two hours, then you will probably enjoy this loss of sentimental, indulgent time.
