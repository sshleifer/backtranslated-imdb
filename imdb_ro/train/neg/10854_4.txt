The cradle of fear <br /> <br /> It's not a film where we do not pay attention to complicated narrative delicate nuances. This is not a film in which the special effects should leave us steady, saying that feeling of repentance. What is, however, is a slogan of horror lo-fi goth, which leaves little imagination, created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon, as a "throwback back to the terrible 70s and 80s." <br /> <This is a very visceral 2-hour experience, in which four plot lines are connected by a lot of aqueous blood, some parts of the dismembered body, and strings connected to an intestinal line of vengeance. The provider of such terrible violence is Dani Filth, the singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, performing a role he was meant to play. <br /> <br /> As the others have said, there is nothing new about the desire to take the occultist revenge. In this particular context, a murdered murderer and killer, Kemper, the father of our angel evil devil, forces his son to direct those who are bound to condemn him to purgatory in a crazy asylum. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> This is what Chandon, who should be congratulated for writing and editing this article, to leave his sick mind free. It seems to be enjoying the idea of ​​breaking blood into the holes of those on the screen and in every corner and end that can be reached. We are also treated at the closure of the skull, demonic rape and other assorted imaginations to engage those who enjoy their closeness and personality of horror. And for some of those who follow these types of movies closely, there is a strange sequence that can think, "I've seen what I thought I did," because Pretty Woman, of course, is "not." She reminds me of some of gore-festivals created from the Italian horror 20-30 years ago and a series of other works in which disgusting images left their mark, but not the context in which they were seen. The set is particularly interesting if the idea of ​​obsession with the latter can eventually lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through Sick Room, where the user has control over the way a life can be squeezed. much recognition should also happen with a soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his talent during the day and an efficient use of drum and bass, often overlooked in film as a viabi The use of the City of London as a backdrop of true people, unlike film stands, also adds support to the film's commanding sense. OK, classic can not be, but blood, intestines, intestines, occultes and demons in a slightly unpredictable way.
