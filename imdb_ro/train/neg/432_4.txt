This movie had the potential to be much more than it was. But not only does he fail to deliver, he also brings preaching to self-nausea at the same time. John Cusack is even more flatter than he was in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he should have a southern accent, which he visibly loses several times each scene. Al Pacino makes his shtick, but it seems to be walking through this movie and collecting a salary. It's good, as usual, but hard to understand. Supporting throwing in the romantic feminine interest, which added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a complicated story "who cares" where Cusack is the mayor's boy who has to look for "what he has to do." People do not work around here. Cusack's character loses all the credibility at the end of which, without disclosing it, is prediction and nausea. The final scene makes the penultimate depth look deep. It's also completely inaccurate, but I will not go into law. This is a bad one by the movie numbers. It looks exciting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a movie of sermon, proselytism and self-righteousness in the last hour. Better with mindless shit than this junk of junk.
