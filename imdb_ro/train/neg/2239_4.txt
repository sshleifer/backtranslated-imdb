This plot has already been described by other commentators, so I will simply add that the reason I want to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her glory without a doubt. Miss Drake must be one of the sexiest and most beautiful examples of "posh totty" of having been engaged in celluloid. From her and her age, just as refined as Jane Asher approaches. What was it about actresses with music brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those I love, they admire Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and nothing of her is left to the imagination here. On the whole, the film is very poor and it's very cheap. The song that covers the opening credits seems to continue forever and is terrible.
