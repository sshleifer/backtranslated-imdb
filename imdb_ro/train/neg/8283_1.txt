This is an embarrassment for everyone and everything he used to make this joke. I personally do not care about Jessica Simpson and her talent or so many people find fascinating about her. Like a movie, this is one thing that would not even get a passing note in film school. The script is a mess, the act is atrocious, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-writer of the "Rocket of Glass") has done that makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did the "Old School" to shout aloud! This is not even in the same condition with my Old School DVD! Please, for whatever reason! I see there is a comment that this is so bad that it's good, but honestly it's too good. When we stop seeing singers who obviously can not act, continue to try, I hope it will end soon. The worst part is that there are actually decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this deposit. As for the plot, it is almost nonexistent and so badly made and written (yes, I know it's another rehash) I doubt very much that someone will remember nothing about it. Please do everything you do not waste your time, but if you do, you're sorry for the actors involved, losing time to make this bomb. Jessica Simpson is beautiful, but you're still singing, though I'm not really that fan. And who did this movie, I would not put this in your resume. 1/10 because you can not zero.
