I have seen so well both Little Richard in interviews and in the shows and quite poor by Leon, who sang in these musical biopsies of the 1950s and 1960s to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role . Leon was as right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but he did not manage to surprise Little Richard's essence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Nunez who played Little Richard in "Why do mad people fall in love?" was a much more appropriate choice after retiring the powerful but effeminate character of the musician. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing then the movie will be just as good. And that's what happened here. Glossed over or wholly missed are LR's incursions into homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did so well in the ups and downs of the group, of the wounds and of all, this widely missed film. What happens to director Robert Townsend, who started so well with Hollywood Shuffle? He's a talented, funny guy, but he has not delivered anything close to this first effort.
