One is a Darin Convertible. A beautiful convertible yellow Packard. The scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent on costumes and decorations. The old rooms, an exterior of Ciro, street signs, and all that was necessary to make a visually pleasing image were there. Very written and directed. My DVD says it runs about 104 minutes. It was more than 85 minutes. It ended without a conclusion. It was a clash, but not a conclusion. The movie was destroyed by credits. 99 cents for that. I paid 99 cents for that. We could have bought him three cat food boxes and looked at my cat's face as he felt more enthusiastic. For a few seconds in Ciro's scene, after Darren McGavin got a phone call, maybe he might. .. this movie would have a surprising twist that would make an exciting movie. Then he just stayed there. The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have played a much more important role in everything that's going on here. This piece could have done a good movie. I think if they cut Brian and used Steven Bauer for him and you changed his screenplay and you saved Packard and you lost him on the band and added a sound from Johnny Otis. band, then they got something.
