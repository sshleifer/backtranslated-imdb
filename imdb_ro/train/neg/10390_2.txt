I just rent and watched this movie just to see what's all about agitation. So here's my reaction. It's easy to see that this is a low-budget movie with poor actors. The main scenario of this film is about a woman who takes revenge on her violators. This concept, if done well, could easily become a truly challenging movie. However, the film does not shock me at all. I'm just bored. This movie could easily be reduced to less than 45 minutes. Many scenarios are mainly there to fill in time, such as those scenery scenes and some scenes that I have described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains a spoiler ***** ******* I think rape scenes are pretty bold. I do not know if I have tracked the cut or untreated version, if there is actually such a version. I also found many plot holes in the plot already badly written. Here is a list in my mind. Why the rapists do not violate Jennifer during the night when he left the house to find out what the noise is. That would be an excellent time. Why not just beat a band, instead of postponing some of the rapists the pleasure and prolongation of Jennifer's ordeal for so long. It would have been more shocking and disturbing in this way. It seemed very bad to me that the rapists left him in the woods and headed for her home. Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles. These rapists should know at least that if you want to do a dirty job right, they should not send an imbecile coward to do the job. /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally came out? Which should be the first thing that appears in the minds of most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did they not smell those distress killers away when they saw Jennifer alive? It seems very amazing to me that a thin lady like Camille can pull a man up the tree and hang it. ************************ The end of the spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But, hey, this movie is not without merit, Camille Keaton is wonderful and I heard one of the funniest lines I have heard recently when Matthew is protesting to return home and kills Jennifer, "Why me? Why me at least we did not succeed!
