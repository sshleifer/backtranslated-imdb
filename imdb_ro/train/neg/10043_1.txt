I would have liked to write the story, but there was nothing. I would have liked to quote a few of the hard-to-hit dialogues in the film, but "hinglish" is just funny for 5 minutes, after which overkill it. I would have liked to doubt him of the "keep suspicious suspense," but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk about the action at the edge of the place, but I do not like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * Suspension * <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is perfect for: 1. People who are trying to commit suicide - I promise you that they will push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists - This film is far more efficient than the barbed wire that the Silas guy wore from the Da Vinci code. 3. People who are looking for alternative ways to spread terror - I swear that the audience leaving the room seems to be in the mood to kill someone. 4. Pirates: More power for them. If a movie deserves not to have the audience spend money to watch - that's it. 5.Baracules, Most Plankton and Green Algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor slightly higher than what the film offers. Consequence: The film's director, of course, is a species of his own. (And I hope the god that he is the only one of his kind ... it is not enough) Things that could have made this movie better: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A scenarist 4. Stunt co-ordinator 5. A story (Has he already said that?) 6. A director - preferably one that is not mentally challenged (although even one that was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Cubbium Plague - Avoid Anything 8 A statutory warning - "Watching Yash Raj's films is dangerous to mental health?" Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" become - "My heart is in a void", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya" turns into " I'm a lover, I'm a vagabond. "/> <br /> In short, Tashan for me is like the opposite of a cube Rubrics - The Cube should increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower your IQ and that .. in a period of only 2.5 hours! Woot! * Silent. * But that's just me. I might be wrong. You were warned anyway.
