I love the book "Jane Eyre" and I have seen many versions of it. They all have their strengths and mistakes. However, this was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable, and she certainly looked at the usual side, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I did not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less excitement than Jane, if that was possible. How could two such insidious people fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not attract my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. Timothy Dalton's version (too beautiful for Mr. Rochester!) He is more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect role of Mr. Rochester in the A / E version of 1997 (which is NOT all the truth about the book). Trying to find something positive about this film: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
