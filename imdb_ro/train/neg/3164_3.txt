The unpleasant Eva Longoria dies on the wedding day when an angel's sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her behind a truck and kills her. She then tries to ruin her former boyfriend's relationship with his new lover, a psychic who can see her. The obviously uniginal movie is not bad in a strange way, except that Longoria's characters are full of hatred and inconvenience that she gives all the fun in the movie. It's like having ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair to Longoria, and no one else in the cast or crew, is not the problem, it is the terrible god scenario that sinks the procedures. Just really bad.
