Bored London Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Hill Fred and Emily) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money going away. Their life becomes more interesting to start with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barry). But they remain as boring as they are before. It seems that boring director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to cheer up the well-known (as quoted in Shakespeare's "The Tempest") by ordering trickery. An opening tribute to King Vidor "The Crowd" is the climax. The low point can be the dining couple on the cat prepared by the Chinese. *** Rich and Weird (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
