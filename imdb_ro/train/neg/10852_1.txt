This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, the actor is ... Well, Dani, you're just singing or screaming or what the hell you're doing. Random puppies wearing almost nothing are just to catch the sexually frustrated Gothic boys. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. Story and characters It might be very good if I say the director, actors and other little things have been improved. But the movie is bad, the only reason people enjoy this piece of nonsense is because they have Danni in it. This movie is probably the worst B rate movie in history. And, believe me, it's hard to do, especially when you compete with Def by Temptation and misleading excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, so I see this just like another garbage ... A very bad movie. If Dani did this as a comedy, then it works fine. Very well done. Over and over, but it seems to me a little, because it's a mess. Watch it when you are in a happy, happy, joyful, joyful way, so you can laugh at anything or if you are raised on several different types of drugs.
