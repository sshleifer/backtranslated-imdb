Home Alone 3 is one of my less favored films. It's the creature of culture or if you're more cynical, as it's up or down with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could be even worse than the two, since the two of them are at least intermittent laughing at their stupidity. This made me always grieve in pain and applaud when the credits began to roll. No other film made me be in pain. Now I will emphasize exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. First, the plot is ridiculous. She is spinning around a chip in a remote car (?!) Which is lost and how these terrorists want it. Fucking action. The ending action is akin to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and everything, but the pursuit of these performances is rather funny, incredibly unpleasant to look at. I did not laugh (or even as much as the smile) once, rather, I constantly chanted and hoped the terrorists would swallow the baby. The bird, rather than providing comical help, was unpleasant and annoying. The actor, as it is done by a lot of names, ranges from poor to atrocity. There is only one good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely inappropriate and unhappy with the child, while the terrorists act (and judge for their film credits, show) because they were hurried on the street ... well, that's it. > <br /> <br /> I can see some people saying, 'Man, it's for kids. Well, kids might like that, but they can do a lot better., See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, before to even think of removing them. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which sucks - see these reviews for more) are better than that! So in short, this is a This is clearly recycled for money because it almost completely breaks the first two, the only thing is, complete insults and the first two.No man, child or otherwise, should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's so bad. 0/5 stars
