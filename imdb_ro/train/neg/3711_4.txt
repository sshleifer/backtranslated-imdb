I did not see the movie when I visited the movie, instead of basing my judgments on a friend's views. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls on his face. During the movie Rock offers some funny jokes, but, unfortunately, the film is extremely comedic. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one person, and they try not to succeed. The love story of the film is direct (fortunately), but it distorts too much of the film, making the Rock serious and gentle. After all, the movie is primarily meant to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not too much in the movie. The land is also quite uninterested in the whole. Some parts were totally discontinued. If the casting support were meant to be funny, they certainly did not do a good job. The two angels in the sky tried to make some jokes that were dry and dull. Rock's first couple of subordinates was also gentle. If there is one thing they did well, however, they made Rock look funnier by comparison.
