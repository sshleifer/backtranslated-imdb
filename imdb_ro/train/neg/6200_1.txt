This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. Makes Requiem for a Dream look like a Disney movie. Although technically well done, cinematographic, cinematographic, music, director, etc., are good. However, the final scene of rape in the band is the most frightening and violent thing I have ever seen and I really do not want to see it. I'm afraid he'll haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think someone would find this film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victimized in a very similar way and I really do not need an explicit memory of the horrors they have experienced. I saw the film at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX and none of those who participated in the show or in the team. I would have liked them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their movie, which I thought was excessive, free and useless. A previous scene successfully passed the mood they were trying to do, but without rubbing your face with extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie should have a big warning label on it. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see that. You were warned.
