I never thought I'd see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous," but that's pretty close. As has often been repeated alongside the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes in the movie you know will be blocked to alter the result. This movie sends painful / waste everything from "Something about Mary" to "Pink Panther Revenge". Writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs some new stuff. The only twist is the disturbed lover / police officer pursued by domestic affairs, but even this opportunity is wasted. A lot of Needle Space Seattle shooting shots needed to hide the obvious location of Canadian filming. Some of the worst drivers in the car have little or no effort to hide the fact that the car is pulled by town on a trailer. At least, rotate the wheel or set the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert, and short haircut is a crime. $ 3 million for Jason Lee, for what? I think he's gonna beat skateboarding! So, who should watch this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors are poorly playing "The Stream Islands"; People who can not get enough of Julia Stiles. 1/10
