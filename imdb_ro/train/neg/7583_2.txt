The worst movie of David Lean. Even "we serve" was not as bad as that. Usually a movie with a good reputation like this has at least some qualities of redemption, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after seeing this, I could not understand why this piece of carp was enjoyed even in 1945! I did not like the manners, the story, the British script (which may be pretty wizard, sometimes, but totally inappropriate) and the soundtrack. The Elvira character must be attractive and appealing, but in reality he was ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust the film's reputation. Another "British classic" very overvalued.
