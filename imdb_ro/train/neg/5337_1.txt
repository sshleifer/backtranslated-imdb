There are so many negative comments about "Stay Away, Joe," here I can not stand still and let this injustice happen. Here's a side you have not heard yet. Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation, because I do not have to think about watching them. This means I do not have to worry about missing a complex plot, because there is never a proper plot to start. I can take off my shoes, take a beer, sit back, close my brain and enjoy all the general impression and the rock'n'roll melodies made from the greatest of all decades. <br /> <br /> In my books, "Stay Away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "so bad is good". Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "garbage value," this is the ultimate experience of the 1960s camp. It's so bad that it's almost surreal to look and only when you think it can not get worse, surprises you in ways the most imaginative. Finally, you're so amazed at all the levels of stupidity you do not know about laughing or crying. In short: I really like it because it's so funny that there was once a generation that actually made movies like this. I still give 1 in 10 - once he hit the bottom 100, it will become a classic instantly.
