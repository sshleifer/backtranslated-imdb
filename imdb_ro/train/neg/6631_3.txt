Ram Gopal Verma proved to be a very innovative and competent manager. He has made a remake / remodeling of God with Sarkar and has done a great deal. That's what Lolita made like Nishaabd. Sholay was the movie he repeatedly says he inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a remake disappointing and, ultimately, boring. The actor ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being dangerously threatening like the bastard Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were awful and forgotten. The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came as a music video of another kind. The worst part was pacing and dialogues - which were forgotten. Watching the movie in a theater, I woke up waiting for the pause, then for the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait and were seen deserted throughout the movie. Finally, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma.
