Confusing the melodrama taken from a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark is at the head of a nervous rural nursing home, where Lillian Gish's wife is self-designate, and Widmark himself deals with the newborn Lauren Bacall, who returns her life after her husband and child's death. Strange and muddled, settled in a non-discriminatory time and place, and with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in the plush marsh. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this scenario does not offer anything to build. For one hour, most of the dialogue refers to what you need to do about hanging curtains in the library (this thread is not used as a symbolism, but is a red herring in a non-mystery!). The image hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when working in the same profession and everyone believes their opinion is correct, but unfortunately the roundabout Minnelli reveals this stew is neither informative, nor bright, nor fun. ** from ****
