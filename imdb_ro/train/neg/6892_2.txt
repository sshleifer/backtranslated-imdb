Dear good. This was a great mess that can not help alone. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not intend to go anywhere. Until his mother meets with a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) he can marry. It would have been a good film if Heder had not played with Jeffrey so annoying, there was no chance he liked it, and it's getting worse. Eventually, he should like it, but there was no reason why he had not changed from selfish brute he was at the beginning of the movie. Keaton does not look to try even is in horrible form after 2007 Because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should they think their mother and son? The only salvific grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though he does not seem too interested. Apart from a few small smiles, this movie does not deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is almost nothing to laugh! If in the mood for a short blow by Diane Keaton watch Mad Money or Smother, which is much better than this effort.
