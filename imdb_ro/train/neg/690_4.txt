If you've ever seen a slash of eighty, there's not much reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the strengths of the Slasher cinema, and is something that this film is badly lacking. There are really many things to say about Pranks, so I'll do it quickly. The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was the only reason I saw her. The land follows a bunch of kids sitting behind a bedroom at Christmas time. As I'm in a slash, someone decides to start picking up and this leads to one of the most mysterious sweets ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie is on the Video Nasty list is bizarre, because, despite some heavy scenarios, this film fails to corrupt or destroy anyone, and later, later (for example, Friday, 13), banned. But again, there are forbidden movies that are far less distressing than this (The Witch who came from the sea, for example). However, the ending of the film is the best thing about it, because although the public really could not care less of the attacker on this point; is quite well done. Overall, it's a disturbing and frightening slasher that even slasher fans will do well.
