Banned as a "Nasty Video" in the UK, Unhinged has naturally won a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateur in all departments. The bloodstart I could take: the terrible action, the blurry edition, the terrible direction, the stupid script, and the abdominal soundtrack were much harder to take. Three girls on the way to a music festival collapsed in a revolt during a storm. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The house owner, an old lady and her daughter, greeted the girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recover. However, someone does not want the girls to leave! One by one, they become victims of an invisible striker. With a long time to go and with some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and doing some do), Unhinged is a real horror movie. Music is a total mess (it sounds like a three-year-old child has been left free on a synthesizer) and as such fills the movie perfectly. Just a few bloody scenes to the end and a little free nudity save Unhinged by getting the lowest possible score. If you are a complete horror complete (and, unfortunately, I am), you'll want to see this to check it out of the Watch Video Watch list. But it must be warned that it is indeed very bad.
