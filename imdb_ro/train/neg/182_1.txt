This is the worst continuation of the movie world. Again, it has not been done since then. The killer still kills for fun. But this time, he kills people making a movie about what happened in the first film. Which means it's the stupidest movie ever. Do not look at this. If you value a precious hour during this movie, then you do not watch it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you what made him do. Because it simply does not combine the origins of testimonies of horror, action, and murder. Do not let your children look at this. Adolescent, young child or young adult, this movie has that impact on people.
