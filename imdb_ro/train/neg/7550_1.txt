OK, so I'm an original Wicker Man fan and I do not usually like British movies remoded by Americans, so why did I make the most painful cinematic experiences ever? I'm not a fan of Nicolas Cage and I've had a moment of madness, maybe? The film was terrible! The bump from the beginning with the collapse / fire had nothing to do with the movie, and the cop knew where Edward was heading, so in the end, with the two faces visiting the continent, it would not have happened as if everything had been investigated. The history behind the wicker man has not been explored at all - and I think that being put in America did not really help the pagan theme. This film was slow and did not contain any atmosphere or suspense. I have to say that the best thing was at the end when Nicolas Cage fired! I am in such a desperate need to see the original again now, to cleanse my soul disappointed. I really can not say how disappointing this movie is, please do not see it if: A) I do not like the American re-brand of British movies B) I'm a fan of the original C) I hate Nicolas Cage
