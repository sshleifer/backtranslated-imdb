My one-line summary should explain everything, but I'm going to go to her. From the movie, this film looked like a telenovelampa, and that's all I can comment on. There have been some interesting scenes, such as "Big", that hit in the middle of the movie, but wait, what's that? The earthquake * gags * wait a minute! That's Dante's tip! Well, a part of it grunted and stepped in. I can not believe how bad this movie was, by "borrowing" scenes from other much better movies. One wonders what director thought the viewers were bad enough to think of mountains surrounding mountains in essence there is in the center of LA, the tip of Dante's. <br /> <br /> I advise them, forget about Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go for real work (again, someone at the tip of Dante coincidentally.) <br /> <br / >
