My wife and I began to watch this movie with anticipation. He seemed warm and touched. It started well; but soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. It was so bad that we stopped it The film was badly acted and honest, we could not really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or why the hell could put this woman! You lost sympathy for her after being rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. I would have hired her. And, of course, like most of the movies and the T.V series, made in Hollywood, we have to throw a gay character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more at Diane Keaton!
