This movie was made and thrown out of my hometown. I remember the noise of this and the whole hullabaloo about Molly Ringwald being in the city ... Storyline ... Essentially 20 years after a movie was "put to rest", without being finished, a group film students have decided to complete it - with bad consequences. It looks like somebody does not want the movie to be completed. The story is thin. We have to remember that this is a comedy and therefore must be taken a little in the cheek, but it did not have any real oomph. Characters are mostly translucent, and the little information you get about them simply does not care, seems irrelevant. It's strange to hear Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a child I went to school with a leading role. But that does not make the movie at all. Goodness knows why the creators thought they would get to Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (a kind of homage to 80s movies / bad horror movies), but truly an Australian actor would have done very well. As far as pouring is concerned, the act would seem constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main chicks - played "the director" and "the producer") seemed to try to act. This is never a good look. Photos also had a rough feeling about them. Over maybe ignited? It's just not as smooth as it is. Killer. Lord. Would it be less frightening? But there are other shock factors and some rough scenarios. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It's been 90 minutes, but it could have gone a little. Perhaps if the script were tight, it would have been better. Many characters have been killed - but they are not actually built to kill them. Perhaps if he killed fewer people and concentrated in a frightening atmosphere, it would have been better. Now I know it's a comedy and the elements were funny. Or so incredible that they were funny. But I'm not convinced. LM.
