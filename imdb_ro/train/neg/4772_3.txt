Before watching this movie, I could have already said it was a complete copy of the Saw (complete with the place where the boys were, and the black guy wanted someone to break his arm to get out of the cuffs). MJH's name in a movie would usually be despised (ugh, can we say GROSS ?!), but still I wanted to try. Beginning, I was little interested. The action is absolutely horrible and I woke up laughing at almost every reaction from the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I kept looking. However, the end was the biggest joke of all this! I was seriously shocked, thinking, "It was the end, it's a comedy!". I thought this bunch of nonsense was funnier than the "Scary Movie" spoofs, and that really says something!
