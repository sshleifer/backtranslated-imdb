I thought this was a very unstoppable and unrelated version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom have been very good in their roles and have given the personality of their characters; but everything feels forcefully and mechanically. The beginning could have been more involved; maybe starting with a shootout and then flashing for a recap of how they got there or something. And I felt like every scene was predictable and usually referred to as a very bad TV soap. He was really looking forward to seeing this movie and hoping for something much better. The only thing I can say in his favor is that he's beating Mick Jagger's version, but not much.
