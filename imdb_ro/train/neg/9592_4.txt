I saw the movie recently, although it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a fun movie, but let me tell you that Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. "The Princess" is not quite talking, as you would have noticed ... He reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just wanted to make his point, then knocked the enemy's nonsense. Throughout the movie, I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why she was fighting, who she loved, and how she trusted her. I waited in vain. Crappy film. The bad dialogue. You do not follow him unless you want to get bored of your mind! It's so bad that I finally wondered how I managed to shout in frustration for an hour and a half. Approximate. I'll give you 4/10.
