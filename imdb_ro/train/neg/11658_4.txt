Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the four movies, because there is not much of a plot, a bad action, pretty boring and some clean jokes. But. And this is a great one, but there is a good actor, a recurring joke and a good start. The good actor, who is Tim Curry, a good recurring joke, is the odd, weird, strange handkerchief, with his disgusting hand, who always makes cringey, but laughs worthy things. And the good start is the parody of the exorcist. Scary Movie 2 is the main character in the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay at night at a creepy night but survive at night? This movie is not very good, but if you get bored, you should watch it!
