Unfortunately, it was wrong. This movie was destroyed from beginning to end. It was hard to forget I saw Clarissa Explaining everything Nickelodeon every day. I loved it. Then the next thing I found was that she had spread to Maxim and it was wonderful! I did not hear anything about her before I looked at this movie in case of an accident. I could not believe she would let something like this be seen with her name everywhere. Everything was wrong, but it seemed that someone somewhere in the team was endeavoring to save a sunken ship. Too bad .. I hope she continues to act and I would like to see it with a real cast in a real movie.
