As the front cover says "The city of our times, for our time." I had to study this film version of Hamlet right after looking at Keneth Branagh's version and it was really a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to some aspects of the game, including sexuality; a very homosexual Oscar and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60 years) this was a very good version of Hamlet, but it can not compare to Branagh's complete version. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the movie at my local video store Australia) and actually I'm looking for a DVD Keneth Branagh to buy if there is such a thing. If anyone knows somebody, tell me.
