A cute, predictable and uninteresting story of a chemical-contaminated man (Weller) who goes all over the country just to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he kills everyone in the way only by touching his hands. In his dangerous play, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The movie has an original premise, but even if it could be much better. The end result is just a movie without moments of suspense or stones. Even good distribution is completely scattered. I gave 4 (four).
