I like Columbo and I've seen pretty much all the episodes, but this is undoubtedly ranked as the worst in the batch. A lot of boring, useless and useless, interstellar food that scatters both the time of the audience and the talent that acts on Peter Falk, a boring one. "Complot," as it happens, seems to be done while the movie goes with even the slightest suggestion of ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant startup. Some of the procedures we found extremely puzzled (or possibly annoying) was the character of Peter Falk being introduced to the wedding guests as the "Lt" Columbo. If the manufacturers insist on keeping Columbo's name a secret, why could not omit this line altogether, because it seems ridiculous? As I said, this is the goal and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid the plague.
