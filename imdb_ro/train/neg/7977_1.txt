Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically a smart film. The actors are really good and the technical part of the movie is fine. But although I was very interested in the subject and I liked to think and talk about religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to see the film at the bitter end and, in my opinion, in an unconscious way Funny. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's just and not advisable.
