I can not laugh at the people who praised this show as heart and tears. For one, it is totally unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes. How can these families afford to maintain these new mega-houses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must certainly increase after this happens. Besides, the noise would make me mad. <br /> <br /> Second, how excessive can a TV show appear? It's basically the same week with junk repeated every week. We are presented to a family suffering, renovating the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks the Kleenex boxes. Not to mention how boring the renovation is. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even that segment is being destroyed by false confessions and constant misrepresentation. "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that claims to be honest, but you fall. Jump over that. If you like real TV, "Survivor" is much superior and on the move.
