The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo was golden ahead with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went into the movie (in an Indian multiplex) with great hopes, especially after the slick promos. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL, this movie was a huge disappointment. Like others commented, the premise of the film, which has begun to begin, extends and continues without any further development or layers. After a while, you just want the movie to end up in order to get you home (if I were following this at home, it would have been much easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is, at best, average and John Abraham should not try again to make comedy. The film's comedic aspects have been weeks. I just remember giggling like the whole movie twice. Definitely no laughter that does not bend me, which consumes me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his classic moments expected, but in general because his role and character did not give him much room to grow, he did not have a big impact on this film. Dhupia, who only makes an appearance in the movie, was fun to watch while it was on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing parts of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, it is better to submit this movie.
