After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime," a group of directors decided to reunite and make a film similar to the style of the New York anthology. Unlike the original film, the stories in this movie sometimes seem to come and go too fast - until you think it comes in a story, it has ended in too many cases. And most of the time starts and stops and then begins again - with stories woven together. As a result, there is no title indicating that a story is complete and that it is less formal in its structure. Unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit or wanted (especially hit), most of the "New York, I Love You" was missed. Stories tended to be much more sexual in nature, but much less sweet - and often quite terrible. It was an amazingly boring and uninteresting film, with only a few exceptional stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made it look more. Now you understand, it was a good quality music, but its bleak tone indeed really made me feel like cutting the wrists! Among the best was the story of the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to promote, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (although this was also the first movie) and the couple's old crotchety . This is so sad because I loved the first film so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried but simply did not like it too much. By the way, and that's not really a complaint, but I was amazed at how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent, unusual film in our anti-smoking culture. Also, if you receive the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eats a hotdog .... and absolutely nothing more than for about ten minutes. The other shows an adolescent who spends the movie recording the world - including a very unhappy couple.
