This movie has such a class B inexorability at all scenes, effects, etc. to make you think they have spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching some things Wing Commander after Star Wars (quite apart from content). The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And God, I can not remember a bastard so uninteresting long ago. We are not given any reason to be so bad (an innate defect, we have come to think :) and no real conviction or fidelity to his wickedness. If you go for rent Connery 'Hunting Forrester'.
