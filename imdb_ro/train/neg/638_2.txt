Good Earth is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The actor is comic at the limit. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that does not do its true righteousness. The only salvific grace we have found with this film is its production value. The use of hundreds of extracts throughout the film creates a very credible and exciting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are sold slightly and were revolutionary at the time. Apart from production value I can say something else, which is good or fun about this movie.
