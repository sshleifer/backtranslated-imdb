A "friend", obviously without taste or class, suggested that I look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see anything else about him. It's amateur garbage, self-indulgent, dirty and self-indulgent. The "Mangalia of the Slut" of the title is a low-budget angry director who kills a bunch of prostitutes. There is a little nudity and some erections, but no element could save that thing from the nature of the hangman. Enlightenment is frightening, dialogue is puerile and, to a great extent, shouted, and the direction is unclear. I saw a doco on US explores directors during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those presented. He spoke as though something important about his work, but after seeing this, I do not see anything of any importance. There is no style, and horrible video effects (such as sunlight) are just amateur. Not even that bad is fun. Avoid.
