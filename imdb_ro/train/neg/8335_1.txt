The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn shoot a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I did not get anything! In the first half of the year there is a new character (no introduction) in each other scene. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long, annoying, stressed scene. There's always an irritating sound in the background, no matter if it's a powerful watch tact, a gentle mermaid, a train whistle, or even the horrible Quincy Jones score. There are lots of parts that are also bad. Like the bad guys that drive Beatty out of thin ice with a CAR! Or, the police came to the scene about fifteen times. I really forgot this movie!
