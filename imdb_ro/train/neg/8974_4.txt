this movie, I will not call it "film", it was nothing and it mostly worked for the folk acts of time. yes, the war was on a full swing (the game was intentional), and this movie gave our troops and audiences a living. But let's have something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> He loved to see a young Buddy Rich on drums. the music was good all year round. <br /> <br /> But a cameo after another becomes old quickly. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! So, if you are one of the "greatest generation", as you say, you will definitely enjoy this ... movie.
