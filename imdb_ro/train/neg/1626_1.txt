This movie has recently appeared on local television in South Africa and I thought I would even warn those who enjoy watching bad grade B films (which I do) that this is not even funny. The plot refers to a couple who visits a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the movie, obviously shot at the beginning of the seventies, consists of extremely large photographs of people walking in real time and terribly, slowly, from A at B. This makes the movie tiring in the extreme and expected blood, the blood and the gore never happen. I am very curious - how many people have looked from start to finish?
