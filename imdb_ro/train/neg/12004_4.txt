Within an interval of three hours and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a comical but superficial soap opera in India that finds us with six interstitial romantic love stories (at least four too many stories in estimating my). Filmed as a cross between a MTV video and a Super Bowl commercial beer, the film is a mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy shows, high numbers and songs, dream and fantasy sequences, character lies, dialogues corny type and comic performances over time - all things pretty much related to standards when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It's a tedious job that just tries to keep all the right characters as they dance, lunch and breaks through the incomprehensible story. There is a lot for the spectator to have a look at here - not least all the women who have died but will need Job's patience to make him pass through him.
