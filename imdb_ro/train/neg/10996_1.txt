Underground Comedy is probably one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known that it would be bad when the box had the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written on it ... which means film makers will focus more on the fact that I get you by mistake than to laugh. <br /> <The film is an amateur mixture of childish sketches, bad characters and worse jokes ... from the boring sketch Bat-Man to Arnold Shvollenpecker's painful sketch, they are not funny. Some sketches that are a little funny are few and far away - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a homosexual girl, for example - but even they go too long and get ruined by Vince Offer's quest for comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the underground movie underground ... Bury it!
