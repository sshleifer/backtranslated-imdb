Here is one of those educational shorts made to teach the strangers there about life's facts. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsors from Kotex. Start by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With animation and a female narrator, we show how the body works, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, and why all this leads to menstruation. It's almost amazing, becoming a comic strip here, avoiding sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although "fused" will pass once. I do not really know why I've seen this, but since it's one of those short short films that might give the impression of an innocent time, you might want to try.
