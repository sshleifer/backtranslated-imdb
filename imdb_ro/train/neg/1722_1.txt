This is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen extremely boring with a lot of boring dialogue and it has some VERY CASTLE characters and a staggering creature. The only reason I looked at this garbage is because it was on that set of disk horrors that I got. The plot is absurd and totally stupid, as is the end. No blood, as ever, except for some bloody signs on the creature and bleeding wounds. The actor is TERRIBLE! Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was ridiculous, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is a comic relief and it was not funny at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was not FUNNY! Bob Hyman is decent, but no more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and has no chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is so here and has no chemistry with Richard. Generally Avoid this piece of garbage at any cost! BOMB out of 5.
