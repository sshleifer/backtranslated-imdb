I look now at the pink (Serbia's TV station) and I have to say it's silly. Shallow, no effects of acting, too unpleasant I mean, who did this series? It was a bad attempt by studios to make more money on the success of the movie. O.K. The movie was great in 1994 when it came out. But the series? Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in character discourse. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write this, were they a relative of the students? This is not SciFi. The film was a bomb, the sucking series.
