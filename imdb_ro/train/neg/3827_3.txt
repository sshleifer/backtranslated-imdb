Stereotype, derivative, uniginal and boring Western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) offer both performances that are far from the best and justified; both have superficial roles and character traits specifically specified through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better than before," and Coburn is a legendary "owed something to the man who blocked him and has to pay his debts." In addition, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse, and Coburn is mean and harsh, but not like a cold-blooded murderer, as some of the juvenile offenders. Apparently, filmmakers have not been able to come up with any original idea about how to make this film somewhat distinguished. (* 1/2)
