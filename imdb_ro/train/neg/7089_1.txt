A sexually obsessed chef leads a double life: one like a married man "happy" with a ten year old child, the other as a sexual being. Most of the documentary film follows him for five consecutive days, and he is told in retrospect with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently investigating it. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and is the only adult adult character who does not take off his clothes. If I had it, I would have rated this film a big fat "F." As it is, he evaluates an F +, which means that it is still a failure if you do not like to get bored. It's probably more interesting to spend ninety minutes of garage cleaning. "The Journal of a Sexual Addict" falls into the category of movies that, once she saw her, she wants someone not to have.
