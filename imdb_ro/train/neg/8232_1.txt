Five eyes do not deserve any wrist, I have to admit at a time when I was very worried because no one made a noise in about 30 seconds and I thought the speakers ran away or that I went deaf with the constant cry and I and the speakers are fine now thank you for asking, quite funny it was the best of the movie. I will not waste your time telling your story, read the other comments for that. If you bought this DVD but you have not stripped it yet Do not do this, take it back and ask for it back, wasting my own do not do the same. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was crying out on TV: "I'm here in the car, looking for camera light and receiving the first camera," I left the words swearing, but you can guess where I'm going. If someone would like to buy this movie (it's very good) it's yours for a ten liter.
