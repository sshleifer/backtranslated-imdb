I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I was expecting a lot of action. Since Escape From New York has been in Germany for 16 years, I have entered the film as a backup. It was so boring. Then I realized that this was just stupidity in which a husband exposed his wife. I mean today that you are doing this over the internet and you pay for instant access. It's more than 20 years ago, but I'm still upset that I'm wasting my time with this movie. This is a porn-to-school software. Dare Bo Derek and paint it in color - cute. But then she should call Undressing Bo and paint it.
