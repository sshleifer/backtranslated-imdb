This movie is not as big as the high-budget children's television. As far as I can tell you, the negative character is a huge swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that subtitles refer to it as "insomnia". When it was first mentioned that a civilization had been blown away by insomnia, I thought, "A nihilist film of martial arts!" but no such luck. Though you must think about the experimental cinema when the evil one is strangled by the long and white eyebrows of the old man. Zu Warriors does exactly the same if subtitles are enabled or disconnected. It's not a good sign. We have discovered that the special effects are somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
