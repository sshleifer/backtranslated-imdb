honestly, I do not know what's funniest, this horrible remake or the comments on this forum. The Masterpiece analysis made me tearful, so funny. However, this movie is one of the worst movies ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels. The name "Omen" on the title made me stop and see this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in front of the other three, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but my favorite is the one who gets the fire from the juggler to the psychic fair! good times ! This movie is for the Omen series that "Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid if you are not looking for a good laugh.
