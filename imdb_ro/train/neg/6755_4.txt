Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who receives more than her when she goes to the party with a nice colleague. When her friends and her friends say they are part of a "Club of Murder," Maddy takes it seriously and moves directly to "Level 3," laughing in a woman's brain in a parking garage. But Maddy, too, the one who put on a plastic mask and killed the other members of his group lost somebody else? The film of this film (initially entitled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly designed, full of holes and spirals, under control, before an absurd twist is over. Some of the dialogues are ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the support distribution was atrocious. However, I managed to stay with this full launch of the fun-filled moon. There is plenty of skin and blood and is a perfect guy to move you together with a group of friends and to choose out. Horror fans can also enjoy Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). Score: 4 out of 10
