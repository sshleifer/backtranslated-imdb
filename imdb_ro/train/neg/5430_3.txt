Priyadarshan - whenever a person has heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy." This is the reason why this man is known or, better known, he was known. After giving amazing comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunch, his train derailed slowly with films like Chupke Chupke and some others whose name I can not remember for the time being. Now, with terrible movies, like Dhol, the first word that would hit our minds after hearing his name would be "torture." Dhol is a mixture of inappropriate jokes of toilet, somewhat dramatic, poor suspense and idiocy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were fun, though they were not charmed, and secondly, with the exception of Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the act was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with others in the movie), then Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally two idiots mentioned above. The defect in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. Grandma first sowed a ghost, plus it was not funny, but rather bad. The land was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind the girls who need money, but with a few twists. There is a "bad" man who is stupid and stupid. And finally, the good wins over evil and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a tone full of money in it is simply not full of witchcraft. The worst thing about the film is its length. After an hour or so, I get tired and want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate the entire half-hour of the film. The movie continues and continues, and the same jokes are repeated again and again, and the situations are perennial only in another place. If your mother-in-law came to your house and started screaming everything, then send it for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
