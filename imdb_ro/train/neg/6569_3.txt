Max had V-8, Trace (The Reds, The Last and Only Hero) has an air jet engine on the back of his car, allowing him to make unintentional humor faces while he rakets around the desolate desert half way. Be amazed that Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and divided back together as a new film, although filmed in a blurred manner with bad actors and stunning work. Why WoF settled in post-apocalyptic desert? Simple, the Road Warrior was! In fact, any question can be answered: it was so in Warrior Road! Except for the mutant actors outside of The Time Machine movie of the 1960s that make a cameo look to give the audience an unspoken action to chew a few minutes. 80 fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are hit or easily jostled explode in a huge explosive explosion. Inevitably, all car chases will happen near the convenient parts of the rocks, and cars will inevitably fall out of them. Together with the wild cinema voyage of the 1980s, the misogynism is generalized in this cheap movie style. Generally, I waited for Trace's rocket to accelerate and fire, so it would be another blow to straighten his face as if it had to be difficult, which happens more and more what looked at him constipated. Badly choreographed action, combined with a bad adventure, makes this movie true. Unintentional humor even manages to wear thin. Rats: Terror nights by Bruno Mattei are superior. And that means a lot! By this number 2020, Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Fire Wheels. A poor road warrior who does not have too close to the cheese factor to make the movie pursued. <br /> <br />
