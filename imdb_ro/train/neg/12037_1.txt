This series is one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Terrible action, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. Stories are so far from Robin Hood's legend, it's amazing. Apparently, they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting. Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you would enjoy the show. This is a horrible approach to a TV series. Such visual support should provoke your imagination, you should not force your imagination to do something good. It would be like the Simpsons episode in trying to brainwash with a religious propaganda film and he starts talking about who killed who or anyway. "If a movie is boring, I compose my own story." In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
