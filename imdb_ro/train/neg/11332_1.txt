As big as a Texas prairie and equally boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not float this overbooted boat. Taylor, in fact, CREATE a wrong wardrobe - wrong, a wrong hair and a wrong makeup - a unique achievement in his remarkable career. Hopper offers the only credible performance, and Dean in the climatic scene has remarkable talent as something we usually do not remember for him - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and asks a question, for example, Redford could have done with male lead. There is no discernible plot that offers any tension up to the last twenty minutes, just a label of landmarks that have a small relationship between them. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character development, but only a collection of cardboard cuts that appear periodically without a reason that can be identified as random targets in a shooting gallery. To agree, the film addresses racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects, and has SIZE, making it a great choice to excuse the unwanted home guests. Those who have the DVD version can keep some of the tape starting with the second disc. You will not miss anything of interest.
