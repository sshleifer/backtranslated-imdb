I read some reviews here on IMDb and I thought I would give this movie. Disappointed. In addition, male leaders are good and an interesting photo, but overall this film fails to convince. It seems to be full of its importance of self-indulgence in trying to say something significant, but falls as short as possible and everything in the whole picture is an unconvincing mess. It is one of those films classified as a noir movie that can be defined as follows: "A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threats, and cynical characters." This is the story here: 3 losers hinder each other with their collective problems including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. and together they conspire to kidnap a child and wander each other. It would have been a much better film if the story was more limited to kidnapping than the kidnappers' character flaws. I thought the female leadership came out of her depth and met like an amateur actress. While we had some good moments, I ended up feeling like I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
