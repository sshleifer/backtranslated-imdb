DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat stupid comedy about a bunch of spouses conspiring to hurt their husbands. It is by no means embarrassing evil as comedies that I can mention, but never bring them into potential. Imagine how well it could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers who were running Ben Stiller as Carter Elson. Oh, is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just curious because the capture phrase on Dr. Elson's show is "careful after one another and continues to speak"
