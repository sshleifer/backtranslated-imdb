4 years ago I liked this movie. I will always follow him fast. But now ... I do not know. In fact, I think this movie would have been great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. She has a lot of heavily commented actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a rather cheesy plot. My favorite part is that Culkin travels his motorcycle and he comes in a gang and a band member says "Hey, Tyler, where are you going? Also, look for the classical line" Do you have a toes? "On the other hand , is better than "Good Son".
