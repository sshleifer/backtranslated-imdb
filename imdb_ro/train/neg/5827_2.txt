You do not get the impression from other reviewers that this film is extinguished because it is ambivalent in terms of the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is not worse than US meat trade or Scottish haggis) , moves because it is pretentious tosh, the up-to-the-back guff that becomes modern art a bad name. That being said, there are some amazing images, but while traveling by bus there are stunning images if you use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat swallowed, and then, even when you think it's over, it starts again. I saw her in a Rome porn theater that was hired for the weekend to show Barney's films, which is an admirable and intelligent way to recover what had once been a local fellow from the old dirty old brigade , but if Bjork fans were to be honest, younger and a little older fans, everyone would have a lot more fun if one of the pornoes showed it!
