How could such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet be involved in such a ... well ... such a thing? I can not understand. It was terrible, he played very bald (but some of the few main roles), the jokes are stupid and absolutely not funny ... I will not talk about this movie except for a little advice: Do not go this will be a loss of time and money.
