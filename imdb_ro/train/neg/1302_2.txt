This movie is like any other film in the Netherlands, so if you enjoy movies such as Turkish fruits and kleine blonde doodle. then it might be okay with this (even if the two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but even a good scene ends up having nothing to do with the story. There is a lot of nudity (but I and others simply could not find that attractive girl), the dialogue is ridiculous (as I did a lot to annoy other film observers), and some of the scenes are so completely random that this the thing is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else (such as a random scene in which an owl rips someone's eye out ... has nothing to do with anything and is referred later than once in a a sentence saying "you heard what happened ... I was there.") The only reason I gave her a 2 is that some of her places are beautiful ... so it is. And the reason I saw it that's because we were in rapid preview (here in the Netherlands we have a weird system in terms of sneak previews, you pay less money, then for an ordinary movie and you do not know what the movie is that will be All you know is that is a f a new ilm that is not yet in the theater.) My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good Dutch movie temmink watch or zwartboek.
