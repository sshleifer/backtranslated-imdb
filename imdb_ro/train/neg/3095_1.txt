Finally, I finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this horrible God movie just to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a direct sequel to TV this year. all the films reviewed by MST3K - and really digging from the bottom of the barrel, reputedly watching the evil "Manos", "Wretcher", "Incredibly strange" and less known disasters such as "Laserblast," Zombie Nightmare, "Chasers of Time" - surely it has to be the biggest stack of garbage they've ever shown (making it perfect for riffing). Quite simply, the film refers to a bunch of Munchies-like heaps, exploiting people's wishes for fame, fortune, skill and, of course, sex in ways that kill themselves. But this is a kind of movie in which acting is so ridiculous (a machismo test, for example, illustrated by two boys who is struggling in the front yard with garden tools), writing is so forceful the scene of a bunch hanging on a girl's arm who would have noticed her if only she turned her head by a quarter to the left ... and is not for the first time in the movie this is happening) and the story is so ... rarely paid attention (hence the MST3K riff about a "law in the future, if the movies have to be made by the filmmakers) that really roots for fur dolls to kill everyone on the screen.
