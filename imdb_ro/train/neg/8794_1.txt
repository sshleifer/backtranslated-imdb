I am completely disturbed by the reason why this movie is really enjoyable, the more so respected, especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensitive. There is one key word that describes this film at its core - irritating. The easiest way to explain this is the use of the director - or, more precisely, the abuse - of music. In the first half of the year, a very tough reggae song is interpreted three times (once it's too often). But in the second half, "Mommas and the Pope" "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually at the top volume. Dance, whether you liked the song or not, you will be very sick of it all the way. Think about it, some people claim they have seen this movie four or five times. This means listening to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... All these unnecessary hyper-repetitions (do not contribute to the story) could be exempt if the rest of the movie had a lasting merit or if the story involved in some way. But it is not. The only thing I found was that Bridgette Lin loaded and still playing Invincible Asia in a waterproof and sunnies. Even this was pretty fast. I'm sure this highly deserved reputation of this film will convince many poor outsiders to go and see it. I can only warn you if you have never seen a HK movie before, do not start with it. If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid seeing it in a cinema at any price. The fast forward and mute buttons are essential survival tools here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
