LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis's weirdest movies. Harassing part, hair puff, unreal and partially strange side. Elvis meets a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice. Looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make sense, as is the case with most of Elvis Presley's films and there are a bunch of strange characters. No more music in this, but what I like, although none is memorable. A strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey enter her beach house at night, but a few minutes later comes a delivery boy and is a bright daylight! What the?? It's about the essence of the movie. What the?? Two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) the dog steals the show.
