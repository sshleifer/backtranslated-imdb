How has this ever occurred? Generally, I love F / Bigfoot sci-fi regardless of movies, etc. . but I still expect them to be written without too much cheese like this. The effects were sad, the lines were more sad. Avoid at all costs. I just finished renting her because he was in a bad case (I was looking for Sasquatch with Lance Henrikson in it - I have not seen him yet). The idea of ​​the film is actually a good one. There was plenty of potential to make a great movie here. I do not understand how this ends. Go to speak to students interested in film / arts / English in any high school and find people who can write a better script.
