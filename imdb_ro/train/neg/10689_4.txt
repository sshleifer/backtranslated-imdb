Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames the assassination of the American president, I will immediately show that this role is not the role of this very talented actor and this film shows us why. He joins a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to discover the conspiracy that surrounds the president's death and so on, blah blah blah. Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon "End Game", I can not get your attention, simple and simple; part of the action is good, the act is not all bad, and the story, though climbed and made before, could have resulted in a fun and enjoyable film - WELL IT DO NOT! Writing script and direction is absolutely sure that at any moment you do not suck in the story or make you think the least of any of the characters. 4/10 It's Boring, Predictable and Dull.
