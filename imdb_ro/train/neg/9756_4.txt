Despite the title (English), this seems to have little to do with the Devils and much more to do with a powerful hungry chief looking for Philospher's Stone and wanting gold made of lead (virgin blood). Jacinto Molina interprets Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little trouble with the fact that people are killed when they think they threaten their position or when they need virgins for their blood. In essence, he is urged by the love of his lady and by an alchemist he hired, and there is more greed and madness, which seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting such as jousting and elderly men trying to beat each other down with big sticks and the movie has at least a good look at it, but otherwise there is not much to recommend. Few in the way of the gorilla and nothing to be afraid of, and most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy film, not even an unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
