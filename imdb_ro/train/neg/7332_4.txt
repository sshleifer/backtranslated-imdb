Despite being a 2001 film, the direction is a sort of art style from the 1990s, which was considered "old" and overtaken a few years ago. Cuts and knife effects were painful to track. The scenario is pretty decent and some scenes captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings it to the bridge at night). But the story with the detective his sister committed suicide and how he was obsessed with suicide was simply terrible. The show of the actor playing Selma Blair's boyfriend seriously bothered me. Still, we did everything that's happening, which is rare for the type of random movie, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and you decide to watch it.
