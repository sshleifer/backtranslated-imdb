This film was filmed back with the 1992 remix of Conan Doyle's famous "Lost World" novel. And he shows that. The film starts pretty promising, with a ruthless organization that intends to exploit the lost world, and Challenger and others come back to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go down. Everybody is stuck on the plateau and we are left with a weak, boring and long-lasting remake of the first movie. Dinosaurs (which are almost never seen) are just ridiculous. Do we expect to take that cuddly toy that should be an ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaurus seems to be rooted in the field. Do yourself a favor and understand the 1925 silent version of the World of the World. Unbelievable in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenty version is the best and will remain so until someone finally decides to make a decent rejuvenation.
