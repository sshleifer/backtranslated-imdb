The actress had too many teeth, and when she came into contact with one of the beasts, the appearance was too clear. This movie totally carries the cover on DVD, which looks quite interesting. There's a giant monster waiting on the cover, but you're making these cute, not as gigantic as the expected electric water. He moved to watch another movie called The Killers Rats, but that's another review. Deep Shock was really stupid, a big shame, given that it looks like a fairly high budget.
