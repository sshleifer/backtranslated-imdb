"Ambush" is not an ordinary action. It's very bad to be habitual. One man is headed for another with a gunshot machine. The other man draws a single round and crashes the man with the higher fire power, without a nickname from the hail of lead to rain on it. Guess who's the good guy. Spirit. This is "Shot" through and over. It's not a good movie, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels, with a distribution of B film veterans who move mechanically through movements almost as if they know they are doing a real lame duck. It is not recommended to anyone. <br /> <br />
