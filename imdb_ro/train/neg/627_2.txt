Dear Sir. This movie ... It was horrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And, most of the times horror movies say other people are bad, I like it. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was amazing, I'll say that. But this plot was terrible. Makes no sense! She had too many gore and a futile (and revolting) sexual scene at first. I think the director is trying to be "shocking" or not, but it just went awry. To add a bunch of nonsense they call a plot, the actors (besides the "scarecrow") are terrifying and I'm so bored about them that I soon forget who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, please do.
