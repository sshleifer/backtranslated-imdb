I think this is proof that Joe Don Baker will do something for a dollar. The concept of film was not very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it I do not know where to start. The actor is horrible. Cinematography is, at best, marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There is one reason why this movie arrived at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before writing this and I can not believe 9 people thought this movie was excellent. They probably liked the two go-go dancers. The final justice would be if it blocked this stinker in the movie safe outside of Wichita and did not let anyone see it again! A rating of 1 out of 10 is much better than it deserves.
