I have seen goals of change ..twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see Olsen twins do the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with boys .. OK now about the movie .. .. first all boys and girls of this kind do not play on goals so big ... 2.football does not play in time ... 3. if the game is over the referee gives some extra hours (one minute or more much) ... and finishing is so predictable ... I think this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledge .... if it were done by the European producers would be better .. and also the actors leeches are not the choice of wright ... they suffer from the lack of authenticity .. OK have played some seasons in full, but that does not make them big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's missing in Olsen twins
