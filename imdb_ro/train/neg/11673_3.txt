First seen 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The fact that the disaster at Titanic is quite disturbing is the first featured version of this storyline event. The replication of the disaster is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes bad, bad and frightening. The story is very similar to the latest, except that it shows how the crew tried to hide the real disaster that happened almost too late. Good for nostalgia only goals and to get a sense of what James Cameron was in competition (barely?) In his recreation.
