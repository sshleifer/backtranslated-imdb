In the 1970s, when I first saw her, I was in high school. Then it was cold. Now, as an adult, I look back at him and say ... well. What was so funny? It has moments, but they are few and they are far away. It's so dated that jokes do not rise. Show this to a younger crowd and will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you may want to stay with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision, as well as the Groove tube, are too popular for today's viewing.
