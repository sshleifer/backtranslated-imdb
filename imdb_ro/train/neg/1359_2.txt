A good cast is scattered in this story slower than complicated molasses and comedy. Peter Ustinov is trying hard here to bring something to life, but the result is a boring pain that does not have all the right beats that could have been traced. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this movie is terrible. Badly recommended. Modified wrong. It did not act correctly. Very written. You need to stay on a hundred movies to come across one so bad. The horrified and embarrassed cry is that Ustinov made his way into a US insurance company to hack his computer and kill millions of pounds. How he does this is beyond the lameness and credibility (he just learns the computer skills apparently overnight by reading brochures, and computer expert hoodwinks Robert Morley to go to South America and steal his identity). a side plot, Ustinov tells colleague Maggie Smith, who just happens to become his secretary by accident after receiving an apartment in her building. She ends up sharing scenes with sexual subtleties with Bob Newhart, who do not go anywhere, while Ustinov goes to spend money a little and try to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and goes to Brazil, which has become the almost absolute end of each of the British Caperan comedy of that time (the nuns on the run "a fish called Wanda?"). is more ridiculous than everything that has appeared before. Finally, I thought I must really be on my rocker to get out of this. Even a cousin of Cesar Romero did not help her. One of the most unfortunate "comedies" I've ever seen and certainly the worst crap. Do not waste time. If you like this, you have to watch better movies.
