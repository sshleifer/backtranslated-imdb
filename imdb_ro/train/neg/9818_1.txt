This film raises a series of pressing questions in my mind. First, how has Jennifer Tilly succeeded in supporting a cinematic career for all these years, based on that ridiculous voice and a very limited range of facial expressions she uses? Secondly ... what were the people responsible for making this offensive and profoundly reluctant film? And thirdly ... considering that there were enough perverse people to decide to do so, there should not have been anyone in the system - the studio, the distributors or somewhere - healthy enough to prevent the staff from being completed and released. You really should have been looking for a very, very long way to make another movie as bad as this one ... and it's not even billed as a horror movie - which, as far as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate genre, is certainly. The film starts from the beginning to the end in a kind of madness, violence and abuse, and essentially has no redeeming features. I do not actually support censorship (which I do not think), but I do not see how anyone can get something positive from watching a movie like this.
