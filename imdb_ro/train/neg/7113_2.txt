SCULLING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This movie boasts some rather refreshing opening credits (a storyteller that warns filmmakers will receive a free funeral if they die for fear of looking at this movie, a scary blow to a skull that comes out of the pool and scary pervasive music) but, unfortunately, the movie is all the way down there. A widow man takes his new bride to his isolated manor ... advising his servants and friends that the new lady has a very fragile mood due to a tragedy in her past. Well, in the shortest time, she starts to see and hear mysterious things that no one can do. Her husband assures her that everything is just in her mind and ... maybe you'll probably see where that happens. You will realize what's going on long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you've probably seen exactly the same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and you've also done better). To add to the film's transgressions, most cuts in this movie (on many cheap DVD compilations) seem to be missing in some key scenes. You see that heroine tries to go to the window ... he's going to open it ... you know she'll see something scary ... and then ... suddenly, the scene cuts her tears into her husband's arms. So what did he see ??? I think we'll never know.
