A movie with very few positive things to say. <br /> <br /> First of all it has a zero rhythm and is devoid of any drama. Besides being remarkably slow, Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same movies again and again. We've lost the number of times we've seen the "night" field at night or that cracked earth. He also has the fundamental defect of thinking that if the public does not know about the things they will get, rather than confused. So without signs that there are problems, we suddenly find that marriage is not what it seems to be, despite the fact that it seems to be good. We find that Jacob is probably the worst farmer in the universe because he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a totally useless sour. Beth has a key on a bookstore? There are countless other questions, some of them later solved in the movie, much later, actually too late. And at the point of acre. Horror films note that the big inanimate objects are not inherently frightening? and also if they are meant to be a big sour then to do so. There is also a frightening lack of reasoning that Beth (the best performer in the play, followed by Jefferson's "policeman") suddenly seems to be accused of under the sun just because he's on "medication." Ten minutes apart, in addition, to run around the field looking for the missing child (came out of the window - has six months), the film falls into a badly written scene after a badly written scene. Bad horror horror music fails to add the atmosphere. The often evil movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
