Sondra Locke quit in this movie, but she was a terrible actress anyway. Unfortunately, she pulls everyone else (including then real-life boyfriend, Clint Eastwood, down the canal with her.) But what was Clint Eastwood thinking about when he agreed to stay in this movie? to be a real snorer. It's a very poor story, basically no story or plot. I added to the bored, poor action, even from Eastwood, normally good. There is absolutely no action, with the exception of a few arguments and, for me, this film is ranked at the top of the pile of natural sleep enhancers. Could it be a more boring film? I think seeing dry paint or growing grass can be more fun. A real stinker. Do not bother with this.
