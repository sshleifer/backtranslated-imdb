Marie Dressler bears this drama about the depression era about a good bank owner who recently broadcast TCM in Fools April's comedy month. If you come with the big laugh, in favor of Dressler-Polly Moran, you will be disappointed, because it is really a very poor film. It's also very badly done, surprising, so considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith is an empty-bones cinema that is strictly in the "arrange the room and not move it", often at the expense of distribution, which is in the lines on the screen (it's like a panel and scan before it exists! ) or with the head cut. The film does not even have a credited director to be the subject of the apparent production image. Generally, it's an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre, final bobbin coil in the bathroom to distinguish it.
