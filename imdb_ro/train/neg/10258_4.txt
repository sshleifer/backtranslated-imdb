The earth is destined to no longer be content with Father Pergado and a multitude of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said he was mistaken to appear in this regard by his producers who have told him that a lot of big actors are involved) is Father Pergado and makes his usual routine and scary routine. Distribution is not too bad, though most have retreated from acting. The movie has terrible sound effects (created mainly by pressing keys on an old computer, it seems) and sometimes thinks ridiculous - showing a scene of the sky, for example, for what it feels like for hours. Despite this, the story is quite humorous in a kind of world and is somehow condemned and production is appropriate. Interestingly, a scene includes Albert Band and Jackie's wife; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's assistant Bennah Burton. Despite her fertile nature, I really wanted to see how she did all things and, therefore, quite pleasing.
