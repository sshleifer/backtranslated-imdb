What was Steven Seagal thinking? First of all, I like Seagal. I like all the movies until the mid-2000s. Its early things are some of the best in genre. However, this does not amount to its excellent name. The force of the attacks (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in the typical bottom-kicking form. However, what we get is a murder mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who move to superhuman when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. Seagal's duplication is a shame, a shame and a shame. Why man man? The story is terrible. That received 2/10 from me because of the scene in which Seagal requires a reserve, despite having an army with him, and a hilarious battle scene in which the seagull links his hands like a girl faced with the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street" says in this movie ... forget the revenge of Steven, you need redemption!
