All I can say is that before we watched the movie, we did not have any clues about who was Annemarie Schwarzenbach or her life story ... and I have to confess that the movie was not nearly helpful to get this data. and even failed to persuade me to do some research by typing a few words on the Google site; however, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was awesome with her facial expression, she played really well and showed a deep, depressed mental state as she is. After all, based on the scenario of the film, it happened in Turkey and Tehran as well as in Afghanistan .. but believe me I am familiar with the area, it was an Arab desert in Morocco. The Turkish people and the Persian people are completely different in the face and culture as well as in the language that is not Arabic. I think that in order to make a film like this kind of documentary, a thorough research of all these minor elements is mandatory.
