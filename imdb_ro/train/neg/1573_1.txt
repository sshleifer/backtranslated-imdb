How this piece of trash was put on the film is beyond me. The only actor I know is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is just a justification for putting him into production. I do not even think it deserves a nomination for a red tomato prize, this film really makes movies B a cinematic pleasure. A car traveling along the highway with the police in tow and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, right. The script must have been written on the back of a box of cigarettes. Most made for TV movies are terrible, but this redefines the word. Check out the bridge operator's skills, pure Oscar material.
