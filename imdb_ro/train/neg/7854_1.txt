wow this is the worst movie ever. the only reason I signed for IMDb was so I could complain about this movie. I never left a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped this (and should have). but I looked at it all the way, just to let it go down again with an absolutely terrible end. wow if this is all that wes craven can produce its time is long time up. I've never seen the first and I'll never see that. his terrible act with a terrible plot. hey that someone is shaking a mirror at us let us check. and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD, it was completely checked at the blockbuster forever. so I feel bad for all the people who have seen this junk.
