When I saw the previews for this movie, I did not expect too much to start with - around a second teen movie horror movie. But, wow, this movie was absolutely terrible. And that's generous. First, casting for the movie was terrible. You do not feel sympathy (or, anyway, any morbid feeling) for the characters. The act was so terrible that we simply waited and hoped that the terrible thing would end. Second, there are points in the movie that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Can anyone please explain why the boy-like boy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the tip of your lungs as you enter Jackie Chan's movements that I have not seen before, and biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the child's father continue to override the virus infected person and go into a red hunting sling to find him? I was left with a sense of such confusion and total mistrust that I said loudly, "Where the hell came from?" I just could not believe what I saw. I really thought I'd seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever is all over. This movie made me want to eat and then melt again. Then blow my brain. <br /> <br /> Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching the grass grows, perhaps, is an appropriate alternative.
