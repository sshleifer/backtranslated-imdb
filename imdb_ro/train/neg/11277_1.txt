There is no doubt that this film has an impressive distribution, but unfortunately this does not help the great disadvantages of the film. I never understand why directors ask actors / actors to use not their accents when it's obvious to everyone they can not convince. Fiennes can not do Irish, and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how good the act is, the character will never be convincing. As for the major problem ... the plot ... was one? I think it was kind of a story, but it was so full of holes that I just could not wait to finish the movie ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
