I remember looking at ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The science channel was worse, but not much. A shameless ripple of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are free, devouring as much as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and prosthetic cat heads are ridiculous. We have some ghosts that help a little. Wait until you see how the crazy scientist who started this misery gets it. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has little to do, distribution is not known. Looks like he was shot in Fiji. Good work if you can get it. It reminds me of all those low-budget, world-class STVs that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s.
