The only reason I even gave it 1 out of 10 is that the option to give zero out of 10 was not allowed. It was the biggest waste of time I ever suffered. For about 75 minutes, you are subject to the best actor (and I do not want to say that in a good way, as in KILLER NERD, which has a great horribility) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. The reason we rented this piece of nonsense was that it had a massacre in the title. Having said that, there was only one killing in the whole movie and it was pretty lame at it. You spend more time looking at the kids who were arguing and doing work in the yard than anything else. Speaking of children, the boy actor is probably the most irritated child from the cemetery house grate. Did I mention that he was also shot on the video? If you want to throw money and over an hour of your life, then by all means watch out. But if you sip a few dollars earned and time, then wandering as far as possible.
