It is not so much that spontaneous burning has a small potential. Indeed, the under-explored title phenomenon is quite interesting, and for at least half the opening, this effort by Tobe Hooper promises to distract in some way only the horror of the 1990s. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's performance and the complicated plot, this thriller might lose its way. Dourif, presented here before his fans have accumulated, is an ordinary guy Sam. Of course, regular boys are not on average in the horror movie, so, after a well-made sketch of origin, we see that the different parts of Sam's body start to ignite. Soon he also lights other people to the dismay that Lisa has played with Cynthia Bain. While the title of the film involves a happy monster on fire, director Hooper chose to make Sam a killer. This approach gives the film a deep depth of man that it would otherwise lack, but it even prevents us from fearing the human flame. We let ourselves wonder if this would work better than a direct-up-villain effort versus everyone on NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a fairly nominal effort when everything is said and done. This will bring extra attraction to Dourif fans and those who can not get enough horror from the 1990s, whether good or bad, or between them, but only on a slow night.
