Knowing comics from Enki Bilal for some time, I had to see this movie. I thought it would be a good way for an artist like Bilal to spread his art and ideas to a wider audience. I also thought it would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I'd enjoy watching ... I was wrong! The film was a real torture to watch. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves too much to be desired, and basically anyone who sees this movie has the impression it could do better. I will not suggest if you should see this movie or not. The chances are if you read these pages that you have already seen or will see - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes.
