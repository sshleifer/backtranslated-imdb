The TEMP (1993) did not do much about theater, but here is the direct-to-video rupture that you would not want anyway! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a large-scale brokerage firm that is beginning to receive useful suggestions from Secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre turns out to be an ambitious father who will not stop at anything to move on the corporate scale, including screwing up a top broker she can not handle and killing anyone on her bad side. She escapes skeletons in Ellen's closet, tries to trouble her husband (Barry Bostwick), kills her while she seems to be responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to make her hijack money from the company. <br /> Harris and Kelley offer competent performance, support distribution is okay and is pretty well put together, but it does not fully offset a scenario that travels through a well-worn path and offers some surprises.
