Five years after Creepshow, another sequel of horror is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is truly original or distinguished. The first story is a horror story, a story about a wooden Indian statue looking for revenge against the murderers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the owners of elderly shops. The second story, The Raft, is a story by Stephen King. It's about four teenagers who spend their free time on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, children scream in their lives as a stain of water that makes no apparent reason. However, instead of being sigh, children are caught up in a bad dialogue and a harsh behavior, preventing us from really taking care of what is going on. There is also some unintended humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-Hiker," which is actually a re-tail adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a movie with noir suspense. Then he was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode with Inger Stevens. "Hitch-hiker" is working on the best of these three deals, but it is not without a problem. Lois Chiles plays a deceptive husband who ends up running over an excursionist, she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with it or condemn it. As in many medium-sized stories of this type, the characters exist only to tell their stories with their twists and turns. The story wrapped around the aggressors seems to be a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears to be "creep" in this installment. The best thing is that there have not been any more. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
