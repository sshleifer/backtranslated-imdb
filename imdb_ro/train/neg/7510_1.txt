The film is a clich√© collection of almost anywhere. It has no focus, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotypes are abundant and scandalous. This film can not resist the temptation to make drama where it does not exist. Every little word exchange instantly transforms into a long and unreasonable dialogue that is so typical of an acting class repetition. If there is no substance in this exchange, the actors (no matter how well they are normally) can only help compensate with exaggerated emotions, ie, "raising the stakes." Over the actor, to simply say. Directing is not helpful here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, false and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in punk rock with The Who, the glittering piercings and costumes of the 1990s. Characters wander without a role, detail and reason. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights How You Sleet Like Saturday night fever, meaning and stolen art. <br /> <br /> Bine DP. I'll give that. Some movies have flaws. This film is Lee's defect. Sold, like the others. It has become irrelevant. He has nothing to say. I have no desire to see anything from this guy (which I will not call it from now on).
