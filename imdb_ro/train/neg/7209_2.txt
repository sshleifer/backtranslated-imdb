I had a fascination with the cartoon drawing in college when it was done. He had a lot of "Get Smart" charm. Although, of course, she had made mistakes, she was pretty pleasing. Of course, I was very interested in seeing the movie version. That was before I saw. After I wanted it never been done. Besides being mistaken everywhere (which on Earth, although Broderick was even close to the role?), It just did not make the quality. <br /> <The effects were reasonable and maybe only the one I liked about the film; seeing a live version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it funny or charming or interesting. The original was a cartoon with a very attentive attitude. It was fun. The film has become rather crazy and has taken too much seriously FAR. If he had a serious plot or would have been crazy to make it look like a "movie cartoon", it might have been nice. Since it does not deserve to be considered part of the "Legacy Gadget".
