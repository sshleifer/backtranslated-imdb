I just rented Creep and was not impressed at all. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking. I walked out of my living room several times in despair that something will happen to this movie. Have not I seen this before? I did not like any of the guys in the sewer. I felt sorry for him. But again, I could not think why he was still alive and was not killed by Creep? So many questions have to answer. Someone mentioned references to the Silent Hill PS2 game and can see vaguely similarities. It's not a bad movie, not a good one. Judge for yourself.
