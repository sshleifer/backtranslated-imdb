He has frequently voted the biggest film in China by Chinese critics, as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from the outside and, frankly, I do not understand at all. What we have seen was one of the most generic imaginable, carefully-crafted and actionable melodies, with a complete charade for a protagonist. Wei Wei (not laughing) is that pamper, a young married woman who has suffered with her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. She is after the Second World War and live with her husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a dilapidated house that did not have much money (the man was rich when he married). Together comes the old friend of her husband (Wei Li), who was also his wife's boyfriend when they were adolescents. She is thinking of running away from her husband with this man, while her husband remains quite flat, thinking he might hire his sister less to his boyfriend. This is the setting and it will not go anywhere you would not expect. I saw the remake directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. Time is longer than half an hour and it's actually pretty boring, but at least it was beautiful. This supposedly classic is quite intolerable.
