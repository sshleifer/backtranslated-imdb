I have a beautiful collection of movies, and that has been added. Number 274 must be exact. <br /> <br /> The title took me to the beginning. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror movie. I've ever been wrong. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I like all the movies, but it was one that was more than a laugh, then a scare. Poor sound quality, poor action and poor arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you're looking for one of those movies to have fun, then that's one!
