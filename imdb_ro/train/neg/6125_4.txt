This is the best film youngster Derek has ever done, and if you think it's a recommendation, then you have not seen each other. There are regular ingredients: it's as bad as their other efforts, we can watch Bo's despair or audition for wet sweat shirts fairly often, the story is just idiot and the movie takes too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? But he has a few things that go for that. Bo looks great, production values ​​(sets, suits, etc.) are pretty good and this greatly improves the value of the camp. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.
