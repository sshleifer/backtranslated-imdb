This is just a butchery of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the story in the book. And, there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to ask if the screenwriter even saw the first movie. Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) comes out of prison at the beginning of the original one. Here, Carlito retires with the woman in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail in Lorain, Ohio? In this tranche, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires and probably marries another girl. Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think it was in the first book. I also like Mr. Guzman playing a completely different character in this movie. He was Pachanga back in the days of Pacino. Now is Nacho Reyes, a Cuban killer. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much greater role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb come from? I also think that this film really glides over the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres writes about. And the crowd does not receive the treatment they made in the book. They are also deleted in this movie. But, magically, the Pleasant Avenue crowd is around the second film. The book has told a wonderful story. This movie could have said a wonderful story. This is just a great disappointment. Read the book. It's a better use of your time.
