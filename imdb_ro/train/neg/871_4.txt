Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town of Reverand, married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but she is also a regular woman and decides to falsify her own death to run with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, by doing so, he receives an amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old madman who pins for good Reverand in a misery of the kind "misery" kind. It's sad to see a fairly good castle scattered like this. At least a little, John Savage, in a horribly forgotten role, as a private investigator. In a movie called "black comedy," you have to bring two elements into that movie. While this brings the first to the weft, unfortunately it does not contain any of the latter. Moreover, you can not accentuate any of the characters and thus you have absolutely no interest in them. From a technical point of view, not a totally evil film is just one very ugly. Candy Eye: Dara Tomanovich becomes topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Where I've seen it: Showtime Showcase
