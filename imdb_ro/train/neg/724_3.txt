The concept of Sarafina seems to be a solid one that is beyond the musical perspective. She tried to combine optimistic African music with a story that describes the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to bear when the film was established. The contrasts of each of the two elements are too brilliant and the film does not justify such rapid changes between jubilation and terror. If it were simply a drama that reflects these conditions, it could have been a good movie, however, the scenes of school children who are shot by soldiers do not stand right next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Aside from the poor premise, the act is not the best, Goldberg offers a mediocre performance, just like the rest of the cast. In general, a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
