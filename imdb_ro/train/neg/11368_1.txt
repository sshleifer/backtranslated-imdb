This film was more effective in convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim. And I'm Jewish. Are I going to the journalism school? Read an editorial? Ancient Rhetoric? These alarmist statements, presented in a pleasant way, might prove convincing. But, without any acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, no viable solutions (or at all), few sources, and each of dubious origin make the argument an ineffective diatribue. And I thank goodness for that - I would not want anyone to leave the theater CONFIRMING any of these racist flashes. A good lesson for me - and hopefully a cautionary tale for you - to read about a movie before seeing it.
