this was the most useless movie I've ever seen that there is no plot and the actors do not seem to care. 90% of the film had no plot, I laughed so much my ribs began to last. the episode in which the elders when capturing Robert Duvall was ridiculous. at a directorial level to make a noir movie does not involve a lot of rainy and unnecessary sequences close to the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and, in turn, alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing that this was based on a "manuscript" by John Grisham, I do not see this as one of his adaptation books because he does not show any suspense and engagement as films such as "company" or "rain producer ".
