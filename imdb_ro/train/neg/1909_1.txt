One of the most serious romantic comedies (the worst, worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works like a psychic phone!) He must claim to be gay to move into the apartment with the woman of his dreams. Ranging does not happen. Boredom, gay-bathing light, and horrible dialogue does. If you read Brad Meltzer and you like his bad dialogue, you will love this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.
