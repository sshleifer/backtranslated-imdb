The revenge we could imagine the public. We stayed in this 2-hour film and we expect the second act to be released, so the film will keep its title. But Costner never avenges the fate of his loved ones and the film is over. I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge, then the hero gets better by the end of the movie. I had the choice to see this or Black Rain at the cinema, fortunately, I saw the movie of the other brothers at the cinema instead. I caught turkeys on the video. there was a good thing about the movie and it was her beautiful tone theme. Listen to the cd. 1 out of 10
