It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies. It gets worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) are a depressing curse in the room. It is regrettable that most of the films that are made annually in Romania, the worst of them are sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). This movie without a plot, actor or script is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
