I watched this movie with some friends a few months ago, I'm still laughing now thinking about total stupidity. The first few scenes were very hilarious. I will not hurt anything for those who want to see it, I would not want to destroy the laughter. Needless to say that the whole time I watched this movie, I was trying to figure out exactly what the characters of the movie did. Towards the end, we are all bored, because the hilariousness and initial shock of a movie that happened at random. There is no plot and no trace of decent action. Characters are as well developed as those in the "Learn to Read" kindergarten. They even managed to make an uninteresting lesbian sexual scene.
