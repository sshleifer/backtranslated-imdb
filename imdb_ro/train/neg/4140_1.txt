As you may or may not have heard, there is no real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. You may then wonder why the title suggested such a thing, but it is indeed somewhat appropriate, because nothing else about this movie makes any sense. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening. The actor was incredibly bad, worse than bad safe ads. Not only were there no battles between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their make looked as if they had been applied by an eight-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and out of place and included one of the characters fighting against zombies with a tundra of hedge (not joking), but they used ring sound effects. This was undoubtedly the poorest film I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance I will not totally ridicule every person responsible for producing this film is if I find out that it was produced entirely by the 11-year-old. However, with all the criticisms we offer here, I would suggest you watch this movie exclusively on the basis that it may be the worst movie ever, and for this reason it is quite comic. Even counting the defects in it should keep you entertained.
