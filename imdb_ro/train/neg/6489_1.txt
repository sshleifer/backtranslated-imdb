What seemed a good premise for a movie ... unfortunately, he fails to deliver on almost every level. Very hard to watch at the beginning of the movie, I really woke up fighting against the desire to disable the biggest visual problem is that working with the camera is simply over the top with so many joints "arty "and subliminal semi-cuts alongside the movie that actually distract you from the whole story. Try really hard to sink in the moment and build yourself to the end, but the movie has so many half-conceived characters and an irrelevant script that let you feel disappointed and confused why they tried to go so deep.
