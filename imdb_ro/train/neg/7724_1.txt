Seeing all the negative reviews for this movie, I realized it might be another comic masterpiece that was not even meant to be. I looked at the first two scenes of battle, listening to the generous dialogue offered horribly by Lungren and other Oriental orientated actors and found the movie so horrible it was fun. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the unique lines start to fly, the plot collapses, the screenwriters begin to drink, and the movie is welcome as it turns into the worst EVER action movie. Lungren overcomes his previous efforts in The Punisher and others, as well as Van Damme's films, Seagal's films and Stallone's non-Rocky films, for this distinct honor. This movie has the slightest absolute action (see Tia Carrere's face when it's in any Dolph scene that deserves a laugh) with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's commentary on Dolph is the worst line in a movie ) and the worst costume in a movie (Dolph in full Japanese clothing). The image of "Tango and Cash," with a worse action, meets "Commando," meets "Friday 13" (due to the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very similar to Jason Voorhees), in a fifteen-minute joke. The good performances (which are not terrible) go to the bad guy (who still seems constipated through his entire performance) and Carrere (who undoubtedly tells about 5 lines without laughing laughing). Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren's sidekick, and doing a very terrible job to that. A dreadful, dreadful movie. You are afraid and avoid it. If you look at it, ask why the underwater photographs are twice as sharp as most underwater photographs. Speaking of underwater photographs, check the blade water scene with the worst battle scene that ever ends. This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with a short attention and to complement the nudity flash. A BAD BAD movie !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
