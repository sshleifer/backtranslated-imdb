Why do all Lifetime movies have such anemic titles? "An unexpected love" - ​​ooh, how challenging! "Much I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. True people do not really talk that these characters and situations are really disturbing. The straight woman who "returns" lesbian seems more than the lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot women kissed in a very discreet manner, you might enjoy this. Although it seems to have been written by someone who did not really go out to notice people. Why am I missing the time to write about it?
