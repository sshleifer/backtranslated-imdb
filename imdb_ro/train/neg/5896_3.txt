A missed call, another Asian horror based on the mobile phone. Recently, I rented a Korean horror movie, based on a cell phone called "Pon". A missed call was as boring as that. Perhaps the phones are not frightening or something, but this movement was boring. There was no tension or emotion for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and uncertain. The film attracted quite a lot in different parts and felt too much. He did not pay attention to me. It looks like the phones are hard to do scary, it's like trying to make a pop machine. And it is ridiculous to compare this to the "Ring", it seems that every Asian horror movie is compared to him and so far we have not seen any measure that measures the smallest. For horror directors - remove the phone from the hook as a horror device.
