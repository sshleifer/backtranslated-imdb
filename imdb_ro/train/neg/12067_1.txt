Do you know that a movie will not work well when John Carradine tells (aka to read the script and describe the synopsis) about the funeral procession of his character, just 5 minutes into the movie. The narrative is the last will and will of his character. It stipulates that her inheritance will be shared among the four children and his servants. The children will equally divide $ 136 million, but if they are to die, then this share is shared among the rest. If all the children die, then they will be divided among the servants. In order to be eligible, they have to live in family ownership for a week. It sounds like a typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is a small subtext about the nature of the Deans. I'm a strong and very dysfunctional family, but the real problems start with drowning that dog. Since the opening of John Carradine's voice, you expect this movie to lead to a machiavellian play of cats and mice with the end of the twist. <br /> <br /> The journey is painful and useless. We were walking through the minutes of watching the people who were around, playing the pool, throwing darts, using the "fish vessels" incorrectly, dramatic conversations between the men's silk tie, constant harassment, music circulating missed, flashback- reminiscences of faux-german expressionism, the aesthetic of horror of the fourth grade and the dramatic heaps that surpass it. This inevitably leads to the expected and unreligious end. You will be happy to live, but the pain may be too great to wear alone. Share your children, share it. <br /> <br /> Celluloid Rehabilitation
