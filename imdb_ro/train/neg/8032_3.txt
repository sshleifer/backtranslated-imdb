He had a large cast of great names like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey, as well as a lot of lesser known names with shorter roles. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films he made with him in 1939. Now, the bad news ......., unfortunately, I can not say too much positive about the story. She represented the James boys in a totally positive light ... and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals always turn out to be "good boys" is beyond me. This film shines and makes their enemies - the railroadmen - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much that it was absurd. Well, that's the world of the movie for you: evil is good; well it's bad. Hey Hollywood: Here's a flash of news - James boys were criminals! Really - look for it!
