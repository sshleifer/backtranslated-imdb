this show is terrible. no comedy, no plot without good characters. America is blind to giving the prize to real shows. I hate this show with 30 rock. honestly, I'm glad they canceled the show. thanks CBS. to keep two and a half men, to keep Christine, to keep the rules of commitment to keep as I meet you with your mother, which really is not funny, but more fun than that. this show is a rupture of friends. with the same director, so it's okay. but keep this show gone and do not bring it back. never ever. the only reason why I did not give her a rating is that I was awake instead of sleeping. these are the types of movies or TV shows they give one. The only reason I was still awake was because of public laughter and I was looking forward to the next show. I really wish this show was amusing funny, but my stupid opinion. very bad. I do not see why everybody loves her. my opinion again. but I also found the big bang theory badly. my evil evil. the bye class now has a smile and it's not from watching the show.
