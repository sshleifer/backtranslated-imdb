Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it sucks long. I remember the day I first saw this on MST. The sun shone, it looked like a good day. then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane, which consisted of horrible plush dolls that did evil in the enraged surroundings of the '80s. Kevin, awesome of wussy, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages a nursing job, racing and many other things in this series of very bad pictures. No plot or story is needed. Obviously, no action is needed, as the film proves. An army guy and his crazy little girl will make you want to jump off a rock, and friend dorky, who gets sex on the phone, will make you say, "She has some red shorts." In addition, I looked at the old security guard and wanted to have an accident in the supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait until Club Scum. Ask for a road rash. I advise you to see this movie, a good month to regain your senses and health. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good shot to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
