That was recently on AMC's classic movie and I was laughing. We had great hopes for this adventure going in the direction of "Voyage to the Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island." I was very disappointed not only in acting credentials, but also in the stupid story of the story that reads from the comic book for five years. Make sure you noticed the wires of Pterdactyl's wings when they grab the pre-modern half-idiot man's "Ogar" who is fond of the lost adventures. The end has left it open to refresh the same effects in "People who have forgotten the time". Do not waste time.
