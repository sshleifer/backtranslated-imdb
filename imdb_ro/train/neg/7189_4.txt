What total disappointment! The score of 6.1 on IMDb has created some slight expectations, but, oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me is those Christians, children stereotypes university. Yeah, I know adolescents can be kids and so on, but why are they always portrayed in films like brain dead? He was a character I thought was good, but he (he did not reveal it here) was killed before the end. The other characters were badly executed and even the alleged hero / heroine just did not do it to me. On the plus side: The land is pretty good and the productions have a higher value for these types of moves. The actress was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer is in a small role. But everything fails with gentle and brave characters. Stop taking care after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and which is generous).
