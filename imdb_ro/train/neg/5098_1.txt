This must be one of the most important anime shows ever made. And yes, even the "end of the gospel" was shown to me, and that made me hate even more. Not to mention the many rip-offs of this show! I do not mind psychology and philosophy, but Evangelion pulls it in the mud as something else! Not many of the characters seemed very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Besides, especially the others were a bunch of deceptive losers. They have to go to a psychiatric center, not to run giant robots against the aliens called "Angels". Even the mecha and foreign struggles did not help at all. Go to something like that: <br /> <br /> <br /> "Well, these robots are cool and they are very cool because they bleed (!) When they are injured, but they are not really mecha, but angels, they go crazy and do not do what minor pilots want and have to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm so sorry but I can not recommend the gospel to anyone, anime otakus or not. For those who love this series very much, you are right to this opinion, I respect you. But for those who have an obsession "outside of your mind" to believe that everyone will want this series, you are more selfish. I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run-Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V".
