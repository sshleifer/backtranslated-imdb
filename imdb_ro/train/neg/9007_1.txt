This movie is one of the worst shit I've ever seen. I had a sharp headache when I was watching this movie. The CGI was terrible, and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr.-Super-Intuitive-I-can-figure-out-anything, except that he did not seem to use the helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was working with the separate screen camera. I felt like watching Brady Bunch or something else, except that there were different people in boxes, just some close points and different views of the same thing. I can only believe that actors need money, because this film does not deserve the movie in which it was shot.
