Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the tape did not bother to watch this so-called "movie." They described "intrigue and harmful choreography violence". I have not seen any "intrigue". Instead, I saw a miserable dialogue attempt in a kung fu movie. I have not seen any "violence". At least, I did not see anything that would make me suspend my distrust of what could hurt a man with "waterproof" skin - but here they can reveal too much the "plot." In addition, as a viewer of many and varied films (some of which include the occasional kung fu film), I can authoritatively say that this celluloid piece is incompetent. No matter what you choose to do, I will always remain <br /> <br /> Right, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blinded by choreography.
