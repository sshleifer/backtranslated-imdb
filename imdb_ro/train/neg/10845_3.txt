SURPRISING had a plot! ;) I saw movies with less plot (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a cheap film like this, and the atmosphere was not too bad either. There is no real reason for most of what people do and how they react to what is happening. Though I think about a lot of movies, in this case it was horrible, of course. He took such bad movies just for singular scenes. The act was bad, but I saw it worse. The movie was bad, but I've seen it worse. Watching this movie is an experience between boredom, laughter, desire for death, sadism, horniness and low-level entertainment. So if you like naked movies with stupid plots, this is the right movie for you. I gave it 3/10 because it can be fun if you do not expect to see a good movie and you're in good mood.
