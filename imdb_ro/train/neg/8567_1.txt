When we rented this movie, we had very little expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized the movie was smaller (much less) than what I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so bad ... it could work for a Disney movie (except for crimes), but this is not a comedy, it's a ridiculous masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well-chosen, except one thing: they could add a bad movie after the Husbands Dead! They give it 0 and a half of 5.
