Matt Cordell returns from the dead for the third time, though I'm not sure nobody cares about this point, except for the anger of MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, is resurrected through voodoo and is now hot on the trail of several mistakes involved in shooting a fellow officer whom Cordell really likes. I lost some of this little amount of time this year in the early 90's, but it was nice to see Cordell twisting his body in different, frightening ways. The problem is that the movie is pretty static, and Cordell just is not Jason or Freddy. Interest is flowing pretty quickly, even with the great film master, Robert Forster, as a doctor who ends up with his brain. Stick with the first movie in the series, which is fun and scary, all at the same time.
