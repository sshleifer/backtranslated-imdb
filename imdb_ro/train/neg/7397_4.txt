I've seen this movie several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always makes me feel like I saw a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> For a school movie it is very well produced and directed, but the story ... and it took something else to be a bigger and more exciting movie. The character called Tim Watcher needed an in-dept approach. This is something she misses in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. But still ... I liked this movie ... Parabians! (Congratulations!)
