TV pilots, do not you love them? Quinn Martin tried this after he succeeded in a bunch of detective TV movies, but this is not going anywhere, except for the MST where he belongs to. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who receives orders from Aunt Mary to find the super spy Lovejoy, that is, Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic relief and no more. The tree sucks like a bad guy, despite all the disguises that make it look exactly the same as normal. There are more unusual clothing fibers than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970s), and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not he go to the evening? You realize, it's very obvious. Again, it's fun for MST, but there's not much more!
