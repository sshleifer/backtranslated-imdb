Just an awesome movie. Stanwyck's son gets his leg caught in a really bad way, and then his husband gets his foot caught in a very bad way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck becomes unlucky once again, and meets a convicted escape. He has the chance to kill him, but he does not succeed in a very bad way. Finally, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us by story what is the bad message of the movie. Everything is better than it is bad. I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made her a top lady in the golden age of Hollywood's beloved one; that the nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The film is short, with a short time. It's as if the director felt shit, so he thought it better to keep the short bits.
