I saw this movie in 1979, when I was 17 or 18 when he was released. The theater was probably 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes in the movie and the friend who went with me to see the movie were the only two people in the theater. The movie was really weird and had no plot or reason for his script, and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the movie ... why should you tolerate such torture? ... here's why. We wanted to be true film critics ... to have a standard to rely on all the other movies that it's hard to justify by saying that you saw the best movie (a 10) always come with something better. But, it's easy to rely on all the other movies on the worst movie ever made (and that's ... at least 1). There may be other movies that really qualify as 1, but I have not seen them yet. Now they are the basis of all the movies I see on a scale based on this worst ... I AM CRITICAL OF THIS MOVIE ... he.
