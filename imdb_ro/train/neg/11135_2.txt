What can I say? The act was, almost without exception, amateur. Direction and continuity were pitiful. Sceenplay was predictable until the last scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the features of the DVD was called "Gag Reel," but it could have been a description of the spectator's response to most of the movie. One of the funniest things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said, with a straight face, that he left to make a film with high production values ​​and a distribution of names - and that he succeeded. With such illusions, it is easy to understand how the film turned out the way it was. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The Darkwolf costume was a modified monkey suit (depending on the "make" feature on DVD) and looked at it rather. The mask and the claws were slightly better than those on the shelf at any costume shop. The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of a quality like a cheap video game.
