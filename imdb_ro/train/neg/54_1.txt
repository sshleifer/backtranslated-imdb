The only good thing about this movie was shooting Goldie Hawn at her feet in her little bikini briefs cut in French and trying to keep a dozen other women depraved by removing her little cotton tip while she was chuckling and roaring . Ooooof! Her thighs rival with those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen, and almost shot that she killed me. I forgot all that remained in my wonderful rodel of mind until I saw her the next day on television, where they actually blackened their midst in that scene, a good pain, reminding me of the boiling of a Goldie Hawn woman was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
