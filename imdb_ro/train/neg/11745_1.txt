The fact that I did not like music is a very personal opinion, historical inaccuracies are not. I realize it is a work, not a documentary, but some important issues are missing, especially if other people are falsely commenting on it. Abbu Abas was the leader of this operation, which was staged and reorganized for discovering aboard the ship to release 50 Israeli prisoners, one of whom was Samir Kuntar, a staggering terrorist whose story you find looking for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas has been responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he has never set foot on Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never put his foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did they? <br /> <br /> *** Possible Spoilers *** The film almost apologizes for the actions and reactions of the terrorists because of the horrors they might have lived, always emphasizing and exaggerating how much the Israelis have done for them wound. However, they never describe the evil that the Palestinians have ever provoked the Israelis. The film uses images (horrible) of the Sabbath and Chatila horror, and nothing is said, underlining the general belief that Israel was responsible, not to mention that it was a Syrian-Lebanese army that led the massacre. The actor was generally very bad, but I think that's what one can expect from opera singers? In another note, I am shocked by the way a person can apologize to the terrorists for killing a hostage because the hostage tried to shake the 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists and added that the person should not be considered sympathetic because it is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how unsatisfactory his wife was, spitting out the terrorists who shot her husband and threw him into the sea. I hope nobody in the world is not as cruel as she (wink wink)
