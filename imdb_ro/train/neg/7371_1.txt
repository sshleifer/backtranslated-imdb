Steven Seagal .... how could you have been part of such an awful movie? I hired this movie because your movies were pretty clean. I lost much respect because you were in a terrible movie like this one. Taste very, very weak! I'm embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you keep playing in movies like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I were glad to watch many of your movies because you can always "make the guy bad" with a few maneuvers and make him clean ... and also the tongue is pretty clean in your movies ... but that's different. I'll think twice before I rent a new one of yours.
