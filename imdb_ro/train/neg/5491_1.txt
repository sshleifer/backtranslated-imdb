We should have been suspicious that we discovered that only two minutes lit us, we were alone there. Only five others joined before the film began. There is nothing to redeem this movie. The act is terrible (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is trivial. The effects I've seen a million times. The movie is the worst I've ever seen. Meandering and disjoined. Nobody laughed, including the children. I left after 25 minutes. It would have been earlier if my wife had not left for a hot dog! <br /> <br /> Do not waste money on this movie. If you do not have anything to look at at the cinema, then you buy some drinks, popcorn and warm dogs and you forget some people. You will have a much more enjoyable time! <br /> <br />
