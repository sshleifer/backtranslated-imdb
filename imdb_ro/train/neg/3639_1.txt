This movie sucks from the beginning to (especially) the end. Probably not worse, actors, story, photo, thing with the camera, etc. Besides, it's very bad, very, very bad. But that's what makes a great watch, it will give you much more than good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what ever they were from what these people were thinking about making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is ridiculous, it's rather a disguised comedy, like a Mafia, too futile, but damn funny. And look at the end of the movie ... uhum.
