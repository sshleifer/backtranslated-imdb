Thank God! I did not waste my money to rent it, but I downloaded it! This is going to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, with visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Apart from other zombie movies, like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are a lot of loop holes and mistakes in the movie. OK if you have time after reading this comment, please check Ulli Lommel's profile. After seeing that I have a self explanation, why is the movie so, I mean every film directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to look for what movies are directed by him, but you can end all this by saying a strong sentence. Even for fun or passing time or even in an extremely bored situation please do not WATCH THIS FILM.
