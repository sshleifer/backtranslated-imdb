This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised by the level of talent of great names that would agree to appear in a piece of junk like that. I imagine there were a few strangled agents along Hollywood Blvd as a result of this fiasco. What really makes you think it could have been good. The directors turned to a star and the subject was enough to boost interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. Multiple story lines go from evil to stupidity to the end of the images and you feel like a mouse in a labyrinth looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. What Spike is capable of doing is revenge against any Italian who would have beaten him when he was a kid or insulted, because the film does quite a lot about the perpetuation of outdated and perhaps offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there are a number of really challenging and magical things. He has the gift of catching your psyche and carrying you in his vision if it's just for some memorable scenes. But the question remains ... you can withstand the other 2 hours of scratches on your head and watch as you ask and wait for the end to be there somewhere.
