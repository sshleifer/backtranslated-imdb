Visually revealed and self-righteous, the director apparently chose to look for a false depth to extend a 5-minute plot in a 81-minute snoring-fest. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this film are very limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How did you feel invested in a leading protagonist who was so surreal? <br /> <br /> Substantially and stylistically, it all resembles a strange dream sequence. Permanently unauthorized camera work, strange silence and gaps in action, and what happens to the image of the spider crawling on the screen? Anyone who thought about this should go back to film school. It did not add any meaning, just cheese, nor worked stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming that the movie had a style that is almost a call). What a flop.
