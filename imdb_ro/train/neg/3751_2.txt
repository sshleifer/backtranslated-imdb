I'm a great fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Besides ambient background music? which really sets the mood of the film? he lacks almost all the qualities I have come to associate with Lynch's work. Visuals are boring at least, and dialogue is vague and monotonous to be of interest. This feels more like an inconvenient movie of students trying to make an artistic dogmatic film than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with superior camera activity, a scene, a sound, and a script. This film has almost no artistic qualities. I feel like I'm watching one of Davids' home movies produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
