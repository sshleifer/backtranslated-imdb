A snow blow, made in the early 80's, has a curse on him, who has someone who tries to finish him to become dead. Years later, a group of students tried to complete the film - also reviving the curse of death. The ideal idea for a movie, but unfortunately "Cut" is just another scattered opportunity. Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best results in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was a villain, like "Holwing III" (1987), which was anyway a half-American film. As for our horror comedy, "Body Melt" (1993) is the best forgotten. The problem with "Cut" is that the producers are trying to create a satire of intelligent horror at 'Scream' (1996), but they have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And though this sounds weird to say this about a slasher movie, but what "Cut" really has no "heart". Of course he follows the basic rules set by "Scream", but he does not want to play with the formula, but a copy of the earlier card. The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncarismatic in horror film history. Its endless dam, with elastic blades, would make the dialogue of a porn look like Shakespeare. Distribution does not seem to be fully involved and looks like theirs waiting for a shoot to end, so they can collect their paychecks. And the sensation of the film is as if deliberately intended not to be creepy; looks more like an episode from "Neighbors" or "Heartbreak High". By the way, those MTV-style, hyper-cinema attempts during the "research" sequence show only blades, dated and out of place. If Australia ever has a chance to make horror again hopefully we're still doing) maybe we should take a leaf from Mad Max (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try to take our own genre.
