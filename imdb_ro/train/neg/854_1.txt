Ladies and gentlemen, please do not be fooled by the film A Stanley Kubrick. This is a very bad movie that unfortunately was considered one of the most deadly horror films ever made. Horror films should create such a fear that people should shake their hearts while thinking about a real horror movie. In Shining, there is no real horror, but what we find in return is just a naive, crazy attempt to create some horror. Everyone knows how well the trials are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the movie is the view of the frozen valley. The hotel where the majority of the actors were imprisoned seems too good. A word about actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who is never sure of what he should do. There is not much to say about a bald, colorful actor who is often busy spoiling a child actor. I do not have to blame bad weather for tragedy. Can not be avoided because the movie was made and Kubrick the poor is not alive to make changes.
