SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she mistakenly believes Jed has an affair with one of her two friends. Kate thought he had caught him deliciously flagrant. Kate threw Jed's shoes off the door. Jed goes badly and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes. Then he went over ("crushed", one of the title's meaning) by a truck. And he dies. And then he ran with a truck. Can you imagine a script writer actually presenting a script with this plot element? Until then, a comedy that plans to be sparkling, but has no real physics. Everyone, except Jed, is just annoying. And then I'm killing Jed and everyone is sad, until the end of the galaxy's learning to love one another and to be supporters rather than destructive. I give him 2 ugh.
