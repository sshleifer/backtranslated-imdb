Go right and rent this movie. It will be on a lower shelf in your local video store and will be covered with dust. Nobody will touch it for years. It can even be a special $ 50! I'm worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films to compare with - the celluloid version of the goo that forms at the base of a garbage after a few years. Yeah, I gave it a "1", but it's really worth a lot smaller. 1-10 scales have not been designed with such things in mind.
