If I had only one room that was accidentally glued to the floor, enough film for a single hit of each movie, and then lost all the movie and had to scrape some money to buy some digital video tapes and was forced to do a movie over 2 hours about the French Revolution and also did not have sets and had to have my autistic son of 4 years paint the background and also the only actors I could find were those who did not, make the soap auditions of that year, and I was forced not to use any music in the whole movie, and also the zoom function of the camera only worked once when the magnification accidentally started and could not stop oh, and if I hate my audience, then I would do something like that terrible, but deceptively hilarious, loss of time. The backdrop of almost the same appearance, but completely fake, reminded me of some of George Lucas's latest creations, which made it more disappointing because in the whole movie there was that little glow of hope in my mind that the film climax in a laser duel / laser space battle. I do not want to destroy the movie for those who did not see it, but that's not over. The only thing I can think he has lost more time than watching this movie wrote this review. Peace.
