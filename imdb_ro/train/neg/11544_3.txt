He was really looking forward to watching this, because I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then he quickly jumps to the main plot, which is attacked by a group of strangers, and Dyer is beaten extremely bad while Anderson is raped. Then he decides to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it is not. The story becomes boring and traced, and some things are really strange. I will not give details, but things happen that I, for myself, do not want to see. I like to give all the films the advantage of doubt and I really wanted to like this. It simply did not work. I give her 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
