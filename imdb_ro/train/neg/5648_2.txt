Boston legally turned his tail and headed for the door of the barn and the pig pig he had created! When this show was broadcast for the first time almost four years ago, it was a humorous joke to the legal system that all actors seem to boast of portraying. It was fun, diversified, and to some extent factual. The portrayed characters were acceptable and to some extent real in their portraits. Comments and sexual activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen has been and has been beautiful as in the other series she attended, but now she is dragged to the smallest depths of sex media programming and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production." Rene Adjurdubois He is an excellent actor who, since Benson's production, has retained his own role in entertainment, always showing humor and respect for production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and she has to be admired because she continues in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his ability to act, yet he should return to the origin of XXX, such as "Crash," because he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We're asking for this series to be drawn as it already is, and it starts to smell!
