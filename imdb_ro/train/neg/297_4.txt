For recording, this movie is intriguing, but hardly original. In 1998, a film with Talia Shire, called The Landlady, had almost the same plot, but with younger characters. The story is that Amanda Lear had a bad life, an abusive father, a horny doctor, and so on. Eventually, she is released from the happy house under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... who analytically abuses and kills the poor guy. (now that it was original) The doctor funded a mansion for her before he killed him and buried the sucker in the yard. After she moved, she fell in love with a boy named Richard, who just married a blues singer. If you saw The Landlady, you know the rest, kill or try to kill someone who is between her and Richard (including a roadie). Much of the idea came from the previous movie, The same idiot who squeezes his nose, the same spy on the guy with a popcorn bowl, the same thing flying with a body press. He had an original material, working with the beer glass was brutal. The climax of the film was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the scene. Somewhat a waste, but not a total waste of time. 4 out of 10
