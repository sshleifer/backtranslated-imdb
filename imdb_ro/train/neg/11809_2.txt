He bought this movie in the Rogers Video store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie from time to time and I realized that this looked like a good one. The film is quite cliche "1970's" and is pretty groovy for that. Unfortunately, the story line is hard to follow and there is not much happening in the movie. In fact, I stopped it after seeing it for 45 minutes and I realized a week later that I should look at the whole thing no matter how slow it was. The movie has good points in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. If you are in B movies, this could be just for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not too much is really going on, and I do not mention any line of story too ... <br /> <br />
