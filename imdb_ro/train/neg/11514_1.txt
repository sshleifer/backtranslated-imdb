Undoubtedly, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought they would help their career. If you went through the "Swept Away," then you know that at that level was a game made in hell. After almost 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress," as she said in "The Next Best Thing"), she can not get out of her long enough to turn it into - the taste could even call it decent. And that's what makes people do not like it so much on the screen: that feeling of emotion that her self is so bloated that she prevents her from letting go and connect with her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, she breathes the last chance.
