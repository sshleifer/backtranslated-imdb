I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedies and I've probably seen several Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every movie he made from the beginning of his career until the early 30's, with just two exceptions, we've reviewed so you can say I'm a big fan. That's why I found this episode so painful and hard to follow. I liked the human movies and I thought "Buster, how could you?" Well, now that I think about it, I think I understand why Buster Keaton played in this terrible episode of the god of the TWILIGHT area. He lost much of his fortune after a disordered divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career as a leading man has long passed. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money, and he would have liked to revive his popularity, so he was braving anyone who wanted to pay - appearing in beach movies and this disaster of a big episode series. <br /> <> The biggest problem with the episode is that it's just very written and that Buster deserves much better. The show should be fun, but it's not just a homage to silent movies, it's just painful to watch - especially when Keaton put on his warm shirt in time, and all the poorly executed. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - is a pale imitation of greatness that once was Keaton's career!
