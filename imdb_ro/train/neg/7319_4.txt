when you get to scenes involving Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to poke on a fur ball. I like Albert Brooks. I've seen the most, if not all of his movies, but it was the first time I saw this one. Modern Romanticism is an interesting step on the theme of love. There are few movies that deal with desperation of love or as open as Modern Romance, although 1979 "Chilly Scenes of Winter" comes very close. Both of them deal essentially with obsessed men who are too attracted to their respective women. Where - when the Chilly of Winter scenes fall into this subject, this movie has a more groundbreaking foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and from the relationship .. and back to it again. And because it is a movie that was released in 1981, it's since then in terms of styles and the like. This is the main reason why I like this movie. My basic rule, when it comes to movies, is "If shit can at least have historical relevance," you know things while in the capsule. Which leads me to the dreadful scenes of Albert Brooks's shirt. <br /> <br /> Man is hair. Very hair. As if wearing a black-haired fur hairdresser. And what is worse is that almost looks burned victim-hairy. It is not a pleasant sight, and scenes with him without a continuous and continuous shirt. Back to the men's hairdos of the 80's were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, looking at such a thing is just revolting. I'm sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone to say, "Let's try this scene, but with you wearing a simple T-shirt, that means you could scare people." It's very bad and I'm sorry for the poor actress who had to deal with Albert Brooks's naked body on top of her. She probably got her hair out of her teeth after a few days. Still, it's a good movie. It could have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 minutes long, because that will affect me for ever watching this movie.
