What happens to the Americans and their closure with gobbledy-gook? Thinking it's a best selling novel is incredible, but to shoot it like a movie, you need a good action and script to deliver it. In this case, all the good actors went to the sky and stayed with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!) Trying to discover why many people simply disappeared.

The good news is that this is so cheap and, with such an unexpected dialogue, that it has a total entertainment value in all its unintentional laughter. Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ.
