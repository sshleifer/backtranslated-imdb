You can not go too far when the original story is not all great. The premise of cyborg need is just dopey. The script is blas√©. "The actors do not have much to do, the sets have been organized in the desert to reduce costs, it is a trademark that if the fund is desert, then the movie has no budget. there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from $ 1, but this film looks as if they had to overthrow their change together just to buy a cameraman a sandwich. if only the story was not simply sucking.Finally, this film is committing the greatest crime of all: It does not end! It just ends up as if it were a commercial break to the rest of the film But the rest He's never coming in. Just weird.
