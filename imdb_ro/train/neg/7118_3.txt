I could not tell if "The Screaming Skull" is trying to be a hit from Hitchcock or a modernized tribute to Edgar Allen Poe. Nowadays, someone would have cut him off a bit and portrayed him as one of the episodes of the TV anthology in the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after a great rewrite. <br /> <br /> It is a sad thing, there seems to be a beautiful, ugly story that tries to get out of the underground of this movie, and the actors make obvious what they can, both with the talent and the material they need to work. But the director just did not know how to create or run a dramatic scene; the special effects simply did not work; the scenario telegrades its delicate plot points, so clear that a bivalve would have seen them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play the German "oompah band" when it was supposed to try to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried very hard. But this is of interest only as a part of the period. I suppose someone very young who would not have seen a lot of suspense or horror could get a fee from "The Screaming Skull", but someone who probably will not get the majority of the subtext or plot for the plot. ("Mother, why is that cute man trying to scare the lady with stray cat?")
