HERA PHERI from Priyadarshan was a pleasant sitcom comedy. The film has a story, but it's funny, but it's illogical. In fact, it's not a fair story, but it does manage a nice flow, although it's not great. The first half has two funny scenes like Akshay and John invite on Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though it's not a script <br /> <br /> Funny jokes though somebody wonders how I never hear the voices of every person inside the rooms? Confusion of the climax is treated as a gift but it is quite funny But the film ends abruptly Direction is fine Music is good Akshay Kumar excels in his part, which is now his second skin but this is his complete film and he Shame everyone else <br /> <br /> John hates all the time and fails in the comedy Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is ok The girls would be sometimes noisy and weird Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is seen now) are good in the parts, but they yell too often Manoj Joshi is fine
