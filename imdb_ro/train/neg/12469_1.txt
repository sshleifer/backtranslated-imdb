I rarely give up a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rent it on DVD. Siriana was one that I gave up. Halfway I stopped her in bored disgust. This movie is disjointed, boring, confused and devoid of scope. The act was dry and without credible portraits. The general experience was good, but it evolved in such a tedious and boring manner that it failed to attract my attention or interest. Multiple subcategories failed to connect with each other and seemed more like random stories than a real plot. Too bad a subject and actors so great that it could create such a flop. I can not imagine that this film receives any nomination much less a prize.
