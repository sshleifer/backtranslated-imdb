This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and the equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle with a small Falk thrown inside. Wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you hardly know. I suppose Reiser has the impression that he's a giant film star who needs a suitable vehicle. He is not. Even more mistaken is that Reiser has made it difficult to hire some of the best actresses of the characters on the screen today and then defeating everyone in the background. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when he does, the screen shines. The story is about Falk and Dukakis really, but we are subjected to an unnecessary, stupid and absurd journey, in which Reiser gets to look as cute, precious and oh so deep, with psychological understanding (wrong!) He can be. For example, In a restaurant scene that I imagined Reiser saying it was "Cassavetes-like," there is a false confusion between Reiser and Falk, which is so obviously ridiculous, I was embarrassed by Falk .
