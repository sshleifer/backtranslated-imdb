Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the Home Alone Empire. Four industrial spies acquire a rocket guiding computer chip and introduce it to an airport in a remote-controlled toy car. Due to baggage confusion, Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) becomes a car. He gives his neighbor, Alex (Linz), even before the spies come back. Spies rent a house to destroy every neighborhood house until it locates the car. Only at home with varicella, Alex calls 911 every time he reports a theft, but spies always manage to get rid of the police, while Alex is accused of making joking calls. Eventually, the spies turn their attention to Alex, not knowing he has the false devices to crash his entire house. Singles 3 was not horrible but probably should not have been done; you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 has some funny parts, but I do not like the characters being changed into a series of movies at their own risk.
