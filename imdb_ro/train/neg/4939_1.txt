See this! As everyone knows they rely on some Geico insurance ads; what nobody knows is why ?! These commercials were fun on the first view at best; hard to feed for a series. (Geico gecko speaking - this is another story. Now, that would do for an intriguing series!) And why on earth ABC - as reported in the press - actually agrees to buy the character rights for Geico caverns for this? After all, the idea of ​​cemetery people struggling in the modern world is almost unique to television; Phil Hartman played a recurring role as Saturday Night Live as Unknown Caveman Advocate over a decade ago. And so this concept works best - as an occasional rate. But an ordinary series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A series of 1960s called "It's about Time" also used cavemen in the concept of a modern world, lasted a season.) One of the show's directors, who was also responsible for Geico's commercials, was recently quoted as saying: "We were so excited when we filmed our commercials because we felt that we had something very unique and had bigger stories to tell." In the annals of the evil TV, it is intended to take its place alongside "Me and Chimp" in 1972 as one of the worst. The main actor of the embarrassing Chimp fiasco was shamefully disguised after the association was abruptly aborted. Undoubtedly, our cave friends will follow the example.
