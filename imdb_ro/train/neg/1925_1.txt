Ron Howard did that? The 1966 potato charmer is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with whos, greedy, manipulative and self-centered. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the scenario has imagined the most frightened person, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is the magic of the movie. Like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Grinch from Carrey is so dissatisfied that any degree of comedy that can be extracted from his character simply evaporates. If the cartoons of 1966 featured a Grinch we could all identify with, Grinch of Carrey is that old and angry old man I saw at a time in a car parked , mumbled or shot his children at the supermarket's reed. This Grinch is completely devoid of any kind of humanity, humor or understanding, and his redemption at the end of the movie is useless. The whole movie sounds fake: there is a bad Christmas lighting competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a villain by digging his childhood and an unbelievable mystery as to why some of those who have this strange expansion of the lip, of them not. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine that children would find this film tedious, irritating, and full of contradictory messages. Do we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his unrelated relatives. Discover the jokes of jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes and other mandatory Carreyesque low-humor forehead, and you have a movie that is just as far from cartoons since 1966 (or a book that inspired her), as George W. Bush is rational, lucid thinking. Take a look at this big turkey.
