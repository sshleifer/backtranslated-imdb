A rich print from Harvard falls for a poor Radcliffe cat, very much for the dismay of his daddy (Ray Milland). Sirupea, sugar and, above all, sappy story about a "class" battle when Ryan O'Neal, the rich child, brings home a librarian for his parents to ridicule. Ali MacGraw is social imprisonment with a dirty mouth, while John Marley plays the role of his devoted Catholic father, but no one in the movie is much more annoying than O'Neal himself, with his whimpering portrait as Harvard yuppie champion. > It was 8 (!) Years later of Oliver's Story.
