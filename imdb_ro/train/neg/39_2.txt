An actress who makes a film in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is held for ransom. The manufacturer hires some to go and bring it back. Complicating everything is jungle cannibals that worship a nasty "god" who likes to eat naked women. This is a bad movie. There are abundant amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. His exploitation film, designed to appeal to the darkest parts of our being, and if the film was not so boring, this movie would be a classic. Make your face, despite gore, ugly sex and abuse, and ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. Pacing is completely disordered and pulls you out. There are several plot lines that all seem to happen apart from each other, even if ultimately all of a story. The worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue refers to cruelty or personal protests that "do what I want". His film so quiet and boring that if it were not for the frequent sparks of the victims, I would recommend this as a sleeping aid. This is a movie to avoid if you do not need sleep or unless you have to see each euro-cannibal movie. (Once, VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series, imprinted with strange letters, which seems to be the result of picking up their print from a Japanese source (no mug) that was cut to remove subtitles, and their printing has no opening titles)
