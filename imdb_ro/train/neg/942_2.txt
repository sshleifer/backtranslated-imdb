She saw her late one night on the cable. I did not know at that time that Shannon Wilsey was actually a pornographic woman, Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and she was stripped so often, thanks to God) that I actually stood in this rotting movement. I like the knife movements as much as the next guy - more than the next one in fact - but that was far more than cheesy and more in the rancid. The really annoying mistake by the crazy scientist and the director, the writers and the special effects, the total incompetence of the people, escapes free nudity, which is the only salvation grace of the film. Savannah, before turning into a plasticized Barbie doll, she became a pornographic queen, she is very interesting to look - she is super dirty, sometimes bursts into uncontrollable chic, looks out of the room and laughs and generally seems to have a very good moment, which is more than can be said for the public. Because although Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount on this naked picture, she can not hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, stupid and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on the video or if it comes over the cable one night, check it out, but do not waste your rented money.
