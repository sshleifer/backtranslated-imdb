WWF Survivor Series 2001 This was one of the worst events since 2001. Perhaps his biggest flaw was that he did not follow the example of most of the previous Survivor series. It was just one survival game. And the Survivor series continued for 45 minutes. Moreover, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with The Rock versus Austin and the Rock that predominates for his team. And do not make me start with the preview before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to die. It did not take all this unnecessary hype. Whatever the story was, it was just a wrestling event. And with regard to the rest of the matches: the first match was the Christian who defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good match fast rhythm and his good to see a heel winning a pretty match. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and I saw him 2 or 3 times before. Edge vs. The test was good, but it was not great. The title of the "steel cage" tag was the best match of the evening. The Battle of Royal continued for 10 minutes and nobody cared who will win first. The match of the female title was not great. No, not to the least. The main event must have been the most hypocritical match in history. The Alliance lost, but guessed what, after 5 months, every Alliance superstar came back. The match itself was weak. The rock has eliminated 3 of them, and Jericho has removed 2. The rock was too caught with its role of being there when the invasion began. It was Jericho who threatened the whole game. If I wanted any 2 to be removed while she was going, they would be. Everyone knew Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just autumn guys. 7 matches are not enough for a series of survivors. If there's ever a Survivor Series just as bad as that, I'll do it
