***** probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say I liked it, but I can not say that I ... very strange. It has bad things, like a shark that has gone out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were the director, I would have cut that part of course, it gave me the need to stop I see the rest of the film. .. For some people will be boring because it has action, it sometimes feels home made ... Take for example a scene that one of the friends died and the next thing I do is what? nop, do not cry ... their horror stories tell each other .. * sighs * (immediately after crying for his loss) <br /> <br /> Another thing wrong was when they spoke inside the boat who had "hundreds of mass candles in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by rags of rags (old cloths covering the windows) and sofas / tents ... I thought she was stupid using candles, but I do not think the surroundings, besides being just great ... <br /> <br /> Best, some frightening scenes are well done I liked some. Sometimes horror works better when it's hidden when it's in behind something instead of showing, so this movie does well, maybe because a low budget I do not know but it works well for me! You will feel the tension if you forget some holes like the ones mentioned above Do not wait too long! if you like any movie f ilm watch it, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry about my english gross) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
