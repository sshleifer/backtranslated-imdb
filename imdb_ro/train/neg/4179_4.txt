# 1 Vampiri vs. People <br /> <br /> # 2 The rebellious squadron team as the first to respond to dangerous, unknown Vampire incursions. The sexy female vampire on the side of the "Good Boys". <br /> <br /> # 4 A lot of gore and action. There are four (4) major devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device can not discourage you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In the outer space <br /> <br /> The last ones almost caught me too, but I I'm glad I saw. In a hell of horror directed to video, which is the Halloween marathon for Sci-Fi ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. Will stop against any other Sci-Fi channel offers, and even against the other Vampire movie, Natassia, played in (which continues to give money to Uwe Boll?).
