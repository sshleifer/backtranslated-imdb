The film did what she wanted to do: it shows how a little girl is facing poverty and matures. However, for most of us, this subject has been properly explored and, in most cases, more sophisticated than he did here. The movie fixed on the breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If it had been on TV, I'd have switched to the latest news from the Starr report. So boring we found this movie.
