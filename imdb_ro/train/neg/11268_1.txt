We hoped the film would be at least visible. The plot was weak to say at least. I was expecting to think much more about the distribution line (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?). At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the film is certainly Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is Full and Total Shoes.
