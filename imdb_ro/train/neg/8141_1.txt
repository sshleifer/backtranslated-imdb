Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, just who in the world is verifying this shit. A newborn couple goes to spelunking in the honeymoon, attacks bats and her husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? I'm in the desert, then skiing, then I'm in a small town that seems to have mountains nearby. The city is led by a sheriff who likes to look and has a personal vendetta against the little doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice mustache and his wife looks like Maria Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There is no dramatic tension, and the end will leave you full of anger. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston made the effects for this movie. I think you have to start somewhere.
