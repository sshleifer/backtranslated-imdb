This movie was sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The act was atrocious, the intrigue completely implausible. A long and long story, these people are "terrorized" by this "mad madman" killer, but they can not fight in any way. And after they took a cork on a camping trip without any tools, and they show up in a camping which is already assembled and fully loaded with food, and the clothes and the headphones. In addition, after the boat disappears, they panic they are stuck in the woods, but then the friend of the daughter appears and never seems to think that she could leave the forest as if she had done it to get to they. As I said, this movie is shit. A total joke. Do not let your girlfriend talk to you.
