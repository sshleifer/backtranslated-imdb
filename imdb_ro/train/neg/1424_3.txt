The film has a good start, portraying an interesting and powerful Shannon Lee and introduces two extremely sympathetic characters in the first half of the year. But later on, something happens and suddenly Shannon turns into this second-hand, straight-faced girl, and the film is lost in its own context. The second half has no charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad action, horrible plot, and even better co-ordination of cascades. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. "Game of Death 2" was bad and clowned by Bruce, but his daughter made a bigger embarrassment than her double played by Bruce Lee at the time. I really believe she can do much better than that and I hope to participate in a better production next time. If you are a true fan of action and you do not care about quality go forward and see this movie. It was personally looking forward to it, but I was just very disappointed.
