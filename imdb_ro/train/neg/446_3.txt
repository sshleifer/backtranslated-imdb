It was disappointing. It started quite well, but as it continued and lost any opportunity to grow, it fell. Maria Schrader's acting is terrible, it does not seem to mean what she says or even know what she's saying until she says it. She did not show any genuine emotion, not for her beloved lover or for her mother's story. When, with Lena, she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There is never a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that her mother seemed to have fun at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hanna's "mixed" romanticism and her mother's relationship with her father was as sharp as they did, and she could not be miserable, anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and ended with a fool. The culmination of the protest was not helpful, and no matter what Lena did or did not to influence the outcome, she would certainly have shown a complexity of time sensation, a haunting look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the movie had any depth or sparkle. It was very hard to care about any of them, even Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why disappointed him when the hotel phone rang? There was no context or explanation for that.) If any reference to him was removed, he would not have noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story made confused by the poor evolution of the character (who was whose mother, again?), acting weakly and directing it, made everyone seem to have acted. You almost heard "quietly on the stage! ..." I began to think that she was worthy of a 7, but as the movie continued, it quickly dropped to 4, after which she won 3 after the peak of the wedding. It was an as cold and sterile movie, as we have seen. A terrible waste of good story.
