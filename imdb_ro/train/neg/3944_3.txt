My Name's Modesty is based on an episode of about one page in the 10th modest novel, Blaise, called Night of the Morningstar. She describes an incident in which young Modesty (17 in the book, twenty years in the film) asserts his leadership in a war on a casino. As it happens before Blaise's adventures, Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, since the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the fascinating aspects of novels and comic stripes. The other problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring, because it's really just a small episode in a script. Casting is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the youngster to play Modesty. I have the impression that this movie was a quick and dirty solution to not lose the Blaise franchise rights.
