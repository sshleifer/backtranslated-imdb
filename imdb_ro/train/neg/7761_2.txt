After a series of energy interruptions in a zoo on the remote island, genetic engineering sabertooth tigers lie on the island's inhabitants. Man, the SF channel has made some "original" bad movies, but I think this could be the worst so far! Rip-off "Jurassic Park", written and directed, offers all the usual clich√©s (crazy scientists who think people killed by monsters are "consumable losses," characters who walk alone on dark, teenage hallways, the movie is to die a horrible death, etc.) and, of course, no suspense. The special effects are atrocious - the head bracelets of the title bracelets are pretty bad, look like rigorous dolls, but the CGI that makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" shows that life by comparison is just straight. There are some gore, but most of them seem rather unconvincing. Oh, and the scene of the death of the scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I have seen over the years. I could not even laugh it was so bad! Do not waste your time, this is really stupid. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here's some interesting trivia for you, this movie borrowed musical milestones from the 2003 Alien Hunter SF, which was far superior to that piece of nonsense.
