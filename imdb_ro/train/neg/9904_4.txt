The film "Gung Ho!": Carlson's Maksin Island Raiders' story was made in 1943 in order to raise the morale of the American people during the Second World War. It shows with the best way that the cinema can be a propaganda body. The value of this film is only collection and not artistic. In a propaganda film, it is useless to judge the direction and the actors. Watch that movie if you're interested in how propaganda works in movies or if you're really fun with Robert Mitchum, who has a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, they are much better and more objective. I rated her 4/10.
