I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I have not seen the movie until late, and I watched it in advance to see my memories resumed again, because I loved the original show. Imagine my disappointment. This must be the slightest translation of a Broadway show for the movie ever made. They changed the story, changed the songs, lost the soul. I was expecting a trip in memory, singing to Music and an extraordinary moving mirror, In the ballet and Hello Twelve, Hello thirteen. Not! Not only did they mock the music at an almost unrecognizable point, but they broke the story by adding songs and lines (which were not present in the original) and injected "drama" where it was not necessary. The original had enough pathos on his own. If you were a fan of the show on Broadway, do not bother. I'm sorry I wasted my time, and I diluted my memories, looking at this shit.
