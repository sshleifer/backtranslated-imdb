Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (the murdered killer commits murder, Columbo smokes the killer, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), writers never manage to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in the extreme and the result is a major flop. <br /> <br /> Do you think that Columbo never faces the evil all the way? <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was tempted to stop him for two-thirds through. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we have made from us!
