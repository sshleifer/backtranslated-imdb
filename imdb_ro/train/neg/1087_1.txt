This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While presenting good actors, the film does not meet the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is music, which pretty much compares the film: it compensates for a bad and confusing story by having seen good actors, strong and dramatic music. It does not change the fact that it is a very boring film to watch. She earned a score of 1.
