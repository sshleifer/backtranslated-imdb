This was the best movie I've ever seen! Molly (moth room) could not act at all! she had no emotion was everything blah blah blah as she was read from a boring book book. The intelligent child and the child who loves the food (they did not deserve to remember their name there) were so annoying that they were crazy. When he ever talked about something scientific or about food. Dad Mollys did not show enough excitement about her daughter's disappearance. The police officer and Molly's father said the same thing four times. it was horrible. Everything has been repeated to much. Beatrice should have had something wrong with her because she was so bad. I just lost a moment in my life watching this movie!
