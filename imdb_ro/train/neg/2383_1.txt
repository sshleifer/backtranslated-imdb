This is a candidate for the most fun cinematic experience in my life. Cool title, excellent director (I saw "To Die For" and "Cowboy Drugs" before that), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you be wrong? Well, this is a question that blew into my temples for a few hours after I looked at this turkey. Disjoint and unhappy in an attempt to be out of control, this is a dead zone in a movie that should be avoided at all costs. His critical lack was well worth it. Here's one of those rare movies that does not contain a single redeeming quality. Zero from ****.
