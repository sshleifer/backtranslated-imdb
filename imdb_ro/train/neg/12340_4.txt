"Transylvania 6-5000" is a horror parody of the mid-1980s, insignificant, but occasionally amusing and charming, with some well-known names in the cast and a handful of real occasions to chicote in the script. Two bosom journalists of a gossip tabloid newspaper are sent, very much against their will, in Transylvania to make a story about the supposed return of crazy Frankenstein scientist. There are some small tricks and adorable details to discover left and right in the film, such as a small guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are used to put cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The nourishing film, however, is not as successful as it could and should, with jokes and parody that are too long. Roger Corman's production "Transylvania Twist," which came out four years later, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film parodies, in particular, the classic classical landmarks in the early 1930s, so you have to be sure you've seen them if you want to understand all the small gossip and references. There is a fairly original tendency to indicate that the Frankenstein character behaves only as a bad bad scientist when entering his lab. He also pointed out that he is in fact more of a type of father-in-law Damien, who only deals with the situation of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, a weird guy who interprets Kramer in Seinfeld, plays the role of a psychotic butler who appears and disappears in the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure John Pattinson's character from Mr. Deeds was inspired by Richards's role here.
