I like Chris Rock, but I feel he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​resuming Heaven Can Wait is good, but the directors have gone too far behind the turkey's plot. When Eddie Murphy remodeled Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he made them all again - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just cold remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same, it could have been a better movie. Some laughs come when he's doing his routine - so he could have made a concert movie. It would also have been more fun if the white man whose body lived was a truck driver or a hillbilly. So why does Hollywood continue to make such junk? Because people are going to see her - because I like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent screenplay and give us better movies! Do not remodel the movies that were not so good first!
