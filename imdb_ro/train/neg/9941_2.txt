I really want to say. This will not help the Australian film industry to make this type of movie worthless. Okay, if you're stoner and you have nothing better to do then maybe. I think filmmakers here should try to show the rest of the world who are the talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for him. Come on, this movie is just sticky.
