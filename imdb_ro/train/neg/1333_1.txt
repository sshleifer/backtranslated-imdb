I was completely disappointed with this movie. I've read some of the other reviews here and I've waited a lot longer. I was expecting a drama with a more intense character development. But that's never happening in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some commentators here would have to believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 moves in the movie. I would evaluate my performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Action: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I deleted the movie from the DVR to 70 minutes. in the movie. Movies much better than there ...
