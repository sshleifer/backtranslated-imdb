This short comedy Hal Roach, a tough winter, is ninety-nine in "Our Gang / Little Rascals," the series and the eleventh talk. In principle, a showcase for the black comedy Stepin Fetchit, which receives a special bill here, we see him going in his boat where the gang comes out. Farina takes a letter of love from the post office for him and tells Stepin to read it because she can not read it during the day when she goes to NIGHT school. It happens to be from his Tennesse girlfriend, so Farina must have eats stuffed with cotton because she's too hot to hear! In another room, Weezer relays instructions for Mary Ann to make the caramels from the radio, but because he continues to work back and forth to the kitchen, he loses the Segue Crainic lady to the rice pudding and Spanish Tamale tangled Mary Ann, with add-ons of Tabasco and Lux! After the preparation is completed, Jackie and the rest of the bandage help with the awful taste but very sticky substance that everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. As he tries to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various ducts and electrical sockets that combine the functions of variable devices such as a vacuum cleaner phone, a vacuum ringer, and a refrigerator that plays music! The end. What we have just described is the telling nature of this brief "Our Gang," which served as a pilot for a potential short film series Stepin Fetchit. It's as good as it did not happen as the lazy characterization of Negro Fetchit was funny only in small doses and would be very offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for some laughs, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were too good for me. So, in summary, a loud winter is a curious one worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
