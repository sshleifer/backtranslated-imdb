I thought before starting with these movies that it could be a good one, but when I started with it I found it terrible. They said the film was made in Afghanistan, but I think 95% of the film is shot in India. you can see cars manufactured in India. you can see lars drinking beetles (an Indian water brand), Hindi written on the way, you can also see temples in Afghanistan * its very funny hahah * and many other things that proves its not shot in Afghanistan. I think you should not waste your time watching this movie .. loss of pure time .. I would recommend doing something else instead of watching this movie or it may be the heart of the better idea but do not look at this loss of time
