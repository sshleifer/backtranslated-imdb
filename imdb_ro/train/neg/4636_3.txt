The "Confidential" side had the role of preventing the popular appearance of the magazine with the same name, while the racquet of the labor force was linked to the titled Congress of the day. However, despite the A movie in the B class and some good scenario ideas, the film takes place for 73 minutes. It's a production of cheap jacks to the end. What is needed to compensate for the weaknesses of production is an imagination, especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight shots, for example, would have helped lower the succession of terrible studios. An elegant rider, like Anthony Mann, could have done something with the thick ear material, but Salkow treats him as another day's payday. It's a pity that the typical Brian Keith's typical style does not work here, but just as wooden and lethargic, while the figure of worship, Elisha Cook Jr., goes over the top like a wild-eyed drone. Obviously, Salkow is not the director of an actor. But, you have to give it to that small number of kisses, Beverly Garland, who treats her role with a characteristic and dedication wizard. Too bad he was not responsible. My advice ... skip it, if you're not in ridiculous girls, who do nothing but whiskeys in the typical style of the 50 jackets.
