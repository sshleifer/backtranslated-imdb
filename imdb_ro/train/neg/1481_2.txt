Did they use the whole budget to pay for porn stars or what? The sound effects, background music and editing in general was so bad that you thought about 12 years would be the movie. Most of the act was good considering the scenario ... "the innocent virgin" played her role very well. <br /> <br /> Mutants look cool and this could be a cool movie with the right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately for all involved, that's not the case. The left tower was made better than this movie, and those guys do not even have the money! Okay, I did not rent the movie!
