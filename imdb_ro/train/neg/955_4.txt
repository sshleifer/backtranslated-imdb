I do not think any player in the history of Hollywood has lasted as long as David Niven gave the most of the weak movies he had to carry because of his incredible charm. He could act, he got an Oscar for him, but most of the material he made was as easy as a layer of two-layer paper. Happy Go Lovely is a case in this regard. It's a musical and, for the most part, you'll remember the dance of Vera-Ellen. You will remember that I am in Scot's costume while the film is in Edinburgh during the festival. But if you can remember a single song, you need a photographic memory. The land is light. Vera-Ellen is the American leader in a musical that seems to take the chance to get out of town in Edinburgh. It starts in chorus and runs late one day. He has a lift from the driver of a millionaire congratulations king. Everyone now assumes that it is the main tightening of the millionaire. The doors open, as they have not been opened before. The millionaire is David Niven and he goes with him and the various situations that are generated by mistake. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical. Finally, however, Happy Go Lovely is a light and harmless fluff that David Niven has done so much and got tired.
