Absolutely messy slasher film does not have a quality of redemption. She has the Angela Camp Counselor (Pamela Anderson..wrong as a killer, her quips when she loses people are not even funny) on warpath killing teens who act at least a little naughty or resist her plea for good behavior. He performs a wide range of boring, clich√© criminals, such as a child blowjob, looking for Freddy's glove, a child who gets a chain, a girl who's in the mouth,) one that's fried , etc. It does not have an original idea to offer and it's just a waste of time. That's if you do not want to see Valerie Hartmen (who plays brother Ally) tits. Most of the violence appears outside the screen, so even that will not satisfy.
