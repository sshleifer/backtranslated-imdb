This movie is hard to do, not great. Some memorable scenes and Norman Jean's unlucky mistruction choice with a real actress. Jane Russell works for her, the younger woman and / or Marilyn's actress. We can only ask why this is considered to be one of the most important moments of the blade career. 3/10
