Seeing "Der Himmel über Berlin" as a teenager at the end of the 80's was a profound experience for me - "that's how movies could be." Together with "Paris, Texas" and "By the End of the World" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to Wim Wenders genius. Unfortunately, a steady decrease in the quality of his work with the Million Dollar and Land of Plenty hotels hit a weak point. The captivating images or music disappeared. Do not search or display an excellent understanding. All that remains is the thin political characters and declarations that clash with clichés and sincerously commit suicide on the intelligence of a mature audience. Has he managed to dry well? Whatever the reason, it is time for Mr Wenders to step up or stop altogether.
