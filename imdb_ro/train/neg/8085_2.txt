Oh, hilarity! A joy! Another movie that is so bad is good! Or, that's what I thought. In reality, he loses his "so bad" phase and unfortunately goes directly to "he could have been so bad, but he cheated and made him bad." /> For a start road too long. You cut for half an hour, and it may have been more tempting. Then put into such ridiculous plots as "the man who sabotage the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the stored food and he will be rich if the mission fails!". !. or the plotter with the "talking bomb" last seen in Dark Star. Guess what ... as in Dark Star, the bomb has a faulty operation ..... hmmmm. Add a note "We can not get out of a kindergarten" and you have a short solar crisis. <br /> <br /> The easy resumption will take the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we have called him in this film), whose only purpose in the film is to lead a child around the desert and to call the baby's father to come up with him ... in the end. Between driving and telephoning, Jack releases unnecessary swallowing and puddles and heaps a lot, but he does little to the story, as it is. In short, he is the best shot of the movie. My prize for "The most ironic line delivered face to face" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when he meets his eldest son for the first time, comments his son looks a bit "in shape" while he himself stands there with his throat stuck over his bust and urgently needed by a Cork Corker Kirk. Also funny is the bad guy who has a bright white hairstyle that made me think of Andy Warhol for some reason. Apart from these hilarios, this film is not recommended. The end is a copy from (but far less than) the end sequence since 2001. Tips for enjoying this movie more if you are stupid enough to watch it, as we did: <br / > <br /> <br /> 1. Every time the bomb speaks, imagine it's called Tarquin. 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and is about to talk, it prevents him recite a line on the Planet of Monkeys such as "Get your dirty paws off me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever female leadership is in a stressful search (this is most of the time) continues to be scared to hope that she has an aneurysm and will soon die. Throughout the endless scenes, "the ship broke again", he continues to say that technicians will establish a Scotty as "You can not change the laws of physics!" or other such shit. Otherwise, do what is necessary to bring you through it. I woke up halfway and woke up to realize that I did not miss anything, nor did I have a plot (no matter how ridiculous it is). So do not worry about tuning for a few, you will not lose anything.
