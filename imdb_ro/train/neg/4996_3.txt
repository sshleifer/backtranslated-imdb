I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, it has become a career, or I should say, "badly simple". This is just another example of obsolete humor. It might have been fun in 1940, but not now ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked it once he started to move from the boy's look and the busy voice of Busby Berkeley's music to where he matures and he calls him too. Jimmy MacDonald was good, but the rest of the cast just played silly characters, worst being Raymond Walburn, head of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but shout all the time. It was brutal to hear and it was a big disadvantage for the movie.
