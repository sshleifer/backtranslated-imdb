... and it's this movie. I imagine that if there really is a life of negative death, the cursed souls are linked to a rather inconvenient couch and forced to watch this film on a continuous loop for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen near "Manos, the hands of fate" ... and I've seen many bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> This is just a brutish movie B, the bad movie at the best (or is it the worst?) The thing I really did not like about this movie is the dutiful duo they threw in the comedy relief . Now, a relief of comedies is a good thing, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two dead rather than the "heroes" of this film, who are actually in it for less than them! To be fair, Crown International has really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and making a bad job editing. But honestly, it was probably a bad movie, so Crown could not have done so much to hurt her. <br /> <br /> This really has to be in the bottom 100 list. I would not want this on the worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my kind of campy B. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my star rating.
