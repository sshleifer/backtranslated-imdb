I've heard many stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took the opportunity when I saw it at a cheap price at Ebay last month. I looked at her and I only have a few comments about it: 1) Terrible story-line, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad battle scenes ... I have never seen any worse film in my life, far away!! When the story is bad, at least make some more interesting fights. But so bad ridicule is made ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, look beautiful in this movie. That's about it ...
