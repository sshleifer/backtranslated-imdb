The actor is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are beautiful, so if you look for a good soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you waste your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the eponymous leadership, is often a mystery. She could have told the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her boyfriend would have been spared in prison for a rape she had not done. Did she protect her father, who left half when he spurred a malicious process? She protected herself, with her sudden reputation of worry, when so far only her art seemed to matter? During the process, this woman with strong will returns to our eyes. Instead, her lover, who begins as a stupid narcissist, becomes a disinterested hero during the process. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices for love. Naturally, since no good deeds must remain unpunished, we are told that they never see it again.
