Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never forget them. Let me tell you about my experience ... The only reason I watched this movie was that my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see Happy Feet. I have never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than ... the movie? Anyway, we did not expect to be fine ... we just went in for laughing at her. Cool with me ... I have a problem with ruining the film for other people in the theater, but since there were just other couples talking and doing, it does not matter. After 15 minutes, two other people let themselves sneak into Borat, a movie that I would have gladly saw again over this. The movie was not scary and not stupid, so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not terrible that "Baby Genuises" was terrible, it was terrible that ... it was not fun at all. Avoid. Now I'm not an expert, but it seems that the horror industry problem these days is that you can have a horror PG-13 that is boring and not scary, or you can have a R that's too bloody or too disgusting for people. You want a PG-13 horror to drink, but is it funny? See "The Grudge". Avoid this movie as a plague ... because it may literally lead you to death. 0/10
