Seeing that I do not like to read long essays hoping to find a point and to be disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. Pretty terrible. And, not surprisingly, for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought to agree with him, seeing them as he gave the film the rank he deserves, but he was sadly rebuked reading what he said. I'm rather ashamed to be in the same place as someone who commented that the movie "certainly has not beautiful women." Let me be the first to say: "Wow, that was definitely a serious deep review there. My mind can hardly understand philosophical ideas about this movie." Seriously, however, the lack of "beautiful females" should not be considered as essential to a movie. If you are quite desperate for "beautiful women," you should really watch other types of movies that do not necessarily fall into the science fiction category.
