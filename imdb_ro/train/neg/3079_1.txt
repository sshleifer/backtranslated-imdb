My favorite quote from Crow was, when the car was off the cliff, "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" It had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was serious there to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it was not for the Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
