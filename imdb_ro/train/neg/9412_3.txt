This movie was filmed as part of the 2007 Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no expectation from the movie that someone else would choose it for me. In fact, I like movies that take time to develop, movies that allow the character to unfold and allow the story to flow. Stilliness is good. But this movie was simply slow. The credit should be addressed to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them, as two completely different people, useless, indeed, in a very strange way. There were moments and sadness, when we found out more about them. I also liked the setting and the way he was shot. It was claustrofob and monochrome and added the intimacy of the movie and strengthens the characters' strange. I just do not understand the end. What was the purpose of all?
