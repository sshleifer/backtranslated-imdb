This movie is so bad that it makes me want to vomit. Made bad, a free laughing area. Why in God's name, you praise a movie, to some extent, is a doll (and damn funny about it) as is? The sets are ridiculous, the effects so bad that they are not even ridiculous, and acting farcical. It's a complete mystery of why you could even think of this trash. National Lampoon once made the House of Animals, which people still consider hilarious. Now they have been relegated to make television movies like this piece of ****. Name your expletive and it could be used accurately to describe this movie.
