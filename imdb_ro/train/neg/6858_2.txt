John Huston Wise Blood's screening was a more terrible distortion of Flannery O'Connor's book than I would have imagined. From the terrific acting performances (and not, "Oh, that was done intentionally, just do not)" to the musical score better suited to an episode in Rockford Files, this movie was revolting. I looked at it without any hurt at first and in fact I waited for a pleasant experience. But the misinterpretation of the southern characters, from the ridiculous southern route to the way their faith was portrayed, was unforgivable. Even to the end of his life, who was completely devoid of any sense of character, he did not succeed in all the places where O'Connor's book shone and resonated. Actors portraying "southern policemen" could also eat hot dogs off the street in New York and quote the godfather. One of the best performances was the live and dead interpretation of Ned Beatty by Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears the Moat preaching the Church of Christ without Christ and sees signs of dollar and business opportunities. O'Connor's most powerful book is best known for being a gruesome, underground religious one that slips the seemingly lifeless body of the "Faith." Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as I and most of her fans understand, if I were so bold to say that. While I admit that I do not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her deeds to want to remain a fan. If I saw Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston would have done, I would have tossed it into the garbage. For Flannery and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting ... which will take some time.
