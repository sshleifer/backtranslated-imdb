I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The biggest redemption factor to hold the DVD is the short movie in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Do not misunderstand, I'm a horror girl. but I want a flesh behind the story, not to say that I prefer people's evil to happen, not to be deceived to look, as always, clips of animal tusks. The actions of brutality interrupt silence and long pain. If I were forced to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to my mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Too bad, boring, useless, and an uncomfortable watch.
