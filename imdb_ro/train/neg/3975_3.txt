She watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typically Mary Kate & Ashley fare with more kisses. It seems to me that the girls get tired enough of these things and it will be interesting what happens to them if they decide to break up and go there. In this episode of their adventures, they are trainees in Rome for a fashion designer who even puts them in the mailroom to find out what is hard to do (I suppose ...). Besides typical flirting with boys, there is nothing else but the Rome scenario, up to about Â¾ in the movie, when the reasons for being fired, then re-empowered, then fired again, then hired again. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world and show up in their interpretation. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if one exists). Even my children did not seem to take care of this boring "adventure" in make-believe. Let's see that they probably have only a few years to their legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
