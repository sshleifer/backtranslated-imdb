Wow, I love and respect a lot of everything David Lynch did. However, this film is similar to an attempt by the first director to make a pseudo-art film. <br /> <br /> To give you some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual director, however he has little visual artistic content (bare walls , "upside-down" with the ceiling in the background) 2. David Lynch usually prides himself proudly on the sound, but in this case you can even hear the noise of your camcorder. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to swallow the idea that it has something to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke from David to force fans to search on his website (for hours) just to find this thing. I hope so, because at least this idea is fun.
