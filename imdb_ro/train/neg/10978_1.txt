Usually, when a movie gets one vote, it's because someone likes to dislike it and is disturbed that it does not have a lower rating and so decides to draw it as much as it can, only give him a low rating. This is not the case here. Bonesetter is a perfect example of 0/10 film. He does nothing right and does not have the chance to do this because he is not really trying to do anything. There are components of a bad type of D & D novel that are not together and a total lack of any kind of action. It is clear that nobody was involved in this project and did not give it any serious effort, because even hard work for the people without problems would mean more. A really terrible movie.
