This could have been Gone With The Wind's homosexual counterpart, given its epic length, but instead is pleased to be a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happens. Characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in the story (actually there is no story) than looking for each other and kissing. It is a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition, like almost no dialogue, is completely wasted in a movie, rather than making no effort to examine the psychology of its characters with a certain dignity and to achieve true emotional resonance. In addition, it is claimed to be an "artistic" film by using the worst naive clich√©s of cinematic snobbery. But anyway, if someone can identify with her cumbersome banality, I think it's good.
