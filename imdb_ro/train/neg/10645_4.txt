I've never seen a movie from Tarzan, so when I saw it, I thought I'd make a shot. Unfortunately, I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and was somewhat overweight. Not as I imagined that Tarzan would look like. And if I had not missed myself while making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave a traditional cry. He also missed Tarzan swing through the trees - jump from the vine to the vine. Well, so much for the expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - Cheet Monkey was there. He was a guy guy out there. They were bad guys and guys and a love story ... very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad, you do not understand, but it's not as good. Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
