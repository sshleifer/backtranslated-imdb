This movie is just blades. A total loss of time and money. Banknotes are predictable, the characters are so clich√© and the way they talk about RPG players is not funny as well. The problem is that writers do not know how an RPG game works and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are plenty of losers playing RPGs, such as friction delays and total spoofing. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story does not make any sense. Who cares about how long a game is played? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors have not even tried to know what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I was ashamed to look at this lame film.
