I went to see this movie with pretty low expectations, imagining it was a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not so. I could barely stand on the movie without wanting to go. I went with the two children (ages 10 and 13) and even asked: "How much more?" After lived to the end, I wondered who would approve this scenario. Even trustworthy Fred Willard failed to save the pitiful dialogue, the state jokes, and the trivial story. I would suggest that someone who wrote and directed this movie (I use the free term) should take an online screensaver class or drop out of the local community college for a movie class. At least, there are many books on directing, screen writing, and film production that would teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue, and rhythm.
