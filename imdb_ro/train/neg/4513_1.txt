Even though the book was not exactly accurate to the real situation she described, she still had a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that someone who has been involved in making this film has ever been to Japan because it did not feel Japanese in the slightest. Almost everything was terrible. I will admit that the actors were generally good enough, but they could not have the chance to save him. Before I started the film, I was surprised that only ten people were in the cinema on a Friday night shortly after the movie was opened in Japan. In 30 minutes I was amazed that they were left. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize it. The whole movie has moaned me and laughs at my Japanese friend. Everyone I saw from that cinema had a look of confusion and disappointment on their face. <br /> <br /> For the producers of this film, you owe me two hours.
