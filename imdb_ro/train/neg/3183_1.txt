Sergio Leone is spinning in his grave ... If there was a movie that collides on human life, it's one. The main character of the "lone wolf bravado" is inanimate and blades, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an 8-degree education. Anyone who has this idea should be the whip of horses. The only reason I spent time trashing is that there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should sue not for its crap, but because it is now immortalized as nonsense by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does shit that will not offend anyone but cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
