This was amongst STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of anti-nuke films of the 1980s. The idea that a child and a basketball star could "change the world" is far removed, given the "children's peace movements" and "protests celebrity "have existed and are. But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament because some children belonging to the apparatus have learned a "silent protest" in the West is absurd. What ended with the Cold War? America is tough, I dare say the position of "Reaganesque" and the internal failures of socialism. There have been no marathon, "die-ins", or "Amazing Grace & Chuck," "Miracle Mile," or "Testament."
