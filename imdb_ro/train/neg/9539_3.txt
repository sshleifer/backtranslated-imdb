A bunch of kids have created a theater to have a horror film marathon. However, as they spend the night, they kill someone one by one. Who is ... and why? I saw this in a way of theater in 1991. I look forward to this - but boys! It did not work at all. The premise is a good one, they have a very appealing cast and some professionals like Dee Wallace Stone aboard ... but it does not work. The story does not make any sense at half-way (this could be because of a huge editing before the release of the movie), the killing is relatively bloodless (like a R rating beyond me), and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid. It's really too bad - this movie has potential. With a better script, this could have been a great horror movie. As it happens, it's more forgotten, and the distribution itself seems to be embarrassed by it (I hear Stone does not talk about it). I give it 3 and that's just for distribution.
