I've seen the movie this past weekend, I'm upset and disappointed with it. In fact, the film tells you that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring everyone with them from the old country and invade and take over what the Americans have done. Which is a very wrong way to look at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. This is the main thing. Another thing, general writing, direction and filming are at the level of amateurs in the village. The actors did pretty well, but it was not their job to save that pile of nonsense. Some jokes were fun, but most were bad and cheesy. I can not wait to get out of the theater, I want my money back.
