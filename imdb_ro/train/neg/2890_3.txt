The past lies on a detoxicant when he reconnects with his sick brother and a former girlfriend after hoping it was his last moment in detox. "The Dramas of Life", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (even writing has no bite or spirit). The cast is made up of attractive actors who shake each other, and music and photography are lugubrious (some visual effects are ridiculous, indie-clique touches that damn budget). Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman and I'm not sure, but I think this could be a distinct reason why this image of two men, alienated brothers is coming, seems to live. It is an attempt to enter into a male relationship, but careful and sterile presentation is a cheap one. No one has the heart in this, living, breathing or bleeding this material. The "perfect son" is quickly circulated by too many cooks in the kitchen.
