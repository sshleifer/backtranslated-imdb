Cheap and manipulator. This movie has no heart. It also has a bad dialogue, unbelievable characters and an absurd or rather non-existent story. He just heels from evil to worse in a cynical effort to wipe out a kind of emotion from a hysterical, unimportant and unimaginable-fest! And HEDGEHOG !!!! How many cheap pictures can a movie make? The archaeologist, by the way, gave the most convincing and visible performance in this cringe-athon of ninety minutes. If you thought you were watching this movie, do not do that. I'm sorry, but I can not find a single redemption facility for this movie. You're writing a big, greasy ZERO with me. Strictly for the humming sub-Dogma. Yawneroony! However, if you liked Dance in the Dark ... <br /> <br />
