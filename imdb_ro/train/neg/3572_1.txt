The wonderful "Z" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obvious LIGHT in this movie. Again, it was in the 80's and I must tell you that Harold Robbin's work has been eclipsed by clever writers. Jacqueline Susann has kidnapped him (hates the way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work has captured many women and, of course, Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom in the early 1980s and then Jackie Collins, who made women more strong and equal to men in all sorts of her books, all the more. That's why this work smells. Harold Robbin's activity in the 1980s did not take place with the public. Zadora's pie acting in one of Robbin's activities was like kerosene throwing on fire. Oooooh ... this was awful to look at then and even after another 20 years, it seems even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and we were just shot when we did that. It would be hard for Pia to redeem himself as an actress (though John Waters who cast her in Hairspray was a spark) though she has a pleasant voice. Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. Perhaps you are the biggest story to come back yet. I hope she would burn this movie for you if you do.
