Being a fan of Elvis, I do not understand how that could have been done. It's by far the worst Elvis movie ever related, totally unpleasant, stupid, and many mistakes about the King. Come on, Elvis's tomb in a public park? A mention of the suspicious minds of 1958 ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try to do everything possible, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an impersonator), Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing Elvis sucks.Overall youngster is fun and becomes more boring after minute. If you want to see a very cheap, insan but absolutely funny film about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
