Well, I rented this movie and found out that it was a shit. It's about that family with the stepfather and the same stupid battles in the family, then the cold son comes with his bad room and likes to take a picture of the damaged building, weird things and strange movie and then ask his father to take it to a side trip and simply agrees, etc. etc .. They go to that city that nobody knows there is (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie is over and you still do not understand what this movie is! I have seen many mystery movies, but that was the worst, sincerely lacking description and I do not want to see it.
