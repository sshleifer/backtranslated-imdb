I'm a fan of the show and I read all 7 books. I wanted to see this just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should follow this are those who have already read the series and are curious. It's bad enough and it will disable you reading them. Do not be bad, but Lucy is so ugly that it destroys the movie. Was she the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure the castors in the film were jealous of teeth. He had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame. The film loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR or even Harry Potter. One thing they did good! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with dyed faces (castor, wolf) look stupid, Aslan was very well done because he was not just a human actor walking around. (I think they would like the old horse custome? 2 people inside?), I would also be curious what kids think about this movie. Maybe they would like it? But, as for adults, the bet bet is not accustomed, even if a CS fan.
