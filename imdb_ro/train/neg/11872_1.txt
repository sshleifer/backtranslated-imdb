The only way in which a family drama is about whether parents explain everything wrong with their message. SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year, and then kill her because they ate the food after they killed their mother and at first pontificated about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame the bears and the deer for "maneuvering," eating while not taking responsibility for using appropriate chains or fences or even learning to shoot instead of killing the animals twice and letting them stop.
