I rarely write comments for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential spectators that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater), and I have had great expectations for it because I found it listed on many sites "10 Best Kung Fu Movies / Martial Arts". (Now I am convinced that the 10 best lists are all cut and glued jobs). First, there is no action in the movie. Most of the film consists of talking about the plot, which is an amazing fact because it is the best thin. And the action itself was impressive in 1978, but it is accustomed to current standards. A special warning for Netflix users: The DVDs they carry are terrible; the picture is terrible and not even improved with 16: 9.
