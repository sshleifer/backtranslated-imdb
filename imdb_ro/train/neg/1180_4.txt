Notorious for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), darkness is the biggest thing it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked, rather than actually seen when you can not get back the "legend" of substance. The film has played in Los Angeles several times recently and is available on video at home, so the veil is slowly lifted. While there is still plenty to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them than to awaken real passion. Except for a free and prolonged XXX scene, between a pair of horses ("Nature Documentary" someone?), There is almost an hour of the arranged marriage melody. Once sex and nudity begins, it's a nonstop sequence involving masturbation, a retrospective of a supposed "confrontation with beauty and beast," and an empty woman running around the manor (no one, not even a presumptive protective aunt, seems to be even think of putting some clothes on it!). In the case of the video, I think you can get through the banality quickly, but it's not worth the effort. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial, such as Bertolucci's The DREAMS. Try to find a "moral" or "symbolic" carnal, I doubt it is worthy of someone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie easier, the notoriety of something "forbidden" has been lifted. And this beast was tainted.
