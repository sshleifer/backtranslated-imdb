Unlike "Buckaroo Banzai's Adventures" or "Big Trouble in Little China," or "Conan the Barbarian," which are terrible movies that have a certain state of coolness and humor of self-deprecation that transforms them into worship sensations, simply bad. The premise itself is not inaccessible and there are some funny moments. But here Eddy Murphy's "flipping attitude" deflates any sense of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are lightened rather than daring to force themselves. Without the feeling that something is at stake or that the characters are experiencing a real danger, why should we care? br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - Eddy Murphy's big fans who can not help themselves <br /> <br /> - I can not think anyone else <br /> <br /> will give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
