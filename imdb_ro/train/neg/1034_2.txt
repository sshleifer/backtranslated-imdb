After Scooby-Doo's success, where are you, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character who has destroyed Scooby-Doo's success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. Scrappy-Doo made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and children together. Scrappy was a stupid, brave puppy who always seemed ready to defeat someone. Scooby and Shaggy scared the bastard and tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need a few annoying grandchildren. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they would have to either kill or never think about Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids would prefer it!
