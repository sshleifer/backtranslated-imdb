Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. Low production figures, terrible story idea, stupid scenario, lack of action ... nor can they come up with a descriptive adjective for how poor Joan River Direction is. I know there's a special place in Hell for those who funded this movie; prolly just below the level reserved for genocide maniacs killing children. <br /> <br /> This movie is a job. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinite) = rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at any cost. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
