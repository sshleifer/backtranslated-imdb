Media viewers looking for a sense of internal coherence in a movie should probably give it a pass. It generates the same feeling as if viewed in a strange range of individual images that seem to have a relationship with each other, but they never coalesce into a totality. While this isolation approach to creating a kind of cinematic assemblage can appeal to a few students or critics in English of contemporary film, it is irritating and condescending to us, ordinary people, who have just fallen from the haywagon. A clear evidence of accessibility may be the distinguishing mark of the authors like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me it happens when Andy Warhol gets warm. The only ransoming feature I find is in the values ​​of production, and they do not want to cut everything through them. This is one of those productions that you look and listen to and look forward to and in vain for the intelligent development of an idea or thought to sustain all outstanding and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic credits start unexpectedly to roll, just as your interest begins to interfere. I give the same yawn and I read what I think there are a lot of detailed knowledge and commentaries about this movie that never really do anything to understand. Ideas and images without a particular external context are not my idea of ​​fun. Call me a philistine roaming on the streets of Hong Kong, looking for a suey chop bowl.
