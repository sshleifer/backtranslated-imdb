This movie was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that get away with me: 1. The forests were more like hills in Los Angeles, with some trees and brushes. It's not scary. Flash news, if you shoot in the South California area, the big bear is only one hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I've ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was non-original, clich√© or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (blades), the clown name is the "clown killer" (blades). What does a clown do in a forest? Was that the only mask they found? 3. The last, certainly the smallest, was the act. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A horn of virtual joy of evil lines and a faint action. The worst part was when a return to this fatal stranger who was naked for a photo appeared at random. It's a very long scene and I think it should be sexy, but it was NOT. Also, this was one of the few pleasant parts of the movie for me, it was this instrument that should be "athletic". For example, when he gets bored in the film, he takes some rocks and starts to crawl with them. Then, later, he should be running for the clown, and it is immediately clear with the very "girl as" running, that he is far from athletic. Oh and the girl who played Kat, the good Lord stopped singing. The song you sang for credits makes me want to kill myself. If for some reason you see this movie, I would recommend at least to watch the special features. The band of sticks who made this film talk about it as if it were this truly original story. In fact, one of the girls actually says she left some of her friends to read the script, and none of them could predict the end. Apparently, she rests with special children.
