If you made a genre at the end of the 80's, you basically had a 50/50 chance, whether it was under water or in a prison (unfortunately, I have never received a prison movie under water) . Closed to the murder of Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), is dying alongside Frankie's brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems as a dishonest government agent (and stoolie mob) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also leads) uses prison as a test ground for a new superintendent. This is the only film Saxon has had in his career. For a guy who worked with tons of directors, it seems that the only ones he took the advice was the cheapest in Italy. Sure, it's a low budget, but that can not excuse season, gales, or clumsy exposure in the first 15 minutes. Saxon made her grow up slightly and worked in a hilarious nude scene (our leadership was asleep during a prison riot just to fantasize about a woman scientist). Cole, who looks like a more robust Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as Stoic lead, and Franciosa - who has a very bad carpet - offers him everything as a clich√© mob mob. The end takes place at Marty McKee's favorite location, Canyon Bronson. Retromedia released this DVD movie as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
