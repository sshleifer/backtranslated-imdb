It's hard to believe that a "Jet Li" packed in "action" might be so boring, but it was transcendent garbage. The land is an amalgam of other Hong Kong movies. The action of martial arts is a special effect and does not have human talent. It's a story about a group of super-human soldiers to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their number (Li) holding an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian. Rescued criminals reappeared with Austin Powers quality plot to take over the world, and Li gives new life to save the world. The version I saw was reproached and that would have accentuated the joy of the thin chart and the 25-cent comic book. But I suspect that ninja-turtles coming at the age of eight would find this minor and empty.
