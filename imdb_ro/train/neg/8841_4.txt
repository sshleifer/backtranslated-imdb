Parasomnia has an interesting space, but the story is badly done without any tension or even a logical approach. The unconvincing piece, even Patrick Kilpatrick, has played important roles in films such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good), except for Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the big Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is little he does here). The main problem is that the actions of the characters do not make any sense. The story is pretty boring and predictable, with cheap computer effects mixed with some goral scenes, especially at the end of the year. This could have been a lot better, I'm not getting good reviews on the issue. It's just below the media.
