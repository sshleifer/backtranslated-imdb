This may be one of the most enjoyable movies in history unless you take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are blades, but it's so enjoyable. There are huge crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It's amazingly bad. And the end, which has been telegraphed throughout the movie, is great awesome. Predictable, but seeing the final battle will let you run into the chair. You do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to look and yes, she seems naked. Her daughter is not worth it, but she is attacked by the giant crabs. It's the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I like it. Like a movie, God, but for entertainment, I gave her a 7. I mentioned that they are giant crabs?
