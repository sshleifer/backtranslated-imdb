I tried to like this program; I did. I bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not get into this story because the two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to love themselves for one thing. I admit that there was a smart dialogue in shows, which was an essential part of the success of the TV program, and I appreciated much of that dialogue. Practically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy films of the 30's and 40's with men versus females. You have many arguments, accusations, screaming and screaming. Many people appreciate this kind of hit, but I hate it, so I never went to the Moonlighting band. Only Allyce Beasley, as an indefatigable aggressor, "Agnes," was fun. It's too bad he had some air time. The shepherd was beautiful on the eye and I think women would say the same for Willis, but too many arguments between the two finally stopped me.
