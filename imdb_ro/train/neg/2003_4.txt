For all his visual delights, the more Renaissance would have been better in living action. The animation is fantastic in the overall picture, yes, but the characters are cold and naked, just like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, maybe the movie world would not have been so lifeless. There is a lot to be admired here, but in the end I discovered that all I could do was admire. I did not really like the movie and clarify something I did not see before: visual elements may be the positive defining aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters there can be nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not get anything, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I like dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies we consider to be wonderful. But Blade Runner had a tragic character, and Dark City had a provocative arch. Renaissance has shadows and light, but there is nothing else. I would have liked to love this movie, but the poor story and the naked characters stood in the way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic is the fact that one of the most grim and lifeless films I've seen this year takes its title from the Renaissance.
