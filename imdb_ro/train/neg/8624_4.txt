The act was not great, the story was full of simplistic transformations and transparent characters. These are the repercussions of the struggle between the right-wing Flemish voters on the one hand and those in Morocco living in the Belgian town of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a Belgian story of the West Side Story or the modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming these were the director's questions). Still, some scenes could work as a kind of Ken Loach film set in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the extreme right wing party in Flamand Block and faces a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a movie about this situation, and this is unfortunately not a success. Still, it tells of a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. The few foreign watchers who are following should try to enjoy and realize that it is not the real important film but the social separation lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a country of 10 million people, in the year 2000 Dries Van Dongen
