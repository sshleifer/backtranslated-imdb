Well, during this thankful break, while we had the whole family, everyone decided to go to a movie and since the Fred clause was voted the majority, that's what we went and say. <br /> <br /> To start the movie had so many holes of plot was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a particular event happened were canceled. example; who the hell is trying to "shut down" the Santa clause? Is it a kind of corporation? A little explanation would have been great. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie threw you in terrible characters that did not give you any sympathy for your feelings or actions. example: the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the village of elves. are seen twice and then I'm a couple and I could worry less because that movie did not worry me. <br /> <br /> Third: Suppose it was a family movie? His rating was low on PG only. For a family movie there were several suggestive conversation articles. Do not bother me, but if I were a parent, I could see a problem. Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti seemed extremely bored of his role, but he was the only one who deserved to watch the film. Vaughn had some funny moments, but he played the same character he has for the last two movies. Brother boy. (nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other movies), so this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me just because someone had to make the effort to produce, film and release this movie. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would certainly pass this move, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental.
