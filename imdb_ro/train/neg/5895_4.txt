Miike is like Chabrol, alternating art with the hell, sometimes confusing the two? Does it fit the fifty / fifty rate that claims Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines, citing only the theft, the austerities and the cliches of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call's). Others here will strike most of them, though Saimin Ochiai (Hypnosis) can not for mad television teasing supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi has a zombie-like mom in the hand, a single missed call surprises me a little. Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in Audition's abusive story, and as Head of Dead or Alive, Aoki in the pan of overflowing drool and more, may be the most convincing evil character actor I've ever seen. So here's a cop.
