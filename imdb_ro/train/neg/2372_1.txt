Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closing at nightmare on Elm Street -series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay intentionally intended to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into a big and bad joke. This is not just the worst entry into the Elm Street saga; is also one of the most embarrassing horror films ever made and abusively offends fans of genre! The story is bad, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is dark, and? most ?? special and visual effects similar to those of a cartoon Tom & Jerry. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we have been petrified when a pitiful Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game character and put him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood, and apparently Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. Do you think he would mention this in one of his previous adventures, but right? In Springwood there is only a teenage survivor, and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this last tranche is so terrible is the completely illogical structure. John Doe-boy is introduced as the main character, but then suddenly dies and the intrigue continues to rotate on two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who spent five films that kill nothing but teenagers, is finally beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Kind of ruins like the whole essence, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series, but so far the worst records have at least a few redeeming elements. "Freddy's Dead", however, is simply indescribable and no one should lose his precious time watching him.
