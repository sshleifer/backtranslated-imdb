Yuck! And again I say ... GREAT! The original version of this film was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and who was purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and did not get out of the way to say it. And, he had a naked baby on a motorcycle. This version sees me as something that a producer bought his rights and then was abandoned by disinterest. It seems that a group of individuals have consciously decided to fit it in the nineties and have changed their ethnicity and genre just to be nice. The film does not refer to a burn that is about to commit suicide in a final act of defiance. It's a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. There was no reason why this film had been made just to upset me ...
