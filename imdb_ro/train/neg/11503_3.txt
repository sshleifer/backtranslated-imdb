Quentin Crisp once said that when things are too beautiful, someone is romantic. When things are shown imprudently, they are realistic. And when something is ironic, they're on the scene. Unfortunately, for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a "Ken Loach" Spanish film without capturing comedy and warmth among the characters, which raises Loach movies to be "depressing." Los Lunes al Sol, it's just that, just depressing. Things are unrealistic of gloom. The characters of the last moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point, and if the offending story is not enough, Aranoa launches the story with a gray and gray palette. The movies were ridiculously overrated at Goyas. A film that shows empathy for the weaker citizens of society, in this case the workers who work in the unemployed, do not automatically make a good film, even if I were the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This movie only succeeds in making me disinterested in their fate. In Spain, in the 21st century, unemployed do not live as beggars, and public transport ferries have decent toilets, and it's hard to get over a bar with so few players and such a joy of happiness that meets in it. Leon de Aranoa, obviously, has no idea about the working class in Spain and does not do it favorably. The pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watch a football game for free was copied directly from a movie that is much more "realistic" about the subject of the "Purely Belter" trap, which is more interesting, more humorous , yet sad.
