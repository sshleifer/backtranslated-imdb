A romantic and false view of unemployment from a "middle class" artist with a comfortable education ... It is clear that the director-writer has never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like adolescents, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live during the day, carrying jokes, boys boys. They never seek a job, almost never experience rejection or suffering, etc. Living a mass is like a summer school holiday ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare it with Ken Loach's contemporary masterpieces, etc.
