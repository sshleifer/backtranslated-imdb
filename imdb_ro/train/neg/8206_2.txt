With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this movie to be at least tolerable. It was not. After the first half hour, I saw the rest with the remote in my hand, so the fast ahead was ready. So sad, so standard, we know what will happen in every scene. You can even predict the word dialog for the word. This is one of those movies that make a scratch-head and say, "How has this movie ever been made?" In an effort to say something positive, I will add that there are some fun special effects. But overall, if you saw 5 Sci-Fi movies or if you are over 9, do yourself a favor and skip it.
