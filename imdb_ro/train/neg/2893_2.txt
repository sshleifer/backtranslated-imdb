What should that be? A remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What slow, terrible, boring film that damn-fucks about these people! Just painful to stay, I stopped him before it's over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; as I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his everyday life? We should not believe that deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler the chance to return to him? If they were such good friends, how did they break up? If Cheadle is so controlled, why is he still looking for the psychiatrist's advice on the street? We're never told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why that's stupid. Almost 8 out of 10 Average Points? I disagree. Not at all. Even top movies are lucky enough to get such a high average note, and this carp does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
