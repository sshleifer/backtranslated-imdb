Although in many respects I agree with the comments of other commentators. I think the idea and the plot are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented actor. As this person has ever been in a movie or television, I can not imagine. In my opinion, she would be better off as a bigger person than a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low talent involved in paying roles, ask the question ...... "Who knows"? I would love to see this re-realized film with a talent. I do not blame the writer for the failure of the movie that deserves to see him.
