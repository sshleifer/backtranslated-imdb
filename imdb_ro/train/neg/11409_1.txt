It really started the 80s tendency of disgusting violence, which behaves like a "horror movie". I was the target audience for this repellent trash and I was disgusted then like now. Oh, where are we going from? Let's see, the configuration: You can bring people back to live if a violent death has died. So the premise of weak laughter is an excuse to slaughter people in terrible ways, because, well, it is necessary to bring them back to life! This could have worked if she played over the top for the black laugh at Re-Animator or something like that. But no, it's just playing. There is a whole family frightened in a wagon that is hunted down, one of the few scenes, at least where their disappearance is deactivated. However, almost everything else is on the screen. There is actually a scene in which a young girl walking on foot is beaten and killed by the zombie inhabitants who shoot and smile with several rooms. Then there is a clogged image of her face, while movie makers love - and consume a lot of time - while photographing her photo while her beaten face is carved to a skull and rebuilt to look "normal" again. This was, of course, done by a frightening Jack Albertson as a mortician behind everyone. He likes to lead an ambulance / robbery by playing Tommy Dorcey's old songs, I think he should be cute. Finally, of course, even the sheriff is immortal and the doctor kindly asks his fingers. It is unclear why the sheriff is not outside the other townspeople who kiss children with joy and cut their faces, stick pins in the eyes of burn victims, etc. I wonder, I wonder, what people see a geek show to give him some sort of rating at all. It's not scary, breathing is ridiculous and, overall, it's pretty bad. It's not even enough to "see a bold" or to enjoy a level you can watch an evil film HG Lewis. It is just awful garbage for God, made for people who descend on this type of useless gore and made by people who get rid of salary. Sad that Albertson was really involved.
