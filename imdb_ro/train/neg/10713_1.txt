Come on, let's be real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or Knights Templar, as they are more often called, did not exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren looked only bored positively. And, moreover, if you wanted to have a true temple, why not just use the Knights of Christ, which still exists in Portugal. At least it ought to have taken into account history. The only quality of redemption I could find in this film was that artifacts seemed authentic enough to move to medieval or gothic pieces. The act was bad, the terrible story, the horrible action and the props were all right.
