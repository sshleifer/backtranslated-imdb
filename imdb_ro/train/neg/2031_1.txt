While William Shater can always make me smile in everything he does (and especially I love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down. > <br /> It has no information about the Millionaire, none of the Deal or No Deal flair. <br /> <br /> This show is about dancing and silly things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I just saw it just to check out. I saw it for over 45 minutes, then I had to stop it. The best part was William Shatner dancing on stage. He is a hoot! unfortunately, this show will not do that. That's one time
