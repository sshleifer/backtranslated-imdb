This is about the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've ever seen. I say quite a lot, because I also saw Soldier playing the bastard ... but what I heard is not Jason Scott Lee's film. That is, however. And if this is an indication of the quality of these films, I will not see each other again. Lee is practically acceptable as a martial artist ... as a lead, it's terrible. It struggles with unnamed random characters every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter could not figure out how to stretch the film to the minimum time required for a feature film. The bastard is the only person who even has a personality hint and, besides the fact that he is certainly crazy, he does not seem to be a villain at all. Most of the film is basically Lee pursuing evil in time ... or maybe it's reverse. I can not say for sure ... and I certainly could not look again to assure myself. The effects are not totally horrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to go and kill Hitler. In a way, the movie misplaces this interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for his good. Pacing is weak. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can not. It's just too formidable and useless. If I only had a time machine, I could go back and prevent this movie ever being made ... no, it does not matter. I only hope that few fragile minds are exposed to this possible. Listen to negative reviews. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee's fans and to no one else. If you're looking for a quality movie ... well, that's not it. That's for sure. 1/10
