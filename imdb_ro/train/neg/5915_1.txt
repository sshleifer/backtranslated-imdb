I've seen many, many movies in China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was "unknown pleasures." I saw the platform yesterday evening, and I thought the other two films of Jia Zhang Ke should be better. Tonight, I was disappointed again. I will not forget tomorrow night at "Xiao Wu", because I've just placed all three movies in the trash! Who gave this film, "Platform," ten out of ten, has to watch more cinema! The photo was very poor: it was very difficult to make a difference between some characters due to the lack of a close work. The story was so disjointed that I moved quickly to the end, out of pure frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day. These are the true masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious!
