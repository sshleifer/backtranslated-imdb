Decoy is one of independent productions made by newcomers records, but does not have the common flaws that sinks the most such films. Has a defined story has an appropriate action, the picture is very good, the hero and bad guy people are both formidable and background music is not overloaded. This is a new version of the DVD, so people will look here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where they come from all ten because there is no film to be so good, even if you are the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie I saw in a theater was destroyed by Warner J K Rawlings, a much-loved book and excellent Order of the Phoenix. Comparing Decoy PHOENIX, think PHOENIX (as did Warner) had no story certainly was not permitted any action by the director, the picture is terrible and the music score which seemed to be a sound was just a mess. I've rated Phoenix a "1" because the scale does not go down. DECO is 4 times better - in all respects. If you have the opportunity, give it a chance. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not exceeded scores "10" crazy here, could only enjoy the film on its own terms.
