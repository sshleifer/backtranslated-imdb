I would not say it's a bad movie. Unfortunately for me, I have the feeling that the more you know about the fencing, the worse it is simply because it becomes totally unrealistic. I have been fenced since I was 14 years old and this film describes her very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a backdrop), but most other actors - especially pupils - seem to lose.
