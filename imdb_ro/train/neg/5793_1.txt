It was so bad. Just like the short-dated TV series "Dirty Dozen" that he played at Ben Murphy and was made around the same time (also cheap in Yugoslavia). I was embarrassed for the members of this film - and especially for Telly Savalas. He was too old and fat waaaaaay for his role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer tracing parallel to Telly, the Greek in it and John Wayne in "The Berets Green," he calls it quite a lot. > <br /> Most commentators have highlighted some of the countless mourning monks that this celluloid murder has contained, so I will not repeat them here. But I add that I am amazed that no one has yet mentioned the wonderful ridiculous helmets that Savalas is wearing on their big, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I am also amazed that this film train has a rating of 4.7 at IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" even across the board. If you want a good example of motivating a franchise with death is really a bad idea (especially 20 years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fateful Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - avoid !!!!
