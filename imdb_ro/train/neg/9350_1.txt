This movie was terrible. The first half hour is much akin to ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first Clockwork! It is supposed to have been a tribute, as it appears on the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however "ripoff" is the most appropriate word. The movie felt as if it had been broken even from the classic Kubrick, just filmed through the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when he stops the massacre of Kubrick's work, the film is getting worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this film is just pushed into the throat. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless. Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was a real character development in this movie. I did not feel absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if someone could feel something for him, it would be me. Story of character development, dialogue and plot. The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie titled "16 Years of Alcohol," Alcoholism is not a filmmaker. See the first paragraph - was such a butcher of O Clockwork Orange can not get over it. A more appropriate title would have been "16 Years of Violence" or, Better, "A Banana with Clock". Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you ignore my advice and take it anyway, you drink. Trust me.
