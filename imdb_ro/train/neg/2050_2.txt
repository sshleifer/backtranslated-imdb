Not that "a film by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink under my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young producers to use digital video for their early projects, which is good and good to give these children the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on an expensive movie. But many of these young directors also understood the notion of filming the finished film so it would appear qualitatively more like celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. The unfiltered digital film only works for the "mockumentary" style, because it never shows anything but video. Here's the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie seems to be a view of a soap about a killer. It does not make sense to watch a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that Lommel is NOT a young director. He should know better. He should know that it is virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) On the video. For the love of God that the guy has been driving since the sixties! He may be the only director who has failed to improve his 40-year career in business. And lucky, he wrote the script! So, you can expect complicated actions that do not mean anything, unwarranted behavior, and at least a really pretentious plot that will leave you totally dissatisfied. Please please miss this movie. You'll thank me later.
