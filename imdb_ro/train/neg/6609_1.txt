I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I did not see any Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it might be good. This film seems to be an art attempt to commit suicide on behalf of the director and I think he was successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside this movie would risk sharing the same billing as he did for all the humiliation that this film is bound to bear with her. But do not just blame the director here, the cinema, which seems to repeat for the amateur home movie maker of the year's award. There is a dramatic score that hopes to take you to the next stage. The lightman, who must have held a cigarette in one hand and a pendulum bulb in the other, hoping that the flame that burns on the cigarette would add the necessary light in every scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are no news, otherwise everything could be forgiven here. The ensemble of Aag actors has been put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to re-making the most beloved film of all time in India, "Sholay." We must not forget that these actors were not forced to make this film, they are A-list and want to participate in something that, admit that they would have certainly had high expectations and eager expectations ??? So, ask the question, Amitabh for now (for now), the other actors think their performances really tried to improve the original? Amitabh Bachchan read the script and thought that people would remember the dialogue in this fraternal abomination of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course it did not, it was a demonstration to the public about how much money talks can make the actors go. I hope everyone involved is content with what is really a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film that only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they follow the original.
