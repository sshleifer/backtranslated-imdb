An interesting idea that involves an alternative dimension inside a hospital. He recalled - Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Hospital of the Kingdom" and old episodes of twilight. Atmospherically, the setting was great. There have also been some very "smart" moments, who always have that call to the melting of their heads. The story had a lot of vague references that made me think that all the oddities that followed - time slides / ghosts / a strange wand of wings and a pretty silly metal thing that hardly caught the gho-would have explained. And that was that they were dark squares. Based on viewing the movie, I have no explanation as to what is behind the events. However, some ambiguities are always expected / welcome in such films. The dark floors have led to new heights. I do not expect things wrapped in enough ribbon but I do not even have to feel "Huh? Is that? ... Did I give a dose? Maybe I hit the chapter by mistake jumping?" Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfied suspicion that "It was a dream," which is a shame because I was very much onboard and enjoying the movie until the last drum.
