"Succubus," the edited version of "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden", is a struggle to sit still, even at a time of 76 minutes; anything else in this great hole of dull and pretentious euro terror and I would have slipped into a coma. Jess Franco again offers a really scary piece of garbage for 60 years, which seems to have been made by a distributor and the crew from their head on Class A hallucinogenicity, because no second of this clutter made any sense. Apparently, this is one of the best of his 180 movies? it is hard to believe there is less effort there. The impassable plots deal with Franco's routine themes of sex, violence and lesbianism, and throw a bit of S & M for a good measure and yet still succeeds in keeping the mind boring. Can I leave him long enough to get back into the world of the terrible again? life is too short to be spent forgetting billiards like that.
