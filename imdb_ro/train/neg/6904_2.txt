It seems to me, like the recent graduate of the film school, that in these New Zealand movie times that reach new heights, the audience seems to think that every movie in New Zealand is great. Sione's wedding proves that this is dead wrong. It is completely overestimated and not funny, and away from the hilarious movie, other IMDb users have commented. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the black guy, but besides the jokes being recycled with shit I heard before. he wanted to see how the film would cover the Polynesian representation. It was a complete ball - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I did not feel that the characters had anything else to say about the Polynesian identity, even if it was in a clear manner. I was the most disappointed at the end of the film and the relationship of the character's relationship - Mikaele was the player who only walked around white women, comes easy to turn her way when "Dusky Maiden" comes to town, has an epiphany that can that he should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the last moment he rejects it and accepts his position as the Polynesian Playboy for the palace women. I did not understand why they did that. Overall, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see that she expected to have a good laugh, but she became very sad to pay to see at the cinema. The jokes are the best, the act, especially the friend of the Sefa, APPALLING, and I would sincerely be happy if I got my hand on one of the pirated copies of the movie to save me on the $ 15 ticket. /> <br /> I think the only good thing to come out of the film is that it is the second step (behind the number 2, of course, a movie far superior to this film) at the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope the Pacific filmmakers can learn from Sion's Wedding how not to reflect Polynesia and have something more significant and more sensitive to say. Even if it's comedic.
