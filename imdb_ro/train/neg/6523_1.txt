Please take a minute to read my entire analysis. I DO NOT BUY THE FILM - ONLY AVAILABLE CURRENT DVD VERSIONS. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie even two stars. I mean what could be a rank of only 1 in 10! How: an epic adaptation of Tolstoy's film "War and Peace" with precise historical battle scenes, the Red Army's kindness, and a highly faithful adaptation, scene for the novel would be difficult, but it would be worthwhile to stay on it seven hours - if that's what you've seen. The problem is you can not see this movie - anywhere I know. I'm trying to watch the RusCiCo DVD version - widely regarded as the best available version because it is written in the box and restores scenes that have been cut from other DVD versions. <br /> <br /> But it is one of the most serious movie footprints I've ever seen transferred to DVD. The picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. It is almost tolerable if you turn brightness, color and images to the maximum ... but the problem does not end there. The sound is also inconsistent, loud in the parts, virtually inadmissible in others. <br /> <br /> And, as far as languages ​​are concerned, it is a major problem for English speakers - the double option has some good actors and some really terrifying performers who collapse and parts of the movie are not called , sliding back into Russian and even French randomly. The subtitle option is not much better. Subtitles do not appear under the image, but even over it - hiding some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the landscape. In addition, subtitles are often a bad translation (a shame as the script has had pains to be so close to Tolstoy's real words), and subtitles too seem to give up only parts. <br /> <br /> So even if you maximize colors, brightness and image settings and turn the volume to the end of the volume and choose English subtitle * and * doubled, you will still get a movie that is annoying to watch and listen. Perhaps content exceeded this? You may have been able, but at seven o'clock - who can last so long? Perhaps someday somebody will come back and restore it - and maybe then I will see a masterpiece - but for now, I can not give more than one star to something I was just able to look at the first 12% of the.
