I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, why did we rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see the places I know in a movie. I really realized I did not want to make jokes inside, so I was not surprised when I stood with the deck in the headlights. What I was surprised was the ant-non-Mormon actions that were placed in this film. I know it's a Mormon movie, cared for by the members of the LDS Church, but it seems to me offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who is not their faith. Every non-Mormon, who was not very much, drank, smoked, and had an amazing attitude of selfishness, why? That's what really made me feel about this movie, they made Mormons so pure, yet the rest of the state of Utah. I think it's full of psycho-psychics just because they do not follow the Scriptures of the LDS Church. I can understand that it takes place around all LDS members, but you thought Salt Lake City was a 100% Mormon, which is not even close to being the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunk drunkards, please! I just do not understand because I do not belong to their faith and I guess you never.
