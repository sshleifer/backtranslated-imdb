An inexpensive film exploiting a mother searching for her daughter, who was kidnapped by people doing porn movies. The route leads my mother across Europe as she seeks her child and we in the public's struggle to stay asleep. This is one of the countless soft films that are made for people who want porn starving without the stigma or danger of showing on their credit bill. Personally I would rather have the stigma because these films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we see. This should be a sexy thriller, but it is not. Often his people talking about things followed by a lot of walking from one place to another and leading to lead.Periodic through the movie different people get naked and everything has more than a touch of S & M to the procedures. Violence and fetish material are like causing a laugh rather than a horror or even emotion, all so incredibly false. Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep the interest. (Actually, I'm looking for the course for many of these films) You forgive me for the lack of details, but it's just a boring boring movie that I've been through to the end hoping something from remote, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was a scary hair blonde with a huge bite and a Buick's nose. I looked at her with a morbid fascination, wondering how she looked like a young girl and wondering if she had a plastic surgery, not the type of things you should think of in a thriller. Avoid.
