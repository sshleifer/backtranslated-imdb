One of the many songs that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is notable for early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies quite early, and the rest of the film is totally forgotten. During the Christmas break, a group of students are committed to releasing a college-led building. A crazy killer, however, throws a key in the work by methodically killing young people one by one in a variety of terrible ways. The exploitation of each n 'slash ratchet clanged in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow offers a boring and unconscious horror that asked me for the characters to be killed so I can continue to pursue something more meritorious. Most deaths (which, to meet them, why we generally see this type of film) are short and not so naughty; the only really serious picture comes at the end of the year when the victims' bodies are discovered by the surviving survivor (there is a very disagreeable corpse, the film could have been done with more). At the last moment, the movie is rescued by the disappointment of getting the lowest score possible from me, having a nice finish that does not expect, but this is really one for completists only slasher.
