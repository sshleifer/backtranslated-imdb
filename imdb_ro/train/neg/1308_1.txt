What really makes me feel about this movie (that is, working on this movie that makes me physically ill) is that someone paid to do it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this film. It's not frightening, it's not provocative, it's not fun, it's not good. It's a cyanide sleeping pill. The case of the DVD compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and some other decent films, making the film's despair very obvious. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; is far, much worse. The claims of an "extremely shocking end you will never forget" are the equivalent of a ton of excrement of dirty horses. Please do not ever waste your time tracking this piece of garbage because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this movie should be removed from the list of Writer's Guild members and never allowed to shoot anything again. Because if he thinks this is a movie worth doing, he probably does not have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the soul of any unlucky person to see that. I'm going to vomit right now.
