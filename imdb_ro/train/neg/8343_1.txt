Salvation is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing terrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a good way. First of all, I do not see how so many people can think of this piece of nonsense such a great movie. If I write something so boring and ridiculous, I would have laughed and too shy to oblige others. Second: The act is terrible and the lead actress is very ugly. Third: The story is shit, it was used before and excuse that a cheap movie is not an excuse. Read the summary on the back of the case, reveal the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes to lose something that will let you regret having seen it. I feel really bad about those crooks and the irony of their name. All Hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
