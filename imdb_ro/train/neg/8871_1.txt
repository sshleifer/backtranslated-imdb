I've probably seen 200 movies a year, both at theaters and at home, and I can say for sure that this movie is by far the worst movie I've seen this year (if I have not seen "Quest of the Knights of Delta "inca). This movie is just a bad joke after a bad joke directed at the age of 13, and because I was unhappy to see her on a bus trip I could not leave. Do a favor and jump over this one in the rental corridor. The four dollars could be better spent on any Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
