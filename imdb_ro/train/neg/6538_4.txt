I read my comment about CASA CARE ESTE SCREAMED, many may assume I'm about 14 years old who think SCREAM is considered a "horror" classic. This is not the case because I am 30 years old and have watched horror movies for most of my life. But, of course, I am a child of the 80s who grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc ... horror movies - so I usually prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting or in this case film - but not necessarily like them - can appreciate why some people can enjoy this type of movie ... just do not ... < <br /> HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an extremely boring and boring film about a school for disturbing girls. The heavy master of the school pronounces with an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son who sneaks around and peeps the girls while they shower (in their night no less (?!?) ...), and meanwhile, girls disappear from school because they are the victim of a murderer who is hiding on the campus ... I can see why CASE CREATE is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a movie in my opinion ...), in terms of school atmosphere itself and the interaction between girls and their guardians - but this movie is so boring and unfortunate that I could barely stay awake. They are all for "tension" and "suspense" in horror films - but this film did not happen to me either. Luckily, I did not expect to go into this, so I can not say that I was really disappointed - THE CASE THAT SCREAMED only reinforced the fact that I personally do not enjoy the most horror movies much older than at 70 a. This is not a hard and fast rule, but the ones we've certainly enjoyed seem to be more than an exception. Probably a "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy more subdued and suggestive horror films - but, as I do not know too many fans of this kind of material, I can not recommend ... 4/10
