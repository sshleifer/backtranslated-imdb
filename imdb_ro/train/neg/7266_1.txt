... and yet we were told that there was another hour and 20 minutes left. Why, why did not there be an editor telling the writer / director to snatch, snip? It seems the writer / director has made short pants in the past; as a short, this would have been okay. But the lack of dialogue begins to be in twenty minutes. Lack of many eyes on music. Background noise (talking, traffic, and especially an omnipresent helicopter) is aging very quickly. But the worst failure is in the story. There are little precious shortly. After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost screamed at the screen: "I got it, I got it !!!!!" It's amazing that after we left the theater, we could go home, watch the daily show and parts of the Colbert report, get ready for bed, and know that the audience was still in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to spoil your vision. You have to give the public enough to share your vision.
