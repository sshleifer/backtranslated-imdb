When we decided to watch this movie, we thought it would not succeed. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and all the people I spoke saying they liked it. I was beaten into beatings. From my side, I felt Billy. Crystal's character was extremely unidimensional and did little for the movie. Sure, he broke some good jokes, but as a character he just did take place. And poor Julia Roberts. In previous shows, she plays well as a strong, willing lady. In this movement, she seems to be completely repressed and has very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts that my wife likes to look at. OK, if I found a good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. That's the entertainment. But, like Billy Crystal, almost nothing is shown by its character. If you are looking for a night of mindless laugh, with a very low redemption value, go see it. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your movie. There is none of the above.
