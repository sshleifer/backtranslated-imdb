Griswalds wins the TW game, shows "the big pig in a prize" and they all fly together in Europe, where they manage to cause a stupid disaster after another. Of all ridiculous, non-functional money-laundering secrets, this is the batch. Harold Ramis's film, in 1983, was a sub-average mistake, in which the misfit family traveled to an evening holiday in the United States. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") acts what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" that will bother you more than make you laugh. Hughes' script (with Rob Klane) terrible and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have bothered a deadly project because even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca made sense to refuse the offer. Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is not able to pick up the action at any level he can call it fun. However, as it can not be expected, the "European vacation" has been successful enough to justify a second sequel! It certainly could not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I've seen a national show of lamps that deserves to disturb him. Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
