Well, what is it ?! I found Nicholson's character superficially and, unfortunately, uninteresting. The character of Angelica Huston blew my strength. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty slut, not a good slut. It's not that they do not "understand." It's not that I do not think some ideas could lead to anything more. This is a movie with nothing but the idea that we should accept these ideas and that's what the movie does. That Nicholson falls for Turner is absurd, but again, it is intended to be so. However, this does not make me to be a.) Funny, or b.) ... really interesting far! It was a waste of my time, so do not let your hype have the best of you ... it's a waste of time! With all that has been said, the opening sequence of the church is quite beautiful ...
