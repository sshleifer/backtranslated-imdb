I could never look at Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I had problems when the best scene in this movie came from Scott Baio (the skateboard tracking scene!). Jodie Foster, in her first "adult" role, turns into regular professional performance, but this is no excuse for this boring misery. Two hours of my life that I will never come back again! No notable character, incredible story, questionable editing, and terrible cinema, but the worst of all, I can not care less. The story of teenage teens in California in the 1970s, where children live miserable lives, and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly apology for a movie.
