<br /> <br /> The Red Killer Attack is a "parody" of bad monster films that end up being worse than the movies they spoofs. The story (very poor) tells of tomatoes that rebel against those who treat them badly. Basically, they rotate and rumble (yes, they are mourning) and the next thing you know is covered with ketchup. Actors are names that have never made movies, so there's no point in naming them. There is a guy who is employed by the government to try to stop the danger of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who is the master of disguise, and a girl and a guy who sinks. However, there is another woman who spies the first guy who works for the government. if that does not make much sense to you, you understand. This movie would not have been very good in the first place, but she does not even like having fun with stupid scenes. The movie is horrible, despite being a point of view, it really hurts what could have been a (reasonably) film of entertainment. At one point, a giant red wax "slips" on an unimaginable wood carving on it! Perhaps I would have recommended the movie if it had a pleasant value on the camp, but even this is missing from this terrible movie. 2/10
