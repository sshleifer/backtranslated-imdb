For years, I remember reading this "Trouble With Tracy" show in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 o'clock in the morning! I lived about an hour two hours north of Toronto and I could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was about. Did she have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was it nudity? Was he suspense? Was it a comedy? It would have been good if it was a promotion of the show. At least I could have known what I missed. But no! The mystery made my way until CKCO, affiliated to CTV, built a transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am! One Saturday morning I got up and started the TV at 5:59 and finally I came to see what was "The Trouble With Tracy." Yes, "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and stayed in harmless place 6 am, so no one would ever see how terrible it was. Talented Canadian studio Steve Weston died a few years after many claimed that he "died" the first time he appeared on this show. When I saw it for the first time on the morning of the cold Saturday and I fell hopelessly in my bed, some of me died too.
