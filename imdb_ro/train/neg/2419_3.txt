Simply give this three, because I do what my buddies wanted and hoped to do: Have fun. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this thought as a zombie movie from there with Romero or Fulci, but what I was renting was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for fun or a movie that makes you head shake, go to him. This is perfect for junior fans - "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it's so bad, it's fun on its own. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when a movie sucks like this, it has its own genre .
