This film begins with the execution of a witchcraft practitioner and his mistress. His head is cut and buried separately from the body ... it sounds like "A thing that would not die," is it? Well, it's playing a bit like this, but once the body is reunited, all the exciting and terrible death is done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean, the movie has only 88 minutes and I always thought "When will it end"? The characters in the movie are mostly idiot and deserve to die a lot because they're really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he moves slowly and you really wonder how he can do anything, as he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing to keep track of after your head is reattached is the fact that there are so many tits that turn on that you really start losing. Still, I want to see a horror film, not a soft pornographic background, and a horror film is the way to slow down in slow moving to make it somewhat pleasant. And he does not read the back of the box, as he did as a zombie who eats attacking the city, there is ... just a small scene in which three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily rejected I'm not film factor, and their scene is rather useless. So for the most part, I say that you should avoid this movie if you will not meet it because it is very cheap.
