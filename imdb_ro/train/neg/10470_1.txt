What else is it allowed to say? I have read all the reviews here and most are right on. . However, a person even went so far as to name this bad film and that Satan stabbed him (or something along these lines). Bad?! Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN made this movie. Open your eyes, please. Indeed, this was the lowest degree of propoghandish stupidity that has come over the years. The most terrifying thing about the Omega Code is how much money they have spent to succeed. If this movie can be made, there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses Omega codes". For those of you who are in Bible stories, the new Dogma movie will take over where the Omega Code has never begun.
