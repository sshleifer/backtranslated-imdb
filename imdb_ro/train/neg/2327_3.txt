This filming comes immediately from the closed dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company earned fame and fortune in the first half of the 90's by producing terrible evil and syrup horror movies. The most famous disasters in their works are "Subspecie", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these is recommended, and neither is Dr. Mordrid. Superb director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is staggeringly stupid and cheesy and almost completely humorous. I just saw him seeing Jeffrey Combs. I find he can have more disadvantages if you are a fan of him. For every good movie, it looks like he made the 5 lower ones. Anyway, the story relates to the struggle between two old wizards. A good one, which is here for 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one called the evil Kabal. He wants to destroy any form of human life for some reason I have forgotten. Combs receives instructions from the mentor. This guy has only a pair of eyes in space. Very very cheesy, that's it! Every once in a while a dazzling lightflash is displayed on the screen, but that's the only form of special effects this movie has. Everything is just a piece of crying and cocking, and when the two wizards finally face each other, it ends before you know ... I'd have waited for the evil sorcerer to get a little revenge but nooooooo. In some scenes, you can indeed detect some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals), and if you really pay attention, you might find even a few small but beautiful that is called Edgar Allen), but in general it is a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he certainly does not have to put a stupid maillot on it.
