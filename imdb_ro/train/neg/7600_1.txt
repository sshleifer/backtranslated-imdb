This movie proves that good action comes in a good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but in this case he is a minor. Donald Sutherland meets as an amateur. Why? Because the script is terrible, the adaptation is terrible, and actors seem bored and hearts rather. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it was over and I halted it. The director did a really bad job, and although I did not read the novel, it is certainly a missed chance. The atmosphere in which this film tries to evoke, and the message and the story never reach the audience. In a word, it's a TERRIBLE movie.
