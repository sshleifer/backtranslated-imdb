This has to be one of the worst fillings I've ever seen and seen a few. It is slow, boring, amateur - not even consistent in simplistic reading of the plot. Actors do not act. I can not blame them - they were given a banality scenario so full that all I can do is go through it with a pain behind their eyes, which has nothing to do with the evil that goes to SummersIsle. /> There is no moment in this movie that sounds true - not an honest line and no single moment in which someone is moved. The character of Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that he does not feel a compassionate smidgeon for him through all his troubles. I do not doubt that I saw a man suffering there, but Nicholas Cage was fully aware that he was in the worst film of his entire career.
