It could have been a good episode, but I just had to stop him. The British representation was horrible to look. Have the producers ever put foot in the UK before filming? At least the leg in England? I do not think a British person had such an accent, apart from a royal family comedy story! Also, with the two English boys ... and I do not think an English boy acted, spoke or was dressed like any British child in the history of the British nation from the precious public appearances of Prince William and Harry. For US film producers. In the UK there is more than one country. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. more than one culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but that was so bad I could not look. The fire seemed cold, though!
