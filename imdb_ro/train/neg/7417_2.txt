This movie is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! - that it is hard to imagine that we will see a movie worse this year or the next few years. "The Brother of Love" (established in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but a superficial scandal about the Italian culture to offer, and even says that Italians in and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film - the ugly people have to get married with ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - it really is discomfort. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in films such as "Suburbia" or "Lost in translation", but his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash like garbage!
