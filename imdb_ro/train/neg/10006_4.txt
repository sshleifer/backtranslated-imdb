I do not know who to come, the shy writers or the director without the guards. It seems to be one of those movies in which so much has been paid to stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there is not enough left to make a movie. This could have been very fun, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, hanging from each scene. Since he got a R rating, why was he shot with a 70-year-old woman and not with Angie Harmon? Why Sheen Sleep Through Potentially Hot Relationships With Two of the Most Beautiful and Sexy ACTRESSES in the World? If they just wanted to laugh why they did not throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta in return? It was so predictable that I was surprised to find out that the director was not five years old. What a loss, not just for viewers, but also for actors.
