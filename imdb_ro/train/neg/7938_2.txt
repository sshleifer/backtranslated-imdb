A family looking for old roadside attractions to include in his father's book, meets an old, old-fashioned, old-fashioned show led by an eccentric man with unique eyes. When their family vanity breaks off when they leave a star, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp, which has been the site of a jail prison decades ago. There were many films in Tod Browning's "(1932)," Alex Freeman "(1993), Alex Winter, which are both classic (or soon to be" Freaked "). they will never be, and if they ever get to the classic ... well, it will be a clear indication of the sad condition of our genre. "From the ridiculous opening song to the 17-year-old daughter who is obviously older than the mother the film was too much to do, the writing was highlighted, but not completely horrible ... just bored, the direction was poor, and the rare effects of strangeness were terribly terrible and unbelievable. pouring was even worse Anyone who believes in the age of these two teenage girls should not have met a teenager in a long period of time There was not enough gore and violence to compensate for the lack of any other qualities. and when there was one little bit of violence, it was not done at all. And I can not forget to mention the battle scenes that were, with all honesty, some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. Generally, this is a horror film that's easy to forget and badly done, which deserves to leave alone at the bottom of the dollar basket. Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
