Let Paul "sex on the brain" Verhoeven come up with a useless version and linen from the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he were to lead a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into a massive orgy. I do not bother my sex or even eat (check my other reviews) on the film, but honestly, it's obvious that the director has one mind and can not see interesting aspects about an invisible man's story than the strange implications he has. It's a shame because it could have been good if the movie did not spend so much time with an invisible Kevin Bacon woman. <br /> <br /> The actors' action game does everything with a scripted cheese script, but I felt sorry for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally scattered here. But what could I expect from the SHOWGIRLS directory, which, however, is much more fun than this dreadful and bad movie.
