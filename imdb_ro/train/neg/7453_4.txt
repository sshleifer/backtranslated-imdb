Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Bad letter and no direction too big. My main problem was that I simply did not take care of any of these people. Not the killer not the victims. The settings were quite unusual. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I did not even care about the end. He took his baby back. Great work! I wanted my money back.
