Could this be interesting? a home affair haunted in Japan in terms of a newly-built American family? but falls due to overly simplified treatment and the inadequacy of both the director and the director. The film suffers from the same problem I often face with the modern popular rebirth of such a native fare, that the spirits prove to be bad for no real reason than they expect to! In addition, does not offer much in the scarecrow department? a huge crab attack is just stupid? that in general ghosts have a specific character and make him act in a totally unusual way, such as Susan George seducting the diplomat / friend of the family Doug McClure and Edward Albert by forcing his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> At one point, an old monk returns to the house to warn Albert about danger if I stay there? in the end, he is called to exorcise the premises. However, history is forced to repeat itself and the tragedy is the only result of the tense situation created properly? leading to a violent but unintentionally fun atmosphere in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in a deadly karate duel! At the end of the day, this caused a loss of innocuous time? tolerable at only 88 minutes, but in no way essential viewing.
