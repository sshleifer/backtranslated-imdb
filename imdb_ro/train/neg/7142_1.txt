This is by far the MULTI movie I've ever seen. I was waiting for a cheesy movie, but at least with some car / races scenes. What I received was nothing. The racing scene is so low that it made them look like the cars "go fast". In a scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from 200 to 0 in 4 seconds just by circling. It's just ridiculous. If you want to see a real movie about cars, see the fast and angry series. They could be a little camouflaged, but 100 times better than this movie could ever hope to be. Better still look, though, watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made.
