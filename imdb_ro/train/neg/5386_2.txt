While being one of the "stars" of this film, it does not necessarily give me wisdom, I know pretty little of what was first there ... and what came to the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of the "freshman" and be very pleased. it was funny, sexy, shit, all the main requirements of a drive-in movie. you have to remember that this was shot and released before all the rest ... pets, pigs, etc. ... so in his own way, this movie really was before his time. for whatever reason, the movie was given to the main distributors who edit half of the original movie and then edit in (should I say "mixed?") The most random scenes ever. the kind of fat, the men with heads ... what the hell was that ?! I'm sure it was put for additional T & A, but it was so slow that it caused something before it ended until a stop and painful stop. but in all, it's a funny memory for me ... especially since I'm able to say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I am!
