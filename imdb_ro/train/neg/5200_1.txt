This movie is very weak. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of tension, but not too much to make you jump out of your seat. Start slowly with the tension building. Which is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although in some moments or moments I have to say it was a bit funny when people were shot and down. He should have done something like Scary Movie, then it could be a better movie. Because I watched only pieces of the movie, jumping over scenes and had to bore through the movie. I have to say that I felt sleepy looking at this movie, so I can say it is not worth it. Do not waste your time even if you thought about doing something with this movie, except leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
