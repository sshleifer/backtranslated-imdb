This is really one of the worst movies ever made. I think I'm a huge fan of zombie film and usually tolerate bad action, "special effects" blades, a bad story and anything you can see in second-rate movies as long as the movie has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or anything else to offer. It has virtually no positive aspect and is the third or fourth rat, perhaps worse. A few friends of mine and myself made a small film during the weekends and certainly did a better job (no zombie movie though). This movie is not even funny without talking about anything else. Very bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like ordinary people (except extra white skin drawn over their faces), TO THE MUSEUM of fake blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and zombie films being questionable but presented gore is simply stupid). The room stays long enough with feeding scenes, it becomes boring and you can not wonder why zombies use weapons (!) To kill their prey. I will not go into the details of duplication (others did). Although I am from Germany and I am a little curious about the original version, I will not lose more of my time with this movie. Keep away from it, as far as you can.
