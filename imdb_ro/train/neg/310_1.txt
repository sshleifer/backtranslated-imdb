I never heard of Adam Sandler until I saw him on the wall at Blockbuster. Being a Adam Sandler fan at the time, we rented it. Frankly, I could only see 30 minutes. from her. It was terrible. Do whatever is necessary to keep this from the public's hands. I sincerely hope this movie goes OOP soon, and I hope STAYS THAT WAY!
