Even when I saw this movie in a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Zadora played in a movie about an artist who slept his way to the top. How beautiful and sexy she is to Madame Zadora, she even could not keep this vengeance of a movie from the reservation. Not even her photo for Penthouse, where "The Lonely Lady" was not promoted "the same day," could keep this movie in the tank. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A totally different script. Give him a miss.
