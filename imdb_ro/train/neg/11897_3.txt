William Lustig's follow-up to "Maniac" demonstrates conclusively that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and Spinell's convincing performance, "Maniac" would never have made the cult hit he did. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with a simple script that tells you everything and is predictable at every step, and mediocre performance of all actors. Judging from the "already vu" sense, this movie gave me, Lustig saw "Death Wish" a few times too much before doing that! (* 1/2)
