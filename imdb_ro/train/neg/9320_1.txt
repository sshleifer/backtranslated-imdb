If this movie was a comedy, I'd give it 10. Oh, where do I start? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this makes Troll 2 look like it saved Ryan privately. It's like a group of porn film makers have decided to make a horror film, they have changed their minds to the middle of production and decided to make a comedy, then they turned back to horror and then decided it would be she had to stay with just porn. Everything about this movie is simply terrible: the musical score (someone shooting the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the direction, the cinema, the act. There are simply no words to describe this. Oh, wait, yes there is: Holy * *%!
