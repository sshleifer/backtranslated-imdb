At the end of the movie I asked myself: "is the worst movie I've ever seen or is the worst movie I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... Actually, after seeing this movie and thinking a little about it, you can not find any meaning, and you can only remember the two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to push this question into the crowd's head: "what kind of crimes are compared to the horror of war and extermination?" because in the first scene you can see here the fury that screams and at the same time you hear a speech by President Bush about the need to start a war with Iraq, and in the second scene, the images of the three criminals holding a sword in a woman's vagina are directly followed by the archive images of the Second World War. But as a real matter, I could not think of the relative gravity of these two different ways of expressing human horrors, made too shocked by what I have just seen and felt (I'm sorry for bad English)
