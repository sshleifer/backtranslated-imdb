First, IFC runs the City and Country, and now this. The difference between that stinker and this crossover Pink Panther is that the city and the country were visible. This is not possible. I can only assume that the cast has been registered for this so that she can go to Europe on someone else's money. Belushi is especially irritating. His stage with Candy (making a Z-grade Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of talented shepherd and bet that the prisoners at Gitmo would break like nuts! The "Crime" real (besides being lit up in green) is the character of Shepherd: the wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy this, I have an oceanfront property in Arizona, you might be interested!
