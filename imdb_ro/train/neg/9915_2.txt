I've just finished the "Closed Room," known as "Surveillance," and I'm amazed. Dizzy, not film, but some of the reviews we searched that influenced my eyes. The story was so devastated by plot holes, and most of those who acted so flat, qualifying it as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I woke up shaking my head and laughing at the amazement as I endured this movie. Justin leaves the limits of his home life with a mother dependent on pain, to go alive with his father, despite his mother's warnings that the father is not good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin gets suspicious of the tenants living in the adjoining apartments. With the help of a couple of friends, he installs hidden rooms to keep the tables on these people. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. A positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would very much like a star or two more, if it had slipped a little, but no luck. It would have been the potential rescue grace of the film. Eric Conley played Justin well, I thought, and I would not be surprised to see more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, although affected by clich√©s, could have worked if it were not the "ridiculous shows" of key members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Horror! (forgive me) <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget movies. Indeed, I think independent film is our only hope of making decent film in the coming days. I'll give up on low-budget movies pretty little when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and overall image quality. However, I do not agree to be allocated for the role of a stick and for a cheese cheese lover. There are a large number of low-budget, proficient films out there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can only guess that at least a few commentators who praised the "Closed Chamber" are to some extent affiliated with its production.
