Without affinity with any type of filming and the sound appreciation of the documentaries, I can honestly say I was angry at myself that it bothers me to sit on the whole length of "20 data." I will not waste time with the plot, you can read more reviews. But I'll say that Berkowitz's narrative, in Woody Allen's style, was extremely annoying. Either you wanted to give up coffee or inhale some tranquilizers. It is possible for Berkowitz to make it clear that this film was a bad idea because some parts detail his attempts to fund the documentary. Forgive me for listening to insults as compliments, but I'll give credit to Berkowitz for having the skills to convince an idiot to fund this terrible piece of ****. I appreciate the boundaries and intentions of the film here, but even as far as Berkowitz's standards set for himself, he bursts and loses on all levels. In conclusion, I'm sure many of these female comrades did not feel at ease in a meeting with someone who wants to be filming and therefore question the sense of authenticity of the film. Hey Myles, I liked the movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as a Seinfeld episode or it was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
