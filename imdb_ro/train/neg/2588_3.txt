Band Band was awful, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight DVD in the American Pie franchise looks the same quality as the predecessor. Actually, Erik Stifler (John White) broke up with his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike Cooze Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join Erik Dwight's cousin (Steve Talley) at college. With the promise of many parties, many drinks, and hot dogs at Casa Beta, they have only fifty tasks listed to become official privileged members. But a threat comes with rivals GEK ("Geek"), led by Edgar (Tyrone Savage), who is hungry in power (and sheep), offering more and better than what Beta has. To resolve it once and for all, Beta and Gek are fighting for forty years forbidden Greek games to beat each other while the loser moves away. The latest game champion, Noah Levenstein aka father of Jim (the only director Eugene Levy) leads the show that sees the people who did not blow bras, gladiator duel floating on the water, catches a fried pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with dog cartridges old wife carrying and drinking a barrel full of alcohol (with puking not disqualification). Everything comes to a sudden death, with a guy dancing a strip strip and having to oppose cumming, the Beta House wins when Edgar gets drunk with a girl dressed like a sheep in his lap. They also starred with Christopher McDonald of Flubber as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is very slight, like the thickness of the jokes, and I can think that a five-star star was rated, but I like it. Suitable!
