I'm a B-boyfriend, give me a mutation gene and I'm in heaven. These films are good to make you stop thinking about everything that's going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then it was Hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb to warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark man, which the film barely touched. In order to keep interested spectators, blood has just been made every few minutes. During an attack scene, the camera took off the attack, but you saw what appeared to have been dropped by a screenwriter to tell you that the attack was bloody and that the person was probably dead (what special effects fabulous). Back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were kept blank, and testing equipment had to be monitored through breast tissue. Anyway, this movie had a bad development of the plot, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say a very bad action. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo, or Jeffrey Combs could not save this mess.
