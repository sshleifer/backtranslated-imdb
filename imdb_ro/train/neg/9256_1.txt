Needless to say about a bunch of half-naked men who hit and hit each other. That's it. About for five minutes we see this. He is shot in black and white, with tons of half-naked men, running around to slap each other over the terrible music song. He looks interesting, but there is no plot and indeed - the inherent violence in this has disturbed. Also homo eroticism in this case is played, but the mixture with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde materials may like this, but I realized it was incomprehensible, boring, bad and (occasionally) disturbing. Indeed - what is the point in all this? I saw her as part of a homosexual pants festival, and the audience stood there in a sharp silence. I really wish I could walk less than 1.
