Check out the movie site, more time has been put into doing it than in writing script for this movie. It could not be more in the fact that she boasts. An original story? Original? Perhaps they have discovered the hidden scenario between the old testament or faced with legal repercussions for that little horn. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a cup of ear wax. Cinematography? Oh yes, America's funniest home movie is still classic. I'm sure they have little money available for this title, so of course, they're not that good, or bad every now and then, or just funny, but the story makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled in one and all of them, without the brain, they saw - befores and done - already.
