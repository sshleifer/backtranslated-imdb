I see that a lot of people liked this movie. For me it was a movie made of the right to write 101 and the person failed in class. Since Lindsey Price recorded the video by the end of the movie, it was very predictable. I kept looking to see if it went anywhere. First we have a widow's father. Clone # 1 movies / TV always kills the parent of the mother if the child is a girl or a chick of boys, so that the single father can get fainter over his dead wife and seem completely out of his baby care item. Starting from my 3 sons to 2½ daddy. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play an important role in the film. And he will always have solutions or even if that person is an airhead <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is a stranger must be of Latin origin. And they must be illegal. There seems to be no legal and illegal Latino of Europeans, unless there is an element of IRA involved. <br /> <br /> Cluster # 4 said Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case he was a teacher who made 200 months. And he said higher education Latino has to act now that he has no brain in his head now and let the air blow his head take the shot. The party <br /> <br /> # 5 Crime The felony committed really was not a crime, it was an accident. But because in this case he has lost all the sense that he had when crossed the border he now acts as a blistering fool, and now he put his own daughter in danger of taking her long on a queasy search at the border with the blow idiot side. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6. Never lead a villain running from a murder, but a little cute kid. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the movie, and because the person who accidentally killed the child can have a ridiculous interaction with their parents. <br /> <br /> Clique # 7 Name me a movie where a policeman is not an angry veterinarian and gets involved with a beginner. Even if they are killing detectives who must be the most experienced policemen on a police force. Sev7n and Copy Cat and the Law and the Order come to mind immediately. And the veterinarian, even if he does not have a heart of gold, has a heart of gold. Cliché # 8 Let's go and round up some soap dishes. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell OMI can not let go of a paper bag and when he uses it to live in one life to live, Marty leaned from right to left each time he opened his mouth. Use to get sick of the sea. It could be anchored better now, but she still can not act. The film could have been deeper if it was not full of clichés. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But that was just bad. SPOILER **** Now I will not hurt the end. Oh, because I think it will be a service to mankind to let a person lose their time when they will not return to watch this movie. It involves Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has ever seen a movie before you had to see what's going on. The father even makes a terrible mistake from the cops at the end and is shot by the angry veteran, who suddenly is very upset. You think he thought the poor guy was innocent throughout the movie and shot him by mistake. When she did not. Now for the little girl the father brought with him. Guess what's going on with her? Up, she ends up living with the family whose child was murdered by her father! Come on! You all know it will happen, because she is a replacement child! That's why he did not go with Lindey Price's character. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult to me. Because there were so many ways, this movie could explore and descend, but chose to take the cliché. The 2 stars are for 2 stars, the little girl I thought very good and Lindsey Price, which character was annoying, but she did what she could with her. My advice is to take a vice and tighten your head with him instead of looking at this derbedeu
