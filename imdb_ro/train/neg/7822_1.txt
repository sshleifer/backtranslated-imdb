This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic theme. I liked Superman's movies, but that made me want to shoot myself. Very weak actions, scandalous special effects and a plot equal to zero. To sum up: Superman leaves the ground because scientists have discovered pieces of his home planet, some have been in space (spirit), I do not tell my girlfriend anything before going (spirit again), taking off in a a space ship (on the back I think 5 years later, and I look forward to meet with his girlfriend again (who now rays his son, who, in my humble opinion, is at least 7 years old.) And what do you say by Lex Luthor Trying to grow a new continent to sell land Please! I voted 1 out of 10 for this movie just because I'm not allowed to vote 0. If you have something else to do with your time, you're not going to see this movie, and even if you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch TV!
