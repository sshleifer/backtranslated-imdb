Is not there anything on television? Are you really bored? Then watch Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and, of course, do NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. I looked at the TV and woke up laughing at certain points. I did not laugh a lot and did not laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments, to which I laughed. If you are looking for an extremely funny "hood" movie, then watch on Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie is trying to ...), watch something like Jupiter Dreams or Jason Lyric. If you are looking for some good "prey" black go watch a porn movie Dominique Simone, because nudity in this movie is almost nonexistent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on the cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 of 10 ***
