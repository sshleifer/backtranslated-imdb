Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, the one-line summary says it all. "Le Samurai" from Melville is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And I'm better - much better! In the Samurai, Alain Delon is a warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in the cage and steals cars for his jobs (with so much suspense in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: the samurai seeks death in dignity and is shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed and he has realized and there is no room for samurai in it. Delon does not kill so many people like the Ghost Dog. But I think Jarmusch liked "Leon" or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez very much. And he added that too. And let me guess: the girl will become a professional like a Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all? Where is the original thought in this movie unique? I can not see the point of making carbon (celluloid) children. A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
