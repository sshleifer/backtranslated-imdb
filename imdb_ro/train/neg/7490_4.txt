This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin attempted to appear as Perfect Prosecutor and only a prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense counselors or tried to challenge the audience with a real real debate about how a country is driven in such a terrible way. Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazi point of view, but HAS BEEN THE POINT OF NURNBERG! Four hours of mockery just the Nazis. That's already done! Do you really think that Alec Baldwin should remain just the husband of Kim Bassinger. Immediately after the end of the film, TNT showed the 1959 film Trail at Nuremberg. The film is FAR superior.
