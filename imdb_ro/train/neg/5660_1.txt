I'm glad to read so many negative comments about the Tritter plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. He likes Gruff's nature and House's intelligence, but he does not like the revenge of this continuous plot at all. It cuts in the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority. It must have a more caretaking nature instead of revenge for everyone at the hospital. It also appears that there are many controversial legal issues about what Tritter does. He alone can not freeze accounts and has the authority to stop doctors prescribing prescriptions to patients. A lot of vindictiveness it shows also hurts sick patients from the hospital and it's not a good story to portray. I voted for the terrible episode not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor song, it stops me and the rest of the plot is hurt by her. People say they no longer want to follow story lines. Change it. Get Tritter out.
