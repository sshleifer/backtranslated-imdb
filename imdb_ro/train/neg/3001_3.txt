Slaughter Shout revenge story of a guy fucking who fell victim to one of the coldest and most cold joke in movie history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the blow went straight to hell. A very boring and redundant mess, with mediocre slashing and half an hour, that has breathed a new level of suckness. The guy who played the nerd committed suicide shortly after the film was released. If you want to rent the movie, stop it after joke and remember, choose life.
