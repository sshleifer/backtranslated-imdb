I read the novel "Jane Eyre" for the first time in 1986. It was around that time that I saw the BBC version of Timothy Dalton and Zela Clarke. It was an excellent version and very similar to the book. A few years later I put my eyes on this version and I was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast like Mr. Rochester. Mister. Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt interprets it as an ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like seeing two zombies together. This is the story of love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. A great time is guaranteed.
