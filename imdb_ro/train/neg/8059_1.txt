This film refers to a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), who leaves her family and is heading to become a baccalaureate student. One night, Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with lots of drink and dance, and Cassie travels with her boyfriend who likes it, but never told him he loves him. As Cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and could not avoid an accident and as a result there was a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie gets very emotionally upset and has nightmares that make her have hallucinations about her life-buddling friend and meets men trying to kill her and strives to find out who her real friends are, who wants her dead and it will survive the whole horror attempt. Cassie dreams that she is loved by her boyfriend after she has died and finds another guy in her bed and is told to ask her to make love. This is a movie and not too good.
