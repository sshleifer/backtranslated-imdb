Considering that these people are facing so many photos, using old movies and finding animals to remove them, not to mention that some scenes were shot on a set created with the actors, what do you think? The old film of the countries is beautiful, but the abuse of animals and the degradation of the locals is painfully traced in these films. I know, racism is fine in these old movies, but there is more to this crew losing its credibility. Represented as flyers, they never flown with their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaduvillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while collecting their royalties, denying the apparent depression of his wife using a cute prop, unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. It was okay as a director and a photographer, but that's all.
