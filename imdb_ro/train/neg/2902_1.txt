Spoiler: A lot of passive-aggressive people who have family meetings. The script makes them say and do things people would never do, at least anyone who has a piece of decency. The hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate in a bookstore on the day of the meeting, not knowing he will appear as his brother's girlfriend at the meeting. He tries to delay his brother's claim, but she, knowing that our hero is clearly infatuated with her, tears him ruthlessly through sexy clothing, and acts like a striper, shaking his brother in a shame of shame to show him how to stretch. At one point, she gets naked and gets drunk with him. He's trying to cover his eyes. His heart breaks. She thinks it's funny until she suddenly decides she does not want her brother and leaves the meeting. The movie is really shooting. The audience roared and fled in its long way. Writing is unintelligible and unbelievable. We almost came out, but we continued to think for sure that something would happen that would make things safe but nooooooo. All the wonderful reviews must have been written by the paid tricks to beat the poor suckers like me to see nonsense like that. Comparing it with Little Miss Sunshine ??? Jeez. Be ashamed of them, writers, actors, producers and theaters to leave something on the screen!
