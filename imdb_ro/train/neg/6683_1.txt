I'm glad that IMDb's have been able to decipher what kind of film they fall into. I had a suspicion of trying to be a comedy, but it also seems to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, it's amazing to deny even the slightest humorous incursion - even until the ridiculous "twist" ends, which confirms a total loss of time for the entire movie. It is hard to describe how repugnant the answer is. Does anyone involved in this movie have any idea what they should do? It is worth looking, in fact, to look at the screen of unbelievers about how terrible it is.
