He recently saw this movie and had bigger hopes. It does not rely on the director, who has not made a cinematic show, but more on the basis of his distribution. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in the double body, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) starred in great movies. Not together, but this has not changed precisely because of this movie. The movie is incredible, very predictable and clickable. The only thing that could make it appealing is the choice of locations where it was shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time with this.
