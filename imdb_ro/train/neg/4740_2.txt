I'm so insulted by this movie, it's not even funny ... And I thought Mulan was unbelievable! Nevertheless, my Disney expectations have become, I have not realized they have done something so stereotypical. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, just for the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. I think they tried to do Wendy in an ordinary teenager ... But fortunately, most teenage teens - especially Asian teenagers - are far less obsessed with such superficial aspects of life. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls that are wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still quite decent scientists. Another stereotype, maybe, but one quite real. Because that's how the Chinese parents work. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If she wanted to go for authenticity, she would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a relationship of love and hatred with her family. That just adds my frustration to American films. Asian culture does not refer to vague, nature-oriented meditation and expression that sounds wise. We do not go out with an enigmatic smile all the time, and we do not all know a form of martial arts. We are PEOPLE and I would appreciate if someone writes an Asian part that does not describe us as a sad caricature.
