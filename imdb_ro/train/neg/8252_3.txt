What was the sound? It sounds as if it had been reprogrammed. Otherwise, bad. Plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Actor = evil, Harp = bad, Sex scenes - bad / bad trusted. However, I have seen it to the end in unbelief. How could such a good call of the actors do so bad? Will they ever have a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, I gave her 3, because we were at least in love to follow him all the way, because of his bizarre plot, etc. And for the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic joke in the 1940s. How was it done in 2004? OK, OK, there were some bits OK. They had a beautiful home in Bristol. Dougray had a beautiful boat. Jennifer looked nice in a small suit. But how did the sister receive all the people?
