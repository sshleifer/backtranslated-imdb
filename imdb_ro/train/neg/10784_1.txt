It was disgusting and painful. What a caste loss! I swear, the public (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent it. Zeta Jones was too bad to be credible. Cusack was fine. Just OK. I'm sorry for him (the actor) if people remember this mess. Roberts was just like her always. Beautiful and sweet, but for no purpose. Romanticism with John was completely unbelievable.
