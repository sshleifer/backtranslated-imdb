The worst kind of movie. In fact, the United States Declaration of Independence has been replaced by a plasma screen and it has tricked the security of the museum for a few days. Eh? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen that would work theoretically for less than 2 seconds on the watch battery, assuming it had a low internal resistance to provide the required current, which would not be. > <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large machine batteries and an inverter, but the system will not fit into the housing. I'm sorry I'm anal, but this is not even close to being plausible. The rest of the movie was not much better and I was wondering why the budget could not have been donated for charity or for me.
