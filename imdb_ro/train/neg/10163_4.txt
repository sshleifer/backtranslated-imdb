When I think of the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" comes at the end of the film, I remember the last years of "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. An undervalued, yet totally realistic portrait of the small city life. The title is a reason for contemplation. Maybe we, the audience, are the ones in "Bubble," because we have not paid any kind of payouts in the 90-minute thin movies. The public's reactions have often been self-satisfied and judicious, clearly indicating how detached people can be to see any humanity thread in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are the ones people refer to as those who put George W back into office for a second term. It is tremendous to think how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when we look at a leap of the public their feet to exit as soon as the credit role. This film has its merits and it deserves to be taken into consideration things that it does not say absolutely.
