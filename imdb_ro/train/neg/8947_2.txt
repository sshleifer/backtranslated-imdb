The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film has not embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, total recall was launched a few years later and it did a good job, even an orange watch launched in the '70s did a good job trying to make a futuristic world. The German German expressive colors, the black and white film in the viewing screens, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar job, yet dresses as if would work with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to adopt a communist mock-up approach to establish the design, the atmosphere and the theme, but the novel does not necessarily impose a communist, humble, humble theme in itself. This book needs to be seriously adapted in a modern context because this book is more relevant today than ever. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of these crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of predictions is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when it is exactly what is needed to bang the messages of the novel to the spectator.
