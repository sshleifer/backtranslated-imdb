Lynne Ramsey takes pictures of the arrest, and Samantha Morton can make a gesture. So what a bad luck to discover the lost talents on this squeaky, pretentious manners. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring to life Callar. Her attempts are too artistic and oblique. Repeatedly, the camera is on the long silent photos of the agonizing actress, as if Morton's usual look might give him a character. We are in a hell of self-warfare self-indulgence: For a movie that has a few minutes to get rid of bugs crawling on the floor, you might think it might end up revealing its protagonist. But how will he do it if he rarely speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, celluloid Morvern Callar is no one. I find it wonderful that Ramsey has split Morton many times. That being said, the first ten minutes were so impressive, shot and edited, my hopes growing. Give the film so much: knows how to make promises, if not how to keep anything.
