There was nothing of value in the original movie, it was even a lazer. The fact that I even found him to rent was absolutely amazing. Anyone connected to this movie must be great on something! So, what was the story? What was with the girl? The visionary had to receive the story line in the first four minutes of the film. Unfortunately, I tried several times to look at this. I even borrowed a baby from someone to get feedback. The kid said he was bad and he was four years old. It seems to me that there might be some credit for the director of filming, because some of the films made the movie more than a movie B. That could push it. I loved the theme song. Okay, it was just a dollar, it's worth it. I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were big, as should be the distribution and the crew. Is pot is legal in France?
