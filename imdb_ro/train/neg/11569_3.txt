Even if you subscribe to the anti-free-trade policy of the knee of this movie, it's still the same tired note, played again and again and again. Clink clink clink. Even if you can accept a peroxide hair preacher who advocates returning to the principles of primacy, Reverend Billy is hard enough to look like a serious figure. Reverend clown is the one who wakes up every morning without a more ethereal aspiration than to see his face on television before he goes back to bed that night. She has a beautiful wife, I have to admit, but it would take longer to save this terrible misery of a movie. Interurban bus journeys are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - through a colored line that moves on a map. Aww, you guessed it. Well, it has the virtue of being short. Is that the only thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yeah, I'm afraid.
