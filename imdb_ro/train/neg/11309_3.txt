A bad plot (although good for a B movie), good rapid battle scenes, no more than 5 out of 10. But something always bothers me about this movie: how does Mariska Hargitay never speak? In the TV version, she shares more intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. However, in the usual version (video), most of her scenes are cut and do not speak at all. This bothers me because it not only pulls out a female movie (though clicked) but makes the final shot seem terrifying. This movie would have been better if they had kept their scenes, because in those scenes at least they have a personality, one that highlights what Speakman says.
