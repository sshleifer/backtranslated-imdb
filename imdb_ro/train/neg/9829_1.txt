The premise pushed me, but it was clear about 30 seconds in which it was either David Lynch or something terribly terrible. Interesting to track just to go through the list of fundamental washings. I can be a sucker for a shaky spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it. The message seems to be that we have to pretend that we have an 80 yq (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to you?) And follow the blind in the Bible without any self-examination or trigger second coming. It's a kind of attitude that makes people jump with jumbo jets in 110-story buildings (I work around the corner of the former WTC site). I like to think God is a little bigger than that.
