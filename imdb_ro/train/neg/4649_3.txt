A 1957 (yes, this is the correct date) J. Arthur Production Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a shattered comedy, right? Oh, it's just terrible. It's a gag movie: people's eyes are shocked at the sight of a small aligator. Music is discarded, the most inappropriate and useful. Jeannie Carson is a full-bodied dancer and competent singer. But what was she doing in this movie? Diana Dors is here, offering such bold fires for use in previews. Its level of activity is not bad, but it is in the film to give someone to look at. Well, you have to do something other than groans during this movie. The movie is now sold on VHS by e-Bay people. Make your expenses and waste of time. A comedy without laughter. A musical without songs and dance memorable.
