I went to see this movie with low expectations, but hoping to be enchanted by watching my hometown on the film. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story covers a known territory (high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted, and the supernatural element adds little to this well-maintained theme. Although the quality of the act was good overall, the content of the film was terrible. The sexism of the film was blatant - women are apparently unfulfilled if they are not married, procreate or both (although this was formulated as a post-feminist choice). Worse was the racism - the Jewish mother, the black man still living at home - and the free cruelty (breaking the geek class). We should be ashamed if these characters are considered to represent the inhabitants of Kalamazoo, and writers should be crushed by having brought such broad and rough stereotypes on the screen.
