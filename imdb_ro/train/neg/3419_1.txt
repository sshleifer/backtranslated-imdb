OK, so Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to get this product sequel. I have one question - why? Who read this script and said: "Sound is wonderful! Original!" This movie is a stupid fool, it would not hurt my bowel. Of course, this is another story, following the tradition of the MIA, US Invasion, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so on, where Chuck Norris, of course, is the only man who can get the same America from bad guys. He does not even need guns. It's a stupid, patriotic jargon in the mind. A big surprise that the only one to lead Norris' film is Chuck Eric's son. Eric Norris worked primarily on his father's films and TV shows. Does this not strike anyone as a sign that he does not have a driving talent? Yet he directs the same people as before in the same stories as before ... only the difference is the name of the characters. If this is to make me patriotic and cheerful for the US, our country is in a much worse form than I have ever imagined. We hope this will be the nail in the coffin that acts from Chuck Norris.
