A mysterious mystery mystery with a predictable plot about the dangers of the Second World War. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. The best act is done by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor who became ill. He is the head of a spy ring trying to get information from the amateur Jane, coded information about allied activities. Will say? Can he remember? Moroni Olson (as Goodwin) is convincing as a Massey accomplice. The role played by John Garfield (like Dr. Lewis) is nothing disastrous. It seems so bad that pouring has to be classified as one of the worst in the history of the film. It is regrettable that such a talented actor is filled with a role that does not match his talent. The film deserves a single glance despite the fact that it is a half-spy and half-gangster film, and despite the fact that it contains a parade of stereotypical characters. It's easy to forget that, amnesia is not necessary.
