First things first . In this genre, the first thing you need is good music, and where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. The music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, who drew a letter "A" from his spelling, did a good job, but he had no use for a bad movie like this. Asin is like a doll that is used to amuse the audience, even if it is good to look but her role in the movie is to dance, in fact, she is dancing a member of a rock band and I do not think any rock band has there dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> In nut shell this film is a piece of shit a piece of *** t. Be careful if you want to be fooled.
