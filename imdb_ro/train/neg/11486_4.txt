Because some people, like me, want to know everything about a movie, even if it intends to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end, as I remember, because I could not be more than eight years old when I saw it for the first time on television. But I tell you, you certainly scared me of the kid I was, and I thought about it after a few days, and it still keeps on my mind, even if some details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember that! I did not even remember that Barnabus was in this movie and I loved the Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, even if I remember being an old family doctor or something instead of a judge, fade?) At the wedding venue , which, as I remember, is in a cavity of a kind? Maybe I was wrong; and Shelley Winters laughs, and the judge has a goat, and the angle of the room looks at him, and throws back the mantle and has bare legs and announces that she is actually her father, the Devil, and she even played in their hands (satanic cult) because the "mortal" guy he's in love with (I think Robert Foxworth) is also the guy Satan wants to marry her, The Demon with his yellow eyes and soon pretty sure he shows up Robert Foxworth and his eyes shining yellow. In the last minutes of the movie there are plenty of close-up photos. Everybody laughs and enjoys, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, crying or shouting or something, and that's the end. Bad guys win.
