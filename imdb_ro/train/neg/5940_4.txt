Look, I read and read these comments and there are many that I want to say, but I'll try to make it short, but clean ... First of all, let's forget how bad this movie has been. How did not he show anything about Notorious and agree with most people who say it was "Hollywood," that is, why would you expect a real story? When people wake up and see that u will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is covered and buried deep down. Second, I'm not against either 2pac or Biggie I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID are ashamed of this movie for sure ... Then for all those who say the movie is wonderful and can not see the truth, either u are too blind see too because u think you know something about BIG or you do not know anything about it at all and u love this Hollywood adolescent movies. Use your mind and see though the clouds ... There are a lot of things you could say when you get to this topic, I did not say 60% of what I have to say because it is a very wide topic, but for the movie I can only say it could have been a bit, I want to say a much better done thing. But anyway, I'm just a person who gives his opinion .... He does not have heavy feelings ... Look, I like hip hop and I live for this but after seeing this movie with every person with a bit of intelligence he could see that it is not as one would expect to live. All the respect for 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who make a life like this should return to the other page, because it destroys the youth .... Bring a wrong message to the kids and this is: at school, but living on the streets, hustling and just grabbing for paper .... True Hip Hop is supposed to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all. OK I know many of you will think I'm crazy, but that's my point of view. Look, I'm maybe wrong about something and im not saying it's a really bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17 years, 18 years I do not know anything about 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support and listen to their music ... Like most of you all out there. Only those who were very close to them and the murderers know the truth behind all these things. And for the end, I just want to say to all the fans and family of Biggie and Tupac, these two men have been and will be the greatest of all times, no matter how they lived their lives, but I AM PRAYING TO THE TASK OF THE FUTURE, YOU FEAST AND LOVE, THE OTHER, GOOD THING, even for those you do not like, because the end ... IT IS NOT NECESSARY WHEN MONEY OR THE FOLLOWING WILL BE FOLLOWED AND WHEN FOLLOWING THE FOLLOWING, WORKING TO BE THE MORE AND SUPPLY YOUR DUST, BODY AND MY MIND ... IF YOU ARE FINDING FIND YOU, I Will Live a Life even after death !!!! PEACE AND LOVE FOR YOU! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LEFT OY, JAM MASTER JAY and others who make a change in this world !!!!
