Okay, it's very rare to complain about something I've received for FREE. I think this movie pushed me over this limit. I saw her at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and I left very disappointed. The question of an audience member to the director about using native American references as well as "libraries", rather than being better blended into the film, basically tells what this movie has failed. <br /> <br /> Native Americans REFERENCES --- Native American references have been felt to be really missing and contracted. It is obvious that this director and writer have tried to deal with an arena they have not played before. He should have remained in the old sign of "write about something you know". If they are actually verses in this certainly did not show the film or the beauty of this unique culture has not received a fair justice. <br /> <br /> Clich√©s and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to see this movie on the basis that it was an indie. So I held it to bigger expectations. Little Miss Sunshine was indie and she saw her before she became so popular. Before I even got to wide release I was already raving how it would be a hit. UNFORTUNATELY we could not say the same about "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" led us to incidents of enemies, but directors were so intelligent in their approach that the outcome would lead us in another direction avoiding the trap of being a "cliche". This movie, on the other hand, could not get trapped because it was already TRAPPED from the beginning. Ancient psycho-mother, Hendrix couple etc. <br /> <br /> I do not like to say, but the best and best film I've seen this year were both Indians. Little Miss Sunshine is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. But I congratulate the directors for having such a good advantage from their family members at the cemetery.
