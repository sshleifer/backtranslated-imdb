I have not seen this and you do not intend to see this movie or anything else that includes Lindsay ... except until until "rich little rich girl" turns her life for a period of 2 years starting with the most recent arrest in July 2007. In fact, I do not know anyone who visited a recent Lindsay movie. Rather I imagine that 2007 will be the mark of water in her career film until she cleans up her act. Recent advertising only hindered her filming career if she has other aspirations to make other movies So far, filmmakers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in future production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions and compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "poisonous" and quite possibly could have a negative effect on sales of tickets to any film they are in. Sooooo .... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not wanted" ... will she be able to cope with this? I wonder if even Jay Leno wants to have Lindsay back on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All the above are just my OPINION. I do not have privileged information.
