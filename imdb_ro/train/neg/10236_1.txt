Absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now, before a legion of cinema purists blows in the latte, let me develop them. As I liked, this is simply one of the most serious movies I've ever seen and it's certainly the worst movie I've ever seen at the cinema (an impressive statement, as I remember that I saw Daredevil on the big screen). The two leaders (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were not convinced at best and even worse in the worst case. Of course, they were not helped by a scenario that had an emotional depth as great as a single Daphne & Celeste characterization that was as convincing as the JO defense. The plot (to stretch the easy term) was thin to nonexistent, and the "gore" scenes, no doubt brutal, were irrelevant and ridiculous forms. What plot is revolving around a twenty-year-old model (Cuthbert) who is kidnapped, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral, psychological and physical tortures. The scenes of torture resemble separate parts disconnected, and the emphasis was shocking, not scary. While there are really very few positives in this movie, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a terrible movie. I've never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. In fifteen minutes, the entire cinema was in seams, and it remained in that way. For my part, I came out of laughter, tainted by a movie that had climbed to the top of horrible movies. Regardless of how you look at it, it is truly a cinematic achievement and a plan for future directorial films detailing while not making a movie. I gave up mentioning that I was able to get into the movie ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I was tempted to ask my money back ... really It was bad.
