An illegal immigrant resists the social assistance system, causing direct consequences for many. Well filmed and acted even if the story is a little forced, yet the slow pace really starts the conclusion. The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively transmitted. The little man lost in big society is something we can relate to, but I can not say that I would not let you see this movie.
