If you hate the red accents, you will hate this movie. And to make it worse, you see Patrick Swayze, he tried to be a redhead. I really can not focus on red. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl? How much can you get this movie? The story was bad. Usually, I'm not the movie judge, but I can not resist this movie. If you want a good movie Billy Bob Thornton, go see Slingblade. My mother found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart ... figures ... I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my grandfather for Christmas. It might be that I can not stand redhead accents or I can not stand Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not in it. I did not laugh once in the movie. I usually laugh about something stupid. If he had shown that some of his fingers were crushed, I would have laughed. the fingers of the people that break down by chance always make me laugh.
