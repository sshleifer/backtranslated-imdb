I saw this last week after I took the cheap DVD. I wanted to see through the ages, finding the sketch of the park very interesting. So my disappointment was wonderful, to say at least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This type of play required Johnny Depp's performance in the Ninth Gate (about which is a complete rupture), but I think TV budgets do not always stretch to this type of ability to act. /> I also thought the direction was confusing and boring, just to remind me that Carpenter did not make a decent film since in the mood of madness. As for the story - I was also disappointed there too! There was no way I could meet my expectations, but I figured the salary and explanation was poor, and how she finally got the anticlimatic movie. one of the main contributors to AICN, and you can say he loves the cinema, but I would like a better result from such a good premise. I got the DVD back to the same day store!
