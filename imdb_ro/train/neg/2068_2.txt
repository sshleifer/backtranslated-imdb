The gospel of Lou was a great disappointment to me. I received an e-mail from the theater, showing it to be a wonderful and inspiring movie. It was neither great nor inspirational. The cinema was pretty confused with the whole movie. Many scenes were backs that were made in a way that could not sometimes say what it was. Voices were often distorted for no reason. Also, many of those who have been in the movie have been immersed. The relationship he has with his son is never clarified. Also, the whole movie has the most of a kind, then suddenly BAM is healed and inspires people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life as he lives, but when he changes, he does not leave the box, teaches others how to box. Thumb down.
