I frequently comment on the absolute dirt of the really scary films on the market and, unfortunately, the white noise served only to reduce my belief that the film industry remains capable of such an effort. I was surprised to find myself getting more and more tired as the story went on and the static-induced headache increased. I have found that White Noise is absurd beyond the best efforts to suspend mistrust. Even after we witnessed the wrong trial backed by Michael Keaton, we were totally unaffected by his death. Up to the credits I have been waiting for for something - something ... of substance to connect with the story of the characters, but there has never been such a relief. Sure, there were occasional heart-stopping moments, but only because strong noises tend to do this for the eager gaze. While the act was blades, Michael Keaton may have played his most studious role so far. Perhaps the only redemption quality that White Noise can offer is the amazing architecture of both Keaton's dwellings. On the whole, White Noise leaves one with the morbid idea of ​​a depressant that those who die die in a trapped world of three evil shadows, deceiving the living to follow the dead in their own graves.
