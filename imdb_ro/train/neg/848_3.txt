OK, If you are looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely a bad movie. I'm spinning around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, the greatest, is a doctor. This film is supposed to show the drop from reality to the extreme extremes the drugs make possible. However, no. This shows that cocaine can be fun regardless of the situation in which it happens to be present. Most of the film focuses on Max and his ways of separation. Eventually, Adam can not take the stress from the workplace and starts to use it (perscription drugs). This film has almost no climax. It does not descend into what you really do cocaine, it has tedious and low-budget scenes, and the action of Adam's biggest brother is horrible. I have no idea how this movie succeeded in passing and receiving awards, it's not a heart-wencher. If you want a clear and true story movie in the extreme world of drugs, if you do not buy "The Basketball Diaries". And notice the difference. Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will enjoy it. Try to see yourself ...
