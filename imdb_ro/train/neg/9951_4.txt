Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of a kind. The bottom of the neck, of course. They are dark and bitter creatures, with nothing to do but to spread their own misfortune. Through their charm (that is, a sharp tongue and a fat wallet respectively) seduce desperate souls, which they make to torment and victims. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. It's not a mixture of black humor I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine that the audience rooted in the main recklessness. I really liked the sound and the song of the quick remarks (and supposedly very nice). I was very impressed by the strong role of the cast, especially by David Thelis; only Jeremy's character seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and painful, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What truly reveals me about Naked (and the main reason I would never recommend to anyone) is how it seems to repeatedly present the misogynist as a valid way to avoid aggression. In other words, in a world that sucks so badly, what difference does it make if someone causes a pain on the girls? To suggest (as some have on this site) that Johnny is not so amazing a person because he is not as tough on girls as Jeremy, it seems absolutely absurd to me. They are both terrible and ugly. And I'm especially eager to hurt women every time they have a chance. One might argue that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his evil karma suddenly turned back and put it in the ass. Yet, the sadistic behavior of Jeremy and himself are treated to a certain extent as a laughing problem. And I might be wrong, but I think most people who absolutely love this movie also find this aspect of the dark comic movie.
