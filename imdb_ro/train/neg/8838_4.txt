Are there any similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest film "Lantana"? a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But while "Lantana" offered hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a gloomy way that will leave most viewers dissatisfied, maybe even cheated. The story - the discovery of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It has become an element of Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble, Short Cuts. Lawrence uses this theme for exploring and exposing relationships in a small Australian community under stress. The film puts some moral questions: "Would you let the discovery of a corpse ruin your good weekend?" and more careful for Australians "Would it be a difference if the dead man were an aboriginal?" The act, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike "Picnic at Hanging Rock". If all this sounds the basis for a great movie - be prepared for disappointment, the pace is very slow, and killing is shown near the beginning, thus eliminating the element of mystery. And so we are left with these lives deserted and with a black final.
