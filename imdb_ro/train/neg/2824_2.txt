I'm a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this movie. Haim, the drug that has now suffered drugs that abuse the 80s child is gentle as usual, and commenting back from minor characters / actors would be useless; I would not want to say that everyone was very accustomed. It's a great movie, like a journey down in the memory band in the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good pictures from the Colorado background and a very harmless, though the mind plot comforters. Overall, Do not waste your time watching this if you do not like 80's films, Corey Haim or, like me, I love the old Porsche school (especially it looks great) because life is too short to watch horror movies .
