I want to make a word "Holmes with Doors", but we can not get him together. Appropriately, beautified and edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that simultaneously channel Morrison .... but how is this movie about the famous 14 inches! The Australian crime movies are lit all the time and jumped on graphic violence ... ... as a famous person once said about the double standards of American cinema: "kisses a breast and is an X, a stab and a PG 13 action." WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long, and at the end of this spiral we were all glad to get out of the cinema. How many movies will we call WONDERLAND that we will get? There must be six in the last decade. Pixel violence and silent color make the scary tone, but the turbot becomes tedious as if we were to guide our nations all the time. Taking a few clues from the UCI and the TAXI DRIVER, everything becomes forgotten the next day.
