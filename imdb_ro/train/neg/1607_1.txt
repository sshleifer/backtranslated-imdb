This "documentary" is proof of talent that is used for medium purposes. The fact that it is financed by the Venezuelan government lacks legitimacy to seek the truth about what really happened in these horrific days in April 2002 in Venezuela, which even we Venezuelans do not know for sure. There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things lie both through omission and knowledge. <br /> <br /> Venice's political process is too complex to be easily understood by the foreign audience, and they take advantage of it. For example * POSSIBLE SPOILS * show pro-Chávez demonstrators shooting in an empty street (for what the hell did they do that?) In a way to say they do not kill anyone, but they did not bother to show the pictures that we all saw here, the opposition demonstrators (and a journalist) who fall dead or injured on the other side of that empty street. They can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one authorized to fly over Caracas that day, and did nothing against the snipers who were over the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, which would show how ineffective the measures were security to protect the president. A few days after the "coup d'état", the head of the responsible military guard was asked by the National Assembly (Congress) why they did not act against the snipers and said "because they were not there to act against the president" is not a confession ? Moreover, the fact that the high-ranking military announced that Chávez resigned and two days later said he lied because "that's politics" and today is Chávez's Minister of Internal Affairs. It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies described in this "documentary" made with the intention of selling the world to the image of old Hugo Chávez who governs the poor and the wicked of the rich opposition who want it at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject their government, and the percentage includes the poor. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see another version of a group of Venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
