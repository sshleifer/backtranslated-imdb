He's got a great name, but that's not going to get you more than that for your money; in fact, the first 30-40 minutes of the movie might find him some sort of funny, but then the story goes from a side to side with no special reason, and you just can not understand what happens until the action is gone. And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call them an actor, but I do not think the way they could have been shouting nothing but overtaking! The child playing the role of his son has no sense of acting and I think it was just a favor he did or something because he had no idea what he was doing. casting believed that by throwing comics they could do it, but they did not! and sometimes cheat cheap cheap so bad, do not buy it. But, hopefully, this is as bad as it gets. For people to accept those DVDs for the tasteful audience, they will have to offer some food to him that could be done. <br /> <br /> Maka
