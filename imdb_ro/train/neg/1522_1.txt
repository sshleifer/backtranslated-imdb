You should know that I am the type of person who follows even the worst movies to the end, often out of morbid curiosity. I really looked at Leprechaun to the end, before I tried to pull my eyes off and erase them. You also need to know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before making a frantic jump for the stop button and destroyed the rental shop just to put as much distance between me and as much as possible.
