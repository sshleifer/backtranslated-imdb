... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. A "remake" of the title, which removes each cliche from the spreadsheet. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely weak execution of all attempts of suspense or emotion. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that does not guarantee gore, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not frightening or even mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of so slim and stereotyped characters that we might not be interested in them. The lack of any really frightening atmosphere (much unlike Night Prom Night). <br /> <br /> 8. A dialogue script that is beyond the poor - is a comforting mind. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of card shows (I'm not sure whether to blame the actors or scenario mentioned above). <br /> <br /> 10. A completely seamless remake for adolescents, who is not brave enough to try to have an imagination - or even show a puddle of blood. He's a fan of mindless terror, save your money. /> <br /> BOMB of ****
