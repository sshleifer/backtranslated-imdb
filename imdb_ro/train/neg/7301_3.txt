There is a major difference between releasing an original, intentional, fearsome, frightening, gore-fest scriptwriter and making director Eli Roth and his team do it with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted like that. The film follows five college graduates in a forest cabin that begins to prove fatal as one after another succumbs to this mysterious, fast acting, meat-eating disease. Not long before friends come back to each other and can hardly stop each other, the less they want to be in the same area as they do. So rough, as it sounds, there is a certain spark behind the base premise of this film that could have worked in the hands of a less faithful film producer. Unfortunately, what we have to do with poorly drawn characters whose only purpose seems to be beautiful at first in order to make the inconsistent, more inconsistent decomposition, a dreaded scenario so loaded by profanity that it lets the spectator adjust the dialogue and more incomprehensible subplots that motivate less than (in one instance) a screening of director Roth. This is a puzzled video in many ways! Avoid this devouring time.
