James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a "mental facility" for a medical stay with Dr. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, she realizes that many inmates are killed by "The Ripper," who takes his souls to the devil, in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort. This story is so absurd and stupid that it is impossible to write a summary. Dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when the character of Helen, James Bishop's fiancé blonde gets to the asylum, that it is almost unbelievable that a writer had the courage to include them in a script. And what happens to James's return to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And the cast, made up of actors and actresses? Frankly, I do not know what or the worst in this movie: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is certainly all. I have seen this movie on cable television and am amazed how a producer can spend money in such a garbage. This horror movie becomes very funny, given the absurd plot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Demônio' (`Devil ')
