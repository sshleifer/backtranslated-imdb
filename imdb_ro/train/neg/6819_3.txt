In this movie, joe pesci slams a basketball. joe pesci ... and being consistent, the rest of the scenario is not as credible. pesci is a funny guy who saves this movie from the absolute sinking behind the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who appreciated more money than people, which was not even played well. instead of the man who was an archetypal villain, he seemed rather an orroid programmed to make money at any cost. then there is the token piece that is attributed to the fish as a girlfriend or something ... I do not even remember ... it was that forgetful. anyone who misses this movie over 5 or 6 is a paid member of a movie studio trying to gain the reputation of this immersed film or at least one of those millions of mediaists who can not critically effectively (you know, people who feel wicked if I give anything you mark under 6) <br /> <br /> stay away ... away. and ashamed of the central comedy where I saw this movie. I usually choose better.
