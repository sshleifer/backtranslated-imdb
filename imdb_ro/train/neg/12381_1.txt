This movie is really evil. She plays in the urban paranoia of the 70/80s and puts it in a school context. I'm not saying that urban crime was not a problem for a lot of people or that schools were not / are not problematic areas, but this piece of poor exploitation takes biscuit. Violence is beyond anything imaginable, but in this case it is not a case of social problems, but a middle-class white high school student uses it to become the crypt of local crime. And, of course, he knows how to play the system. Sounds familiar. Yes. This flock is a violent pure exploitation, a truly ugly work. It is a disturbing brutality dressed as a social commentary. It belongs in the same category as trash as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on, and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broken when he had to do such things.
