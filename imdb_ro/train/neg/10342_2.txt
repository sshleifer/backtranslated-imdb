Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most incredibly young of John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's path revolves uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks he is the first and his performance in itself, in a minor role, underlines the total lack of balance and chemistry among the filmmakers. Normally, I do not like to let myself try so much, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books over time and to watch what they've done with me makes me crazy.
