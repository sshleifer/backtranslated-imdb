We did not have real expectations in this movie and I'm glad. Even if I expected to be ill, I would have been disappointed. Where should I begin? First of all, I think 15% of the movie was shooting stunts in a dark jungle field. I see. They're scared. I think the title of "Scarecrows" was enough. Secondly, it is not a cursed thing ever explained in terms of scarecrows and paranormal appearance. Is there too many times I was allowed to go WTF? Third, the movie takes seriously. They're all for a B movie with blood buckets, screaming women and meaningless violence that's the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But those movies often know that they are B movies and even make it sing like Dead Snow or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems to not forget about crapdom. there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said. If you have a horror movie, do it with the killing. And if you have a hot girl and a semi-hot girl, one of them should show how little the boob. So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrow" and just keep an eye on yourself. You'll thank me.
