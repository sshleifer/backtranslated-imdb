Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for SEALs because of her appearance. It was a bad start and the movie came down from there. The land was totally unbelievable. The will to do so in a difficult military unit is not enough. This film does not convince me of the physical capacity of a woman to perform the necessary tasks. The attempt to claim that women and men are essentially the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. Gender differences represent what makes life interesting.
