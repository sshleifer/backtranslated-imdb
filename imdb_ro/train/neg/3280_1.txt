I wont go and give them my $ 10 I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children enjoy it and they can look at it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather look at the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy, in fact she thinks she looks more like a whore than a daisy duke. Those shorts may not wear anything at all. And since she's American Pie has something to do with Dukes SHAME on them because she put that ugly line there to have sex with a car. The only thing that should come out of this is a film of reunion with the originals. Let's hope. So the people there who went and saw the movie will see how they should have looked
