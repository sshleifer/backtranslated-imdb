Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say anyway, I would prefer to look at the dry paint) still sucks. Do a favor and avoid something from these boys at Low Budget Pictures. I'm upset to buy some DVDs to support some indie movies and I regret it. Some have not even been officially "released" (not bootleg-bought by filmmakers) and I can not even tell how bad they are all. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them, as they pop in other small indy movies they're friends with. If you are friends of these guys, you are likely to be in their movies and have fun doing them. But for those who had to look at them? No way. Bad video, bad audio, evil acting, evil plot ... etc etc These are not even funny. I gave this 2 just because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's about it. Maybe it does not deserve even 2. About a star of 1/16 to show that it was a bit better than the first one (which I would like to have evaluated in the negative). If you want a decent budget movie, take something from LBP "friends" to "Freak Productions" like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. They are actually decent.
