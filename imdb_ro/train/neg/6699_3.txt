"Algie, Miner" is a silent and unpleasant comedy. The fill time is completely stopped. This is a kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if it should be fun or not. However, the real quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a mandatory watch for movie lovers, mainly because one of the first examples of gay cinema. Algie's main character is an effeminate type who behaves the same as the "pansy" common stereotype in many early movies. The film has the common homophobic attitude of time. "Algie, Miner" is quite terrible but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
