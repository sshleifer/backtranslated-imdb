First of all, this movie is not a "thriller." Nor is it "tight, tense". It may have been so based on the scenario, but the slow pace of the direction makes it difficult to enter. This very plot is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only have an ingenious feeling after the image is over. This leaves us with more than two hours of long sequences, with music playing over them, dotted with some action scenes that do not grab the spectator, and scenes "cunning vixen" that inject a little clearer intelligence. <br /> <br /> I would have wanted to have been the thriller with the fast paced rhythm of the box. It would have been an extraordinary movie. Instead, Spike Lee made her come to an end.
