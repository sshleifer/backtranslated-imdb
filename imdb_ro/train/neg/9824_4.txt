I was familiar with television American, when I came across this on cables my first I thought it was just a sci sci-fi, then after a few minutes I began to think it might be a clever satire on the most extreme excesses of the Christian fundamentalist, and then I realized - a good pain, these people are serious! It's been a while since I've seen something so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated to write a review of this because of the fear of believers, but I also saw other reviews and I thought, hey, I can take it. Strong philosophical noise: how do you make a movie that criticizes movies without really showing what you're criticizing? Answer: do it so that the only people who will appreciate it are those who hate the kind of criticism. I suppose some liberals might be offended by the contempt filming the audience who are not obsessed with the myth J **** C *****, but I do not mind - it was so funny!
