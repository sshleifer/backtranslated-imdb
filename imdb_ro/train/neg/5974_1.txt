Let me begin by saying that this does not seem or resemble a movie. It looks like just another television show about girls and boys, without real movie language, backs it up. The camera angles are so straight that the story is spoken in the easiest way possible not to let the audience connect with it. This movie takes us where no movie I've ever seen has ever made me: in a land where the Theater Theater becomes a warm environment, giving the audience all the elements of interpretation. Too obvious. The big film screen is used only as an expanded television, where we can see each attribute of these women in a greater way than life. Lately, it seems that young directors compromise the art of sales for the movie. This is very scary. Industry destroys art in movies. We need to educate ourselves and our children about what they really mean about cinema and language. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch platform for young divasi and jocks.
