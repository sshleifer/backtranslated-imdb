Coyote Ugly could have been more effective if movie makers made a guilty film / guilty exploit (with a lot of nudity). But since the PG-13 is what all studios want today, we end up with a movie like that: a PG-13 movie that is not allowed to go anywhere near the end of the movie. The scenario is generic to guess which parcel point will take place 15 minutes before it actually happens. The act is appropriate, but the characters are so thin that nothing can be done with them. There were also a lot of points where it seemed that I was watching a video-video, rather than a movie. The only assets of the film are amazingly beautiful female lead. We can see them in some very strict and fairly revealing kits ..... but only so much could be shown due to the PG-13 constraints. There are lots of cleansing and toning that make bodies that give some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there is no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (she continues to become even more beautiful with greatness with age) is also in the film for a very short time. Piper Perabo, the sexy newborn, is also very easy for the eyes (and has a killer smile) and has an authentic potential to act. The only people I could see in this movie are the pre-puberty boys who are not allowed to watch R-rated movies. This audience could get a lot of it out of a titillation aspect, but the adult audience will feel upset and cheated. Rating: movie-1 women-10
