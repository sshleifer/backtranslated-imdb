This movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I have given up this, I feel better. This movie is weak from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is very bad. Freddy is the worst cartoon person. Thank God they killed him. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos? The only good thing in the movie is a bit of backstory that we're given to Freddy. We see he once had a family and saw his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). Besides, it's all bad. There are some quality actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do everything they can, but the end result is just that bad. An hour and a half we spent watching this movie and can not return for an hour and a half.
