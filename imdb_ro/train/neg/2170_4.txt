This film brightens the fine line between satire and silly. While a deck system that has no rules can promote marriage harmony, it certainly can not promote the winning bridge, so satire did not go for me. But there were some things I found pleasant anyway, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the movie. It's treated like a boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest defeated in a square area such as a boxing ring, there is a referee who feeds among competitors, and the broadcaster Roscoe Karns offers a nonstop conversation about happenings. At one point, he lists even "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if a four diamond offer was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for everything, a common event for boxing matches in the championship. This spoof really worked really well. Unfortunately, few of the actors offer the comedy necessary to support the desired satire. Paul Lukas does not have too much flair for comedy and is mischievous; the wonderful Loretta Young and the regular comic Frank McHugh did not get good lines; Glenda Farrell has a comic twist as a blonde at the start of the movie, but basically disappears afterwards. What a loss of talent!
