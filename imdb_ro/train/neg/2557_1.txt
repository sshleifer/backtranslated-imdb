Actually, I like asylum films. I made it a habit to see as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they did were cold as EXORCISM AND WHEN USING a murderer. This is simply blades. I can not believe the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA CURSES even made this movie! It's not as bad as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way, is bad enough). This is just stupid! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive special bad effects or special blades in an asylum film, but this movie is taken too seriously. I really hope SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now it's a movie I can not wait to see him.
