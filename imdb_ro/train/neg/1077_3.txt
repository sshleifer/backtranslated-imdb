Have you ever heard that people "telegrap their intentions?" Well, in this movie, the characters' actions do more than the future telegraph plans - they appear at home, drunk and owl about your head. This could be forgiven if the setting was better used or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, but only from wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the charm that his character has probably been written to have. Bottom line: obvious plot, one-song performances, inappropriate characters and "southern" grotesque accents used by British actors.
