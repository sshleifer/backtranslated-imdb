An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse, which seems to be blamed. He becomes stung by it, or bitten by something on it. It gets sick quickly, and a white, spooky white larva of a kind spits at the hospital. A subsequent attempt to resuscitate it with oars causes a drop of blood. A policeman is at the hospital because his partner was hurt badly in a shot. In a way, the cop is associated with one of the female doctors as well as an entomologist who is brought. There are several young children who are wandering in the hospital, of whom I suppose we should find adorable, but who are very annoying brats. It's going to get lost in the room where the specimen is kept and it's going to throw a growth hormone on it. The horror movie would say it deserves to die for it, but I'm never in danger. The creature grows and begins to reproduce. People run away from her, and sometimes to her for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by soldiers who are ready to destroy everything if needed. There are really persuasive characters in the movie and most often it seems that people are looking around for the monster. It was pretty boring. Obviously, it is due to some foreign movies, with a monster that is born inside a man and has several stages of growth. There is also a character called Bishop, and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
