First of all, the big actors called must have money ... Surgical scenes were ridiculous ... and certainly must know that people who have little knowledge of medicine would find this absolutely absurd ...... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant .... nor do the surgery in a tiny room without instruments, equipment of cardiac lungs and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not focus on the line of the story because of all the stupid surgical scenes ... without blood, no staff, and then the protagonist of the hero who comes in and takes over ... it's not a movie for adult thinking ... Also the budget must have been limited ... the scenes the street was ok but who was the technical adviser .... It seems he was directed by a total idiot .. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and do not rent it ..
