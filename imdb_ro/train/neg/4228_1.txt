I can not believe how bad this trash is! I want to get back $ 3.99 back! The words defy the description of this badly made piece! Doubling in any form or shape is not aligned with the actor's mouth. The film shows that it was filmed with a 1970s room. I filmed better movies with my cell phone. Gore is ridiculous because of incredible incredible plot. The actor is what you would expect if you called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and you started to have fun, then you tried to play in the garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neil and I like Zombie movies, but production values ​​are so low in this movie that they make it unbearable. Avoid!
