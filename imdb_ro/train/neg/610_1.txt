I bought this movie at a cheap price in a sale after reading the back of the DVD box and assuming I can not even lose it if it was garbage then there was no loss, if it was ok then the deal Then I looked at her ... Normally, I'm a fan of Christopher Walken, but in this movie he commanded the very low presence of the screen, it does not seem to make a the whole, even the death of his immediate friend, which sparks the "action" of the plot, seems to affect him very little, and his revenge is just boring and non-racist. Normally, a film that has grand themes like revolution and revenge is able to surprise the audience and get them stuck to feel something for the characters, although seeing this movie rather feels a series of confusing and close events Randomly linking together to his end ... At this moment I cried ... I thought this movie was the most horrible pain of watching I came subjected, the scene in which the pilot sacrificed by refusing to jump off the truck loaded with explosion because he did not want to kill any civilian, is not so tragically sad that it is unpleasantly horrible and painful, though not as bad as emergency surgery to the injured girl. The act was weak throughout the year, the script and story were weak, "action" was even weaker, and "visual" was not just visual. To summarize, there are movies that are good, movies that are bad, movies that are so bad that they are good, movies that are terrible ... And then to a whole new level is "McBain"
