Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about this movie must receive royalties. This is a horrible movie in every respect. Imagine that high school students have no money and no sense of humor by making a video of slasher / comedy. He would get a D for that. Children's colleges would receive an F or have asked to leave school. Since this monstrosity has been made by "Professionals," I think there should be a time of imprisonment or at least cinematographic evidence. I like to watch bad movies Like "Plan 9 in outer space," but this does not fall into this category. The scenario, drive, sound, and direction are so bad that it is virtually undiscovered. If you love watching bad movies that are fun with Ed Wood, blaxploitation or horror films in the 1970s. Once you see this, you will feel that you have lost an hour and a half of your life.
