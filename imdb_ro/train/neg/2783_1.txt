I made a visit to one of my relatives a while ago and I came to a theater, so I thought we would come in and we will give this movie. What a mistake! This movie is terrible in every department. I have never heard of the movie and literally everyone has no more. No wonder he's as good as he is. It's a comedy, so it is said, but the only fun thing about it is the ability or lack of it from the director to make such a movie. How close to Christmas, this should be called how to cook a turkey in about an hour and a half - or how long it was when I left. At the end of the movie, you will feel like you have been poisoned with food on a sick turkey and regret that you have lost time on such a dribble. Who knows why such things are done. Some people left the theater before the movie ended and I blame myself because I did not leave much earlier. It really annoys me that you are paying good money to see something decent and everything you go out and see is a bad TV movie that should be shown at 2am in the morning it's really so bad should not show it . What else can he say ... there are probably not enough bad words that could be right.
