The reason he saw her in the movie was that it was a preview of sneak, otherwise I would not have seen this terrible teenage film. I mean, I did not have enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them seriously! Crying is smart, and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only film that competes to be the worst I've seen in the cinema with it.) There are so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so similar that he has not died even now and who has not died. (and you do not care.) The only one I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the most talented little actress I've ever seen in this bad apology for a movie. away from this possible movie. (2/10)
