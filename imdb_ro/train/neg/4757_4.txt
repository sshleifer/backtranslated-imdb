Some time ago, I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine has returned, but now is his husband and Jude Law, his wife's lover. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic piece. During the movie I always had the feeling of watching a song. This is one of the reasons why I do not like this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted for a piece, I have to feel another film and not just a piece. Director Kenneth Brannigan made some wonderful movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the film's look. The design was modern, elegant, clean, inconvenient and cold. I never felt that someone ever lived in that house. The photo was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes it was a blue light, dark light, green to round it, not friendly to the eye. The actor was very good. Michael Caine and Jude Law have the best performances. I really want to see these two guys playing together on the stage. But I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that, in the original, this part was still very mysterious and wonderful. I tried to look at her twice and always in the middle I felt asleep. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more a movie for critics than for the public. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
