When I was watching this movie I thought, well it would be good anytime ... I was wrong. The best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete loss of 92 minutes. All the seriousness was the best part when Wendigo finally appeared, which was at the end and you could not even see it so well. And the end of the tail was really bad. There were too many sections in the movie that you thought something was going to happen, but it was a disappointment. The worse part is that there is more talk about Wendigo, then it was Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you certainly could not tell it through this movie.
