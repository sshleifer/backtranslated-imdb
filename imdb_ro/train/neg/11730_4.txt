Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) returns; this time he is after "Night Strangler". Once again, police officers and fellow journalists do not believe or want to hide the supernatural angle. Director-designer Dan Curtis presents the same basic story with the previous "Night", with a more understandable success. <br /> <br /> Curtis assembles a fun support distribution including "Dark Shadows" graduates George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) leads a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I have never seen him here, Roger Davis has to accompany Mr. McGavin's dinner table in an early stage, pretending to be mistrustful of vampires! <br /> <br /> The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
