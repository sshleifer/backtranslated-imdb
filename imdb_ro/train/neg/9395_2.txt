This series is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature, but for today's audience it's all it is. I was really surprised to see the year he was made in 1952. Considering that only this makes this solid (weak?) 2 in my book. The used cars do not look even contemporary, they look like things in the 1930s. Is it Cody (salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh speaks of an insult to everyone else, like the soldiers), anyway Cody is in his nipple ring that flew against Graber and Daley, the two bastards who had sport guns and a fairly occasional beam of lashes in itself, enjoy yourself. If you want to look at a very good serial, you see Flash Gordan, it's full of missiles that attack one another and a bad bad nemesis and also beautiful women, that has nothing of it. And Flash was done 15 years before these crap, so you can give it a little. Something done in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. Nuff said. give it a 6 if you look at it as an MST3K episode, those guys are having a good time with it; a tweak of nipples here, a tweak there and I fly! And now, as an extra bonus, I'm bringing you the song Commander Cody Theme as originally played by Joel and the two Tom Servo and Crow Robots on board the love satellite for Episode 8 The Enemy Planet: <br /> < > Singing from the beginning of the credits; <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) THE COMMANDER OF THE CURRENT CODING ...

WHEN BENI PEOPLE WIN, WIN ALWAYS STILL COPILIZED. .. and CODY MUST FIX it, he drinks his tea at his cafes ... and floats on fire, he beats cROOKS and FLIES with his fingers. .. and borrow the forest fires, <br /> <br /> (CROW SINGING) <br /> <br /> BAD GUYS FOLLOW ... CODY IS IS THERE Like <br /> <br /> Like Hair is under him HELMUT ... AND IF YOU DO NOT PLEASE TO PRAY A GOOD RIM, WHICH IS THE END OF COMMANDER CODY THEME SONG ... SO HOW TO RIGHT WITH A VIEW OF GRANITE, <br /> <br /> <br /> AND SEE CHAPTER Eight, CAUSES THE ENEMY PLANET
