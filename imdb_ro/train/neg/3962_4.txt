I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir's stunning debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I read that Nana was generally considered the best silent film, so I had great hopes. Unfortunately this was a huge step back. Catherine Hessling is the main issue with this movie. Her actress is above, even for a silent film. Her act is more like what she would expect in a movie from early teens, not at the end of the 20's. She usually has the same face that reminds me (I'm sorry to say) about someone with constipation pain. It was also very hard to believe that any man would fall for this fatal female. There was nothing charming about her. The film was also long drawn, working with the camera was uninteresting (except for a horse racing hit) and the editing was boring. The story reminded me of Pandora's Pablo Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only three years between these films. Panda's Panda simply scores at each level where Nana fails. This movie is just for Renoir completists or very serious silent buffs movies.
