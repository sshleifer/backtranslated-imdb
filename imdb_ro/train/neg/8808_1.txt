"ASTONISHING" Scream LA Times at the front of the DVD box. Perhaps it refers to the fact that a piece of bad shit has ever been released. The film revolves around a group of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals and kill innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin moves along the film, we also see cut legs, heads, etc. that are as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There is a bunch of kitchen talk, a little human kitchen, and a strange freak clown hunter who imprison those who suffer from the skin disease mentioned in the cabinet attached to a chair before killing them in their heads in bits ... <br /> <br /> Get the picture. Considering that there is not a talent to act, and the gorillas are ridiculously unrealistic, what is the purpose of this whole farrago? Again, looking at the video tape, the guy wearing it is a "underground worship director". Would it be like those strange religious cults in which you brainwash your brain to think in a way that clearly the opposite is true? Because this is the only reason I can think of for anyone to enjoy the pursuit of this tax exemption. Then in the same paragraph compare to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. Hahahahaha oh stop it. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of that cult. Are they paying your salaries? Do you allow to see other family members? Does it force you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director of A.Hitchcock? Say ... it sounds like a Special Panorama specialty for me. And to greet LA critics when you come back to your colony, do not you? 0/10
