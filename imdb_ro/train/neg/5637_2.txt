I understand that I want to make a movie that is nervous and different. I understand the reviewer's previous comments that this is a wanted movie. My point is that as soon as this movie ended my first comment was: "This happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and she does not have the talent" ... she uses her father's money to make a movie on who wrote it, directs and pays for ..... obviously to close the movie to realize that there is no character development and no direction like a start, middle and end ..... the part the voyeur was good and nervous but what was the point? I saw a woman going to a house, finding some pictures, limping the caregiver, going out on a very cold night (not credible) to check the noise and get over his beloved caretaker .... the movie is over. .... does anything educate my ignorant burn? I really want to know what is the point ... what was the vision of directors ..... why no development loved dead? Why is there no background for the caretaker? What is the purpose of night vision? What is the lipstick for the car? Why a caregiver dead? Why tell us about a liar / peeping patient he escaped? What about the urn? Oh, and the lamp is supposed to mean "whose home is? Territorial? Why? Why would he care for his house? This aspect has never been pursued ... As for William Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was in him and known for the exaggerated characters ..... write back and tell me what I need to learn .. .. I'm just a middle-aged mother who loves movies ... Chris ... .
