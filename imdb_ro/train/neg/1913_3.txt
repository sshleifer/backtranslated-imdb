"Welcome to Collinwood" is a disaster. Taking into account the people involved, it should have been several times better. Seeing it, if you are at least tied to the belief that it will be better, it will probably make you cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks for a terrible scenario and a bad action, not to mention the strange and useless strange character George Clooney and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss, but I care so little that I do not even want to know her name. The only salvation of the film is the weird con- vocabulary it introduces. I woke up thinking from time to time and saw more murders. That's the only reason I gave it to movie 3. A plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessary offensive and extremely impressive. I am in a constant state of agonizing stress and are so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They scream at each other and swear loudly. Dialogue is insipid at best and stupid insult at its low points. I think Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for that. They should be judged for war crimes if someone really remembers this long enough shit to take care of.
