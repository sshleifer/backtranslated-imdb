An interesting story about a soldier in a war that fails to save the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he has saved many other captive children. The film lights up a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher who is mostly led by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison and most children do not pay too much attention to their teachers or their manager. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides to give up teaching and will enter another field. However, the director asks him to have a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. It's at this moment in the movie, when all hell breaks off and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you have decided to view it!
