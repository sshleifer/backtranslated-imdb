I was one of those "little Americans" who grew up with all the wonderful creations of Gerry Andersen. Thunderbirds has been a great deal of time and would have made a great action / adventure film if only writers could figure out where to target it. I expected to be a romp, but I did not expect it to target such a low age group. Just as lost in space, this could have been amazing and visually visible. It should have focused on more action / adventure and the purpose of the original series ... saving people in trouble. Instead, he focused on saving Alan instead of his young brothers versus the original one). The breakout was Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not care much about the original characters, but I was grateful to them for the film. They stole the show! I've always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for high-tech than stories, and even that did not have enough screen time for me. I would have liked to see more cool gadgets. But then, I'm just a big kid ...;)
