Why a woman can not be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man? The campaign manager in this film dreams to lead Tom Sellick to the White House. All you can think of. So why should you have an affair with him on the ground? He added nothing to the plot and served only to denounce successful women. The only value of that game was the love of "I slept with your husband". <br /> <br /> Also, could not the people who made this film have followed the national conventions they falsified? The airing between the two major political conventions served only to highlight their total ignorance over the process of appointment and selection.
