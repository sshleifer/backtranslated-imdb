Is there anything worse than a comedy movie that does not have humor? The answer is yes; one that does not generate any interest in the whole image. The premise is not too bad - a naive person on the front for an illegal business - but this is a casino with a bad scenario and scenario and it does not work. Was this considered a good "B" in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the film is the representative, which contains many well known faces from the 1930s and 1940s, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett, and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weak who killed him Gary Cooper in The Lives of a Bengal Lancer, so I did not count it). You can not recommend this and have a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, you get a root channel.
