I'll master the plot, Alice, after surviving the previous Nightmare series, finds Freddy Krueger's dead dreams that start again. This time the stabbing killer breaks the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but maybe Alice can free her spirit in time to save her own son? This movie started very well as we see Alice dreaming about being Amanda Kruger who gets stuck in the room and is raped by 100 maniacs, then she is urgent at the hospital but she is no longer pregnant, but then she gives birth to Freddy . Alice and Dan are the only two people who return from the fourth film and then become new friends shortly before Freddy starts killing again, I liked first, not as well as other deaths or dreams. Freddy himself did not seem to be scary in this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring really were not scary or creepy at all. /> <br /> Action in the movies was good for a five-part film in the series, but generally I think this movie was really Dull. (Still not the worst of the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) 4/10
