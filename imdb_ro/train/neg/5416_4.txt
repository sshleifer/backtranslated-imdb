This was von Stroheim's third effort - it's pretty brutal and it does not show any kind of exceptional flair for the camera and editing master that he would display a few years later with his masterpieces, GREED and MARRIAGE OF WEDDINGS. In essence, we have a trio of pussy who behaves like a Russian challenger and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money at the tables and win a fortune. Part of this plan is for the count (von Stroheim) to insinuate between an American ambassador who visits his crazy wife, to beat him and say he hopes to win some money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of taking the maid's life savings, which he promised to marry. When she sees them together, she lights the room, (von Stroheim and his booty are on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroheim first sets himself up as the "man you love to hate". He is very sorry, and his defects ultimately bring him to a very bad and deserving end. The movie is brutal in cinema and editing and is not worth watching unless you are fascinated by the director. There is a bit of a nice thing - when he first tries to meet the ambassador's wife, read a book - we see the title - Wools Wools by Erich von Stroheim. It was originally imagined as a 210-minute film, cut at 140 minutes of the studio and eventually released at 70 minutes. Restoring on Kino Video restores the surviving movie (somewhat damaged in most scenes) by the previous alternative version to give us a 107-minute print.
