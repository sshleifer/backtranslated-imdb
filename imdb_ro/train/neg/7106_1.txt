I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I've seen only a handful of them (and none of "Halloween" or "thirteenth Friday") - but I can appreciate a dreadful horror film not because of the gore. And I'm pretty sure this is not scary. What's so scary for a small plastic skull that appears everywhere? In all his appearances there are long-distance shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this movie. (Not that a skull itself is frightening anyway, but ...) The complaint relates to Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson) who marries a Donna-reed look (Peggey Webber, which gives one of the worst performances ever), who begins to see the skulls and hear the mysterious crypts of a group of peacocks on his husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? Ooooh !!!! Wonder who did it! This is the same old plot about a rich boy who tries to kill him and / or lead his crazy wife. If you want to see a well-done version of these things, try "Reversing luck". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. MSTing was fine, but nothing special; associated with "Gumby" short, however, it does for good viewing. Two stars for Screaming Skull; eight stars for the MST3K version. And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
