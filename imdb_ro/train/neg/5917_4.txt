This film wants to work out that criminals are a product of modern society. Therefore, the thieves, rapists and murderers (The Killer of this film, Carl Panzram (James Woods), are all three and worse) can be fully responsible for their deeds? An interesting but very difficult notion to bring on the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfactory way. And here's where Killer: A crime journal falls very short. Although the film tries to put Panzram's behavior into practice, with retrospectives of younger violence and dysfunctional education, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is more of a victim than a guilty one. Of course, the system is corrupted, with a mobster occupying the entire Leavenworth prisoner (where most of the movie is taking place), most of the guards are sadistic beatings, and the director of the prison is a megalomaniac despot. But why on earth the new prison guard, Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard), is so pitying for Panzram? Even after reading his terrible journals? The film provides an explanation: The small Panzram witnesses being beaten by the most sadic (and stereotypical) guardian and impressed by Panzram's intelligence (although it is not clear why Malul believes this man is so intelligent). Surely this is not enough to feel a hostile man like Panzram, even if this film tends to undermine its crimes and highlight its personality? To the sinners, Panzram is quite loyal and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser it goes beyond all the atrocities he has read in Panzram's journals. Does this Lesser man have so few friends that he takes over all those who seem to be just friendly to him? Perhaps it is Lesser, which is a product of modern society, judging by appearance rather than substance. I can advise Monster, Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a film that deals about the same topics with much more integrity and scope. BTW: The killer looks like he was shot for television (not so good)
