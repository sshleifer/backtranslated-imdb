I like horror movies, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. But how can anyone think it's a great horror movie? compare it to titles in a vein-like movie. haunting, change, shine. or for a similar technology-based horror movie that has been FAAAR better, (although still far from the sea) Demon Seeds. Okay, I'll be right ... compare her to horror films made for television! you do not go to sleep .. waaay creepier and better done. Salem's batch, night watch, night galley, even if you did not go to the basement or the wind farm were much better. * SPOILERS * First, for a scene as good as the bloody blood scenery, you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! the garden hose comes alive to storm terrifying teenagers! TERRIBLE. also what we understand about the house ... it seems they have to use their camcorders to see what's going on and it's a very emotional house. not a spirit, a demon or an entity, is a house that is "possessed," but by what? are we led to believe that an inanimate object has learned to love suzie / daisy, our protagonist? now that I'm on the suze subject .. another scene that totally disturbed me, this old crazy old lady comes in, tells you she's your nurse, pours her heart, falls into the hot pool, fights agony for 45 seconds, and what does the daisy make? are they risking their hands burned to save this poor woman who came there to warn her life? no, sit there and look! acting for the most part was better than average for a horror movie, but here's the end of the positions. for at least one more exciting and fun horror movie about an inanimate object that kills death-watching people: the bed that eats. I have a feeling that the people who have appreciated this so high, whether they have not seen it since they first broadcast, or that they remind them that they scare them as children. this movie was rather worth less.
