I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send each copy of this film to Iraq and make them look. I even tried to take a blind woman to follow this and shut it up in 20 minutes. Did Adam Sandler fail to find a better project than this one? As for writing, if that's what you mean, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell! I think somewhere I read that the budget for this movie was 10,000 dollars and there was a lot less. Wallmart did a good deal in this respect? Each store has a big bucket on the floor for sale. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster, or you can sell it to a friend, but then it may not be your friend anymore!
