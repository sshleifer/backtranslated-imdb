The battle scenes were wonderful. I love the old and new cilons and how they painted the ones on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed that it was earth, but 150 years ago. But to travel so to start over? Are you kidding me? 38 people who fought for their existence and once they get to paradise, abandon the technology? No way. Sure he eats paper and nourishes food, but it's over. They can live again like humans. They just have a good doctor. What will they do when someone has a dental pain without wanting birth ... yes. Nobody would have made this choice.
