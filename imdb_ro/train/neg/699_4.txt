Probably one of the brightest slash films ever, badly acting and badly written. PLOT Five students stay behind during the holidays closing a bedroom, but someone has drawings and patterns on them and begins to kill one by one, the main suspect is the creepy land John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or it could be one of the five characters. ACTING It's not so bad that it's not that big, except for Daphne Zungia who dies too fast and should have been the main heroine, and the rest quite boring, though Laura Lapinski, the main heroine, sometimes has her charm and you feel sorry for her in the end. KILLS We can not really see why they forbid it, the killing looks rather false, a guy has a half-cut hand that looks very false, but the others are pretty ugly as a girl gets her head broken by a car, iron in life and another is burned alive. GENERALITIES It's not really a big slasher cou It was much better
