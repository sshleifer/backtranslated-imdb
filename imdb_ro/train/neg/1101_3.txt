This false journey never approaches the match of the spirit and madness of the excellent adventure these boys have in their first film. This tranche tries to get away from the prequel to catch new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and travels nowhere interesting or funny. There is almost half an hour left to show the guys performing a rock concert (and many people watching "free television" - when does this happen?) Certainly the screenwriter could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first film were tied together by convergence to the scientific presentation. Not in this film, which has pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke is over. Grim Reaper is blended for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, gets weak and has no spark for comedy or audience involvement. There is a ZZ Top impression, hammering for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. Forget this false.
