Now, look, I will not lie to you, but I got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because Danni Filth, the soloist of the band's increasingly popular death metal band, "Cradle Of Filth", has been. I have, of course, expected violence and the highest level, because Mr Filth can be portrayed as a plot. But dear god, I was so bad. This movie is serious, great time. Being a low budget movie (haha, wait, do this ZERO BUDGET), this obviously does not take into account the Howard Stern musical scores and the special effects of Spielberg. No, everything is a room, bad angles and bad blood scenes. Take, for example, when our star and our violent son, Mr Filth, violently kills a madman. She grabs her neck and the blood spits, but oh, it seems to me that there's a pack of juice filled with fake blood in the man's shirt. For you fans of Cradle Of Filth: You will hear two songs along the movie, but with room angles and inappropriate shooting, they get the general pleasure of the song DOWN. My final comment: Get away from him. It's blood, gore, breasts and hey, even a storied story. So if you like horrible violence, close to voices (yes, there are no words in this movie), then, by all means, buy it. But if unwanted movies are not yours, then avoid them. Do not lose your money.
