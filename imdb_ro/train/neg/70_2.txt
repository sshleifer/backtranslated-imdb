This movie never reached the theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should have listened to the critics and get over it. Despite the excellent range of actors, the film was very disappointing. Now I see why she went straight to the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought Bloom, Ledger, and Rush might have some value. They all did a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film moved slowly and never drew me. I did not manage to develop too much empathy for the characters and I had to fight the need to move forward quickly only to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking of renting it for "eye candy" purposes only. He will not even satisfy that.
