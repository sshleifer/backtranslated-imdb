Okay, first of all, I'm a huge zombie movie fan. I enjoyed all of Romero's films and I enjoyed the re-making of the Dead's Day. So when I heard every critic shooting this movie, I was still optimistic. I mean, the critics hated Resident Evil and, although it could not be a great movie, I was glad if not because it was a fun zombie that fired it with a decent half plot . However, it is pure nonsense. The terrible dialogue, the half-ass scenario and the video game scenes introduced into the movie. Who, in their right mind, thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the free term) that I liked was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws the originality out of the window, you can see in his show that he knows he is in a terrible movie of God and that he can do all that is best in him. All others behave like Shakespeare does. And I could add very badly. Basically, the only reason someone should see this monstrosity is if you are a.) I'm a huge zombie and you have to see every zombie shot made or b.) To play MST3K, the home game. See it with your friends and be ready for countless unintentional laughs. <br /> <br />
