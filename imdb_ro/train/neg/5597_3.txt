I'll say at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The action is mostly not good (I think only Sky has shown any promise) and you feel weird looking at it. All scenes that should make sense are really superficial, like when Ng comes out to her parents. There are many details, such as the kanji tattoo on Sky's shoulder, the fridge's girls magnets, and the terrible setting of the gods on sets ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point: "I'm gay, not horn." And I do not know. Even the comment is terrible, I stopped it after Ng talks about how weird it was to play a lesbian.
