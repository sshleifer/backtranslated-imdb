I've heard of this movie for many years and finally I had the opportunity to see it. A massive killing of the butchers in 1963 and 1969 eventually caused a cheerleader camp to close. Prior to 1982, Bambi, a former student, opened up with new recruits including Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are murdered by the killer, until only one remains. Then when we find out who did it and why. Also in the film are Tom Smothers making a terrible accent like the Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens makes his sketch Pee-Wee Herman. The general terrain is not very well developed and pretty blades, but some fun scenes appear, namely the Bad Pies House and the poker strip scene. The end seems to be thrown together, which is a shame. Generally, well for about ten or fifteen minutes in total, the rest you can simply go forward. Maybe it's on television, but it's not worth buying.
