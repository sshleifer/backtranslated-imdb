Van is a sensational film about a guy trying to lure the girls in his new van to seduce them. The only thing this movie does not fail is the description of the van in the United States in the late 1970s. Apparently it was made entirely by amateurs. It's garbage, but I liked it! I have to admit I'm a fan of the 70s trash! Hope this makes it to the IMDB 100 bottom! <br /> <br /> 2
