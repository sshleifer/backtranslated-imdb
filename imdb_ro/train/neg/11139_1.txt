There is not much to say about this movie, it's horrible. The actor and dialogue are far from being decent, the story of the hybrid werewolf is not very well explained, and the whole thing has plot holes here and there. CGI is something you would not like to see. He's so amateur that he makes me vomit. The only good thing on DVD was in the Extras. The drum of the gag. Everything else, waste of time and money. I hope no one will buy this, it does not even deserve to rent it. Just stay away from this.
