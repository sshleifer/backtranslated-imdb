There is nothing unique about either the TV series or the movie. What is a prequel for the TV show that is not found everywhere in life and entertainment. Before David Lynches the disgusting style of the story goes after. <br /> <br /> From Moment, the body of an inappropriate little girl escaped to the beach. And being introduced to some of the most mindset numbing the immoral shadow character of the Twin Peaks. For the mind numbing almost disgusting pedophilia how the film seems to say romantically about the destruction of a human life through some random psychedelic phenomena in the Twin Peak: Fire come with me. <br /> <br /> I've been following everything to make sure I'm not missing anything. I did not. These are obvious sex fetishes, which lie on a long series of shows, accompanied by a ridiculous pornographic film. Save yourself agony of suspense and look at anything else that has at least the ability to tell a story, rather then seduce you in some kind of mental porn movies. I've heard a lot of comments, panting and laughing at how great David Lynch. Because of its ability to define misery and tragedy and make it a wonderful thing. This is not the life that imitates art, as much as a lost version of art that does its best to inspire a life without a mind. Do a favor and avoid this garbage.
