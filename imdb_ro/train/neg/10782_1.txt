only scenes that made me laugh, where the Christopher Walken in it (crazy film) rest of the movie was just boring. in the first hour or so does not happen that way real.jokes should be fun and not zeta jones is really overacting.julia douglas roberts job done routinely rate was ugly (yes really!) in girl next door (where have we seen this before?), which is guy.for short.i really did not care what would happen to the main characters. If Cusack fell really a suicide attempt, the film would have been more interesting to watch.
