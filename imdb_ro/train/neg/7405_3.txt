I think they really let the quality of DVD production get rid of them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I tried to play on the third DVD player I tried. Anyone else has this problem? It's very hard to give the movie an unusual review after you go through such a mistake to play it. For one, I have never seen a Finnish horror movie, so I was kind of bummed that the movie was made in English. Also, since it has never been clear what is wrong with Sarah, it just came out as a retarder and that's why I was hoping someone would shoot her in front and make all horrible happenings disappear.
