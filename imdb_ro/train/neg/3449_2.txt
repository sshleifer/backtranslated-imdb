Fortunately, there is no video about this Wannabe Western to be a long-term vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was scary. The story of a weasel who lives in the reputation of his big brother of arms and who came out of town by evil boys just to return to resume their cities with a new courage found must have been written by a writer behind the room. On the whole, this show smells. The story is practically boring, ill-conceived, and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I have to go completely from the other reviewer who found her "... undervalued ..." The critics hit him at the time and so earnestly. You will have to catch it in the last show, if you are late and you have insomnia. But if you can stay through it, you have more power than most of my friends.
