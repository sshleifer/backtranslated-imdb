Guy is a loser. I can not get girls, they have to build, they are chosen by stronger boys, etc. He saw her, saw her, she went on. I'll have to say that Rob has to go over Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler. There are two funny parts in the whole movie. I could not finish the last 5 minutes. I'm bored. "Animals" is a good movie. I usually like Adam Sandler's films that have the same plot. But that was too much to impress. The jokes are very old. So, believe me. This is not a movie that most people could really come across. But some have done it, so I'll be nice. 3/10
