I wanted to like Magnolia. The story reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia has done a bad thing in the middle of the movie and I was lost. I almost stopped then and there, but I felt I should stay there until the end, I just knew it would be another 1Â½ hours torture. Thank God I rented instead of seeing the theater. I almost cried in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest blow in the pants was the final scene of the frog. My DVD has not yet forgiven me, and I do not blame it. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring and useless film.
