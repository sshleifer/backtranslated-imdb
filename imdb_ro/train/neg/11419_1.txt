I think we have seen such things before: college graduates do not realize they have a good time, crying all the time, sucking their lives. This movie is very derived from Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can do from it: they basically have the same plot. If something good came out of this snoring-fest, it was music. That was. As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but again, I did not expect anything less. This movie was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be watched with a sunglasses. <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict: it's 1 in 10.
