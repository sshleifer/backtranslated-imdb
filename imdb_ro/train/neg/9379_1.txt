This movie . . . I do not know. Why would a character so procrastinated as Pippi Longstocking and cast Tami Erin singularly charmless, I will never know. Why would you spend money on art and some special effects that are not so bad then you do not mind editing it properly, I will never know. Why sets and costumes are sometimes in the period and sometimes not bizarre, why did they order such bad songs, why the script does not make any sense (not even on a crazy film level for kids). . . . what did they think? Nothing about this movie is as it should be. Each piece is called (and always stupid), each sound effect is slightly wrong, every editing is in the wrong place, each performance is bad in some way. It manages to create a proper atmosphere, despite all the problems, but NEVER surprises the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
