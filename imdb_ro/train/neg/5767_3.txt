As has been said before, the visual effects are astounding. They're amazing. Personally I use Blender and such graphics is not easy AT ALL. But that's all the movie. Not only is the plot confusing, but general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to escape who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when entering the picturesque room, Proog explains that "an extra step and (you are dead)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between negligent man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, from nowhere, kills Emo. Proog immediately transforms from a guard who takes care of a lost child as a "sick". It betrays us. Not only is this depressing, but we do not care, because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. It's not a story about someone, by fighting, becoming stronger. It is depressing and has no point because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world brought to light as a great drama. In my opinion, the film is seriously underdeveloped in all its aspects. However, the graphics are amazing, but a movie is far more than eye candy. There is no truth, no struggle and unpleasant surprise that will end. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
