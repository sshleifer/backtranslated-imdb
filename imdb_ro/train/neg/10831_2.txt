I think this director / writer has something to say. Let's see what could ... a. The frog storms would be terrifying? b. Can I make someone like Tom Cruise say the word "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Cast my wife and tell her to say the word "F" every 2 seconds. This as much as I liked the beginning and the frog storm. The rest was a relentless, long-lasting (under-drafted), much-indulgent. I'm glad many of you liked it! <br /> <br />
