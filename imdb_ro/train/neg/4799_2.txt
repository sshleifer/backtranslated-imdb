I myself am a big fan of horror films with a low budget of 80 years. This is not the worst, but not yet spectacular. The plot line is decent, but it takes too long. You're half the movie before you get to see any zombie action. Killing is not very creative, and zombies are not too cunning. I think this movie would have been better if it left the zombies and just made a mafia hit. It's to be noticed, but I feel that this movie has stolen at least an hour of my life. I'll credit the movie because it's somewhat original. If you really are in horror films B it's worth watching, but if you're not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for it.
