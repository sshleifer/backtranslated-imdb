With such movies you know you will get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eve like a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors do a good job. It's the direction and the missing story. It should have been overlooked if the jokes were working better. The problem is just that there are not many jokes. Of course I laughed a few times. Apart from the parrot that was talking, there was no ounce of creativity in the movie. I blame the director does not use the premise to have maximum potential. Eva certainly has the ability to show more, but she did not have the opportunity to do so. Generally, this movie is ideal for an afternoon afternoon. Something other than the fact that it can be jumped everywhere.
