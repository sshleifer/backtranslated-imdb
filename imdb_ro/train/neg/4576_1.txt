At first sight this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite fun and thought-provoking. Of course, when something causes thought, it can then be examined. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with inconvenient and unfounded conclusions. The connection between "What Bleep ..." that you would see between science and spirituality is not, in fact, rooted in science. The transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that group meditation can reduce crime in a particular area, Washington DC in this case. In fact, the HRA crime rate (Homicides, Rapes, Assassins) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no fall in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, every claim that binds the metaphysics of science may and has been revealed. My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people, or a joke. In any case, we suggest that you do not waste your time. If you are looking for a long film about science that could cause thoughts, we recommend thinking about Mindwalk (1990).
