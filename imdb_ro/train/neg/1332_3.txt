The novelty of hearing Jay Leno's four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this inappropriate whim of the police partner. In COLLISION comedy, the pelican comedian joins young Pat Morita to watch a stolen turbocharger (thinks Leno's car lover has played a hand in the plot?). The two lead hard, I do, but Leno is not an actor, and Morita's routine of fish gets old. The film has an attraction effect, but its worthy moments are becoming less and less limited as they exceed their operating time of over 100 minutes. Fans of Leno's comic talent will feel disappointed; anyone else will just be bored.
