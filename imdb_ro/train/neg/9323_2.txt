What have I just seen? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The concept of serial killer clown is actually quite scary, seeing there are a lot of people who fear clowns ... but having a 300 kilogram nursery rhyme reciting the clown killer makes a mockery of the genre. He still asks me how the character Mark could not escape the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he must get tired at last. The whole end made me rise up and, literally, say loudly, "What have I seen?" It seems Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and they managed to get closer to the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ..... yes, that's something people want to see so fast *. /> Another thing I found stupidly hilarious was the opening scene where the clown gives a woman and says "What did you do?" Well, what do you think she just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second that the main character was hit by the rider and called for it and then 5 minutes later saying that violence did not help ... the script writer gave the line to the wrong guy ? None of these movies makes sense anyway. The movie was more or less a low low budget low, which I was aspired to buy (all 3.99) and I had no entertainment besides sexual scenes. I'm surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgy, it would fit in. We hoped the movie would have a value for entertainment as other B movies, but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of garbage that is not even worth watching. 1 out of 10
