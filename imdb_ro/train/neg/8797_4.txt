An incessant frenzy of intelligent visual ironies does not necessarily create an eye-catching film. "Wig Faye half (with a very playful, if Karen Carpenter, Faye Wong)" has much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl's story element meets a back seat for artistic intelligence. Character development is unequal. Emotion is missing. For music lovers, "Wang Faye's" Mung Jung Yun "(Cantonese version of" Dreams ") is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a tongue version called" Zhen Tuo ". Both are on the CD, although only "Mung Jung Yun" is found on the official CD of the sound film.
