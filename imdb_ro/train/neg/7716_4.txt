I only had the luxury to see this movie once I was young enough, so much of the film is unclear in trying to remember. However, I can say it was not as fun as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been the most memorable stuff in this movie is the song and scene with the elderly couple talking about the poor Timmy. Apart from the fact that the film is really just scenes of small tomatoes and large tombs around and people acting scared and overacting that people should do in a movie of this type. However, just having a very silly premise and a captivating theme song do not make a good comedy. Granted this movie should be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, though, it should still make jokes that are funny and do not try to extend a funny premise in a lively movie. Perhaps a short would be good if the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to arm a bigger red was actually pretty good. The trailers themselves looked like a fake trailer, but they did not really make a complete movie and a bad one at that.
