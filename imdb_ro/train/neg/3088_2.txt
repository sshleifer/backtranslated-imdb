1. Aliens are like plush toys and hand puppets, while they have arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens have mastered intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to push an open door to the vaults, but they can open a closed door of five people. The old security guards know how to get a C4's end position and wait for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly dismissed without explanation. Apparently, the US Army boot camp in the 1980s involved several "garden tool combat" sessions, including the death squirrel rotation. To impress your friend caution, you have to "save the world ... err ... the neighborhood" from strangers. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are prostitutes, either openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Expensive nightclubs look like bad meals. <br /> <br /> 8. "Cheerful" waiters double up as a dancer for The Fontanelles (how did they come to talk about it?) Who can only make dance moves from the 60s. <br /> <br / > 9. The private army secretly dreams that it is Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The apparent grenades have a flash-bang set. <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned alive, it seems that it just leaves one with minor burns on his arms. <br /> <br /> 12. US Army personnel Sargeants seems to be always in the area and do nothing about the aliens in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens seem to always "go home", which means back to the vault in which they were blocked. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracted by bright lights, which means that Los Angeles area is supposed to be the home of the protagonist is the brightest thing in the area. Displaying 16 scenes of parking in a movie makes the audience beat for more. <br /> <br /> 16. Vans from the 80's seem to have horrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. Comedy should happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 18. Horror is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. In this movie, it is assumed that spirits and tributes will happen. 20. This film heals insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard noises every time they are used, not just in battles (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this). The simple truth is that this movie just went wrong. Period. There is not too much meat on the bone nor does anything very good. Even on average. They were. However, I have seen much worse, and the fight scene against rake is pure comedy, intentional or otherwise. 2/10 - False 4 was worse then. At least the film did not take it seriously.
