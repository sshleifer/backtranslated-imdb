Something that really does not go down with the theory of Al Gore (and his supporters) is all about "concens". If there was such a consensus, why do the "believers" in the omnipotent global warming sense the unrepeatable need to try and bruise anyone who asks them. Why is it that anyone who is not part of the global warming line is faced with accusations of being stupid or on the salary of petroleum companies (apparently a professional global warming researcher does not mean that you are on someone's salary in the wonderful world ... ) Why is it such a great need to tell everyone how to solve the whole question, when is the very nature of science to question the hypotheses honestly? For some ideas on answering these questions, read Prey by well-known oil tanker Michael Crichton ... wait, he is rich and not on the salary of petroleum companies. He took only a tremendous career risk in not picking up the line of the greens and other worshipers in Kyoto and telling the truth as he researched it. By the way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would lead to almost no drop in temperatures, according to their own supporters? Only a few questions that Al Gore certainly did not feel like getting every penny in the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again. So who is a stooge ..?
