The film was written 10 years ago and another director planned it with SRK and Aamir in main roles The film was finally made with Vip Shah guiding her And Ajay and Salman play together after a decade of HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM 1999) The film still collapses because of its manipulation in the 1990s and the worst is the gaps The film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients and we also have the triangle of love Everything is predictable and filmed and too clichtered There are gaps as would Ajay flee from London Airport and make room for himself with no one? even the way the band starts is not convincing The second half gets better with the reversal in Ajay's story, destroying Salman, but unfortunately the climax drops and the movie ends on a bad note Direction of Vip Shah is accustomed to sub media Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre Among the actors Ajay offers the best shot though it's not convincing as a rock singer yet he does gorgeous as Salman's negative role, however, irritating with his crap and punjabi talking, he just impresses when he gets drowned and on him Asin is nothing big just a play piece Ranvijay should stay at MTV Man Puri is ok
