What the? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny? Does he really think it's funny? It's weird to see the confidence to be funny. Man has no identity ... I mean, you can see his idols, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence right away, because he is trying very hard to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that it does badly, unevenly, and what comes out is a part where he seems somewhat Denzel with that macho-s ** attitude and then abrupt goes to Martin Lawrence, funny and stupid-stupid comic. It has no personal connection, that is, it does not contribute to the personality it is trying to sell, and I'm sure it has nothing to say personally. He was really Mr. Dull-boy in person. We really hoped for Hollywood and the black community in America would find someone better to launch in superstardom, like Don Cheadle, for example, but maybe pathetic Jamie is better off the generation that remixes the old one.
