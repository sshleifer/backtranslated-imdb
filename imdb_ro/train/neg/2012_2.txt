Life in a future fascist or almost fascist state, severely restricting personal freedoms, is a recurring theme in modern literature as well as filming. Such works warn us of unwanted tendencies in our society to take care of; but to be effective it must also be fun. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in having enough fun to read on a large scale; while with movies the problem is usually the other way round. The first work that became widely known was probably "1984" by George Orwell (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and a film. or read it: and when you feel a bit depressed by man's inhumanity to man, touch it for Cinderella 2000. This is a low budget budget comedy movie based on the same theme that provides easy viewing, but ungrateful; and as in 1984, the calendar passed over the previous period. Most of the comedy is torn, though there are only some really funny moments. In order to exercise your mind in the long ranges, you can focus on the question whether this movie will gain a new life extension by being released as a DVD or eventually disappearing into oblivion on as existing tape copies will deteriorate as a result of redemption. There are many worse movies that appear today as DVDs and I honestly do not care much about what happens in any way. So far, the best of these genres have probably been "The Handmaiden's Tale," but I would happily change them all for a well-done film of Jack London's "Heel Heel" high-pitched novel. As ambitious as this, it still seems incredible that no modern filmmaker has yet dared to try (IMDb only displays a silent B / W version made in Russia in 1919).
