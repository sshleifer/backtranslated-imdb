This is the version that even the author hated it because it is so schmaltzy. They gave a "happy ending" and changed a lot of dialogue, and it's just a big bunch of sugar. "Stage Manager" is pretty good, I think he has created his role, but everyone else enters the 40s acting style that is really present. The only feature - music. It has one of the best scores ever recorded and it's worth looking for in a record store. Overall, I think the Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version of 1989 is far superior.
