Could someone tell Shaq to stick to what's good at basketball. This movie was not really fun at a stupid level. In this movie Shaq plays a cute who lives in a box boom is not an orginal a genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. He should help a boy played by francais cappra as annoying. This movie had the thinnest story in the water world, the action was terrible and I think anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it.
