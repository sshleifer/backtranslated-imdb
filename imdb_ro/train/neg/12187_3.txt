The worst collaboration with De Niro Scorsese in this aggressive, agonizing, lasting mess. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this movie, with the great hammer of sound and door noise that seemed ridiculous and embarrassing coming from such a craftsman. The distribution is totally scattered here, and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the greatest lawyer in history who would ever think he can defend someone! De Bowro, the De Niro's psychotic, is nothing more than the typical psychotic killer of the 1990s. The scene with De Niro and Lewis from the beginning is very strange and the climax goes further and we all should be more than tired of the psycho-stalker that never dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences. Renting the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
