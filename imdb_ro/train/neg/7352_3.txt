This was not funny in 1972. It's not funny now. Unlike a lot of other people, I do not bashing the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I'm glad that bit, or rather I enjoy the reaction it generates in people annoying PCs - I get tangled because it's badly written and acted. The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the 25-year-old British people will recognize as soon as he has been an impresionist favorite for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
