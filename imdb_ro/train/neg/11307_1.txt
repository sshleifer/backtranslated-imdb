The Perfect Stupid Weapon. I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal's films intended to scoff Jeff making his forms of dancing music at the beginning of this stupid film. The plot is predictable, the fights were correct, and Jeff behaves like a couch that beats a kind of weapons in a single scene.
