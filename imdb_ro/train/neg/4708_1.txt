Ouch! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends screamed like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought it was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life) and changing "Quest" to "Test". actually I was wrong, he did not change anything, he heard about this show. One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was about to be released. which was the story of this show, so I ventured to look at her, and here is my answer "WANT MY HO HOUR BACK" (Because I saw this shit and "My Gym Partner is a Monkey." <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst performances I've seen, first of all, the beginning, with the stupidest song in the world, then the plot.

I know, I really miss La b (before being transformed into the new Dexter, too This is a bad copy of that good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. Do not look at it, do something more productive in that half an hour than watch that bullshit.
