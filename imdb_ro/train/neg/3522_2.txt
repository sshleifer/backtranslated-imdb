If you like the Sly standard moves involving top action, stunning stunts (the incredible does not intend to be free here) and delaying the dialogue; you will love this pile of mountain goat whale. We had great hopes on the trailer. I thought that Stalone would be forced in his days to "have been" to join smarter people and make an action movie that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting and action prevails credible). I want an action quite close to reality so that you can imagine the fear and enthusiasm that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects have made at least a ridiculously ridiculous scene. Judge Dredd is just better because you know he's coming to the theater to see a comic book made in a movie. The character, setting, and anything else are out of comparison with anything we might encounter. Cliffhanger, on the other hand, turns a climbing guide into Rambo before you can say "yo, Adrian!"
