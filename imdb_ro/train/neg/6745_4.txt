This is a low-budget "Scream" movie. "Maddy" is a new worker in an unnamed office where she meets and begins a relationship with her colleague "Chris". During a hot party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they are part of a "Murder Club", where everyone has killed someone for blows. When Maddy misses her and kills someone for the real, try to get out. The film looks good and there are the requirements for this type and the level of the budget (nudity, gore, maybe a few bigger cameoes than the ones distributed), but after crediting you will ask why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching her.
