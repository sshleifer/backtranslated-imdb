Watching this movie made me think constantly; why do I do such a problem from broken brakes? There are a million options to slow the car! In the movie Speed, the writers thought at least for a good reason why the car was not able to stop ... There are not many good things to say about this movie; all the usual narrative clich√©s appear, the actors are very bad, the story is like a leak like a sieve, etc. This makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
