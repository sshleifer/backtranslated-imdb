I grew up as I shed the interdimensional stories of Chronicles Wrinkles in Time. My dream was that someday the screenwriter will come over their child sitting in a big sofa reading A Winkle in Time and thinking what amazing movie would do. Unfortunately, the screenwriter did not manage to change his characters, casting the blade humor and destroying everything. I know it's a hard task to change a well-loved novel in a movie. But why can not you stay with the book? Why do you have to change how the characters think and act? For those who have not read the book, take it, find a soft sofa and let your imagination run wild.
