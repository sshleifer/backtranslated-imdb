Redline is a Fast & Furious knockoff without any of the redeeming qualities. You do not have to have a plot full of complications, with multiple twists and surprises, but NEVER NEED! This is the equivalent of a porn movie where story and dialogue consist of 60 seconds in the beginning and the end. Except that this is worse, because you do not make the money. Mind-boring, boring, impossible sequences of racing and a terrible waste of beautiful, expensive cars that almost get bad points because they appeared in this movie. Sure, he's hot, but who's desperate for a woman on the screen? I feel like the director sitting there with a dialogue hat and parcel of fragments and gave a ball of 8 times when they changed scenes. No serious person who does not know or know anything about it, would watch this movie and enjoy racing scenes.
