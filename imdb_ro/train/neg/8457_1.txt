I just saw this movie because I was very impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But it's not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and made sense. Taurus had none of these. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that there could be no good, after all, Michelle Forbes had a primary role, always painfully sorry. A poster here called the incoherent film. Another called the worst movie ever. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad I got it for free from the library, but still I feel handcuffed. IMDb has to include a "0" in the vote "the vote of this film", just for movies like this one.
