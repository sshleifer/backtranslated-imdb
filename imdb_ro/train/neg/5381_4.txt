Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship between a shy and retired videographer and an artist who struggles equally, living in Big Apple, develops an unexpected story with an online dating site. This is not so unusual, but what it is is their method of communication. Starting from verbal, they take notes and later communicate via video. The film is based on the creator's own relationship (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), who, besides writing and directing, lead characters as well. With avant-garde elements, anti-plot and docudrama, the film spreads in the wind, with an undecipherated structure buried between narcissism and self-indulgence. As the film unfolds, a brief separation and deterioration of their form of communication once intriguing ages, because the couple faces the weights of reality. Focusing exclusively on inner conflicts or relationship issues, the film fights through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor disturbing. This could easily have been eluded by the addition of subplots and external conflicts, and a third act, to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama leading nowhere. What is even more aggravating is the film comes down from the story in reality, which ends suddenly with an open and unsatisfactory finish. This would have been good and dandy, but it is neither a question nor a sense to be discovered or thought. (On a side note, the movie contains beautiful animation and a vibrant and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of production.) But as always, watch the film and decide for yourself.
