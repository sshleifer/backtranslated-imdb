This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunately, Venus official does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female turtle, this has taken it from the tragic story of four unique male mutants who will never have their own family once they have left. The biggest mistake was passing the Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the voices of the turtles were wrong and they all acted in character. He could have done a better job, better models and animatronic and NOT VENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not bother with these people ... it's a trusted material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural. they were totally disoriented by the chopper. the main baddie, a type of dragonlord was corny. the turtles have somehow looked at the things that their bodies hang on, what about the stuff around the raph's thighs? fools sculpting plasters! <br /> <br /> If he looked normal, he acted in character and escaped Venus, escaped the bad sounds of cartoon children ... and writing better could have been good.
