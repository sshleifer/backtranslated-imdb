This is a little little about paranormal performance, though it feels like Art Bell and his idiot have figured out how to carve a career from the attitude that Carl Kolchak has exemplified. Of course, it would probably not be an X file if this show would not have prepared this audience so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-hero type, but he's a plausible (enough) type to deliver heroic deeds. See his work on some of Alfred Hitchcock's old presentations. Here is the main attraction, it does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife that is a distraction. In fact, there is not a lot of sex appeal to the show. What I notice is that stimulation is not really suspense in a typical way. There is a lot of humor thrown into the air at this show. Sometimes, he just tries to reach the climax. There is a thread from this show that comes up to the current MAD MEN show in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under the Sopranos surely emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
