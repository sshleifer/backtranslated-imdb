Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he dies $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and make sure he does not fall on gold wizards. Such a Mrs. Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) returns to the scene of women's disapproval. We follow the story because girls are given more money to appear in a show instead of the escort role they have accepted to perform for the three months that Bill is in New York while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. At the end, love is in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story is interwoven with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. And Rogers is not that good. He is quite pleasing, but it really only comes to life when playing drums or trombone. There is a very irritating character playing a cab driver (Roscoe Karns), and the movie is just boring.
