You must realize that when the name of the star is wrongly classified in opening credits, you are not in a good time (credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some nice cars watch them, pull them, act, if all you want is an action, because the relationship with what exists is the least fine and it is unbelievable. The motivations of the characters, especially Gooding's, are worse than unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not embroiled hopelessly. All I can think of is that Andy Cheng has to be a great guy to make many good actors do a project on this foul (he can not have anything at all, is he?).
