I was delighted to discover this comedy for the past sixty years, looking at some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very small Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was so complicated to find that the movie does not work as a comedy or as a perfect film. Ustinov is playing a small cruise only time in jail, setting up his sites in a large US-based corporation headquartered in London. Deploying former director-general Karl Malden and Newhart technician, Ustinov moves away as a computer expert and immediately plans the "perfect" piece of the film. To do this, they must go through a security system that protects counterfeiting that protects the corporate mainframe. And here's the problem. 1. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the movie is incredibly trustworthy and stupid. The blames of the blades are taken at face value and it must be the only computer center where you do not bother with the camcorders. The second problem is that the guilty (really fraud) happens during the first 30 minutes of the movie, which destroys the rest of the image, largely in dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is unfortunately mistaken as Ustinov's neighbor neighbor ditsy / secretary who simply can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she seems too together here, too composed, the party asked more for a physical, tired comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe it's the difference in age, but the later romantic relationship, as lacking real love as it is, still comes from a bit creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and he thought well at that time, but I realized he was unhappy, proud and a sad loss of a big caste.
