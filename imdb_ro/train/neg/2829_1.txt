The worst and full of people who should know better (the distribution has six Oscars among them). It is in Africa "contemporary" (it was made in 1979) and refers to the slave trade. He is a terrific writer and actress (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden are in a low career in this field) and lacking enthusiasm for no moral focus. It's also ridiculously plotted. For a minute you do not think any of the characters will behave as they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer leads, but you have the impression that he was on the phone. This is as bad as it happens.
