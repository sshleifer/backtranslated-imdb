To be honest, I heard it was bad enough before I decided to pursue it, but I'm never one to let others influence my views, in fact, I'm more likely to see something out of contempt! Bullwhip had one thing for me before watching anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those wonderful eyes were in it I immediately interested. The picture is not very good and, in fact, it is morally dubious, all the characters are corrupted and corrupted in some form or way, all motivated by greed or egocentric wins, all are good and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of clever people, and to create a tilted culminating image. Unfortunately, no, and when the finale fills your eyes with sugar, you can not help shouting that you have been mistaken to see a bad movie, no one in the cast comes out with credit, with Guy Madison, wood in the extreme. <br /> <br /> Not even the wonderful Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
