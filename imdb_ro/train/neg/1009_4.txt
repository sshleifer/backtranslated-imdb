*** THE REVIEW CAN CONTAIN ONE SPOILERS *** I will make this short and sweet review. I bought this movie from Best Buy because she sounded interested and had top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad could it be, huh? Well, it's pretty bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a journalist who wanders over a case that can lead to corrupt policemen at Edison's Police Force. LL Cool J is Deed, a force policeman on a special force squad called F.R.A.T. (Primary Attack Tactics). He collaborated with an evil policeman named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the opening screen we see that Lazerov & Deed pick up some robbers from the bank, but at night they bust a few boys who make drugs. I do not want to give too much, but things are bad for the boys who make the drugs. Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman), goes into a process involving Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects the wrong game, and with Ashford, some investigate it turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who is still in the frame of the F.R.A.T. the team joins Ashford to try to bring corrupt policemen to justice. You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performances are quite steady. The only person who gives total performance is Dylan McDermott. He is a complete case in this film and made me a believer. LL Cool J is terrible in this movie. He says each line in the same way and shows almost the same emotion. It was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The movie begins with a beautiful act, but then shoots it on the rest of the movie. The end is far from satisfying. Do not waste your time with this movie. I put Ebay on this weekend.
