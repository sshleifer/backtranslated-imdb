This movie is hilarious. The problem is that it's not a comedy. A classic scene implies that Kurt Thomas happens to find a pommel horse in the middle of a village square (which he uses to shoot bad guys). Another is trek in the "Village of Crazies". Too bad that this movie was not made to be a hoax, or that better ratings could have been made.
