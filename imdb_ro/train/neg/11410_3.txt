Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrait as GIDEON. This movie could have been a classic that Lambert played as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. because the story line is significant to us alive, the performance of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excellent. 3 out of 10.
