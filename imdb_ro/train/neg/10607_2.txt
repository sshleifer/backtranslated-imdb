Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career by continuing the Universal Soldier. But the movie saved him? I think he's going to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we see the inside of a facility where you see the bad guy of the movie. Scary, right? But not as frightening as the actor (details are the following). Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (I do not remember the name ... well it does not matter anyway), trying to get rid of some muscular men. Of course, they are the new universal soldiers. More muscles, less brain (just like the movie). After a while, Van Damme struggles with Goldberg, but then the "mission" becomes aborted. It was just a test (is this movie a test for our nerves?). It seems Van Damme is working for the government on the new Soldier Universal project (Who saw the first film that he may think this is the most illogical thing the Van Dammes could do). But it is a sequel. And there has to be a "story". Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". After about 20 minutes, a super computer hears a conversation about closing and abandoning the project. Of course the cube gets angry and makes all the soldiers kill everyone. Van Damme escapes from the plant, but the computer sends some soldiers to hunt him (He wants Van Damme to be a soldier - because he's the best (really?)). And guess what, Goldberg is one of the hunters, who has always been a bad punishment for audience before being sharp. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After a story, Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife - the reporter in the first film). This is a final show where Van Damme is fighting Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see yourself. It's too fun to say). you will see that this movie is a waste of time. So, do not look at him. But if you do, keep a six pack with you!
