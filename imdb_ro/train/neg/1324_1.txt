"The Second Coming of Suzanne" is still one of those Surrealist films that are trying to come as sophisticated, yet all he does is bring the spectator to sleep. Like other movies of this type, the dialogue is limited. Everyone is more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shooting. However, cinematic cinematicity so there is nothing to keep your attention. The video is said to be "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on the film." Yeah sure. It's right up there, watching such stimulating events as an ice melting bucket or a walking turtle for a mile. 1/10
