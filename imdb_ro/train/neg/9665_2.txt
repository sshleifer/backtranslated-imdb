Interesting? Hard. The "scientific evidence" that the film gives its point of view (which is essentially that the Jews are cancer) is so stupid and lame, it is almost ridiculous (if we do not know what happened at that time). /> Important? Nah. I can not imagine that the Germans (even at that horrible moment) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Triumf des Willens from Riefenstahl. Now it was the movie I was impressed with. This is just stupid rubbish. The "best part" is a scene from M (one of my favorites of all time) where (jewel, as the eloquent says reminds us so eloquently) Lorre plays a child-molester and killer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. I did not know M was Hitler's favorite movie, was not it? No, it's just STUPID. Even for the kind of Nazi propaganda. 2/10.
