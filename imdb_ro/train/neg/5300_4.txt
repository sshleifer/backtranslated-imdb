I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts around the world and I've just watched this, the episode that started it all in British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think out what came out of this movie so appealing and I can only wonder who saw the massive potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it such a wonderful and classic series. That being said, this movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode and British episode). If Columbo had been made as the original "pilot", it would NOT have to go too long or be seen and loved around the world. In this movie Lt Columbo is elegantly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his relatives who are supposed to be, and is quite aggressive. There is no chemistry between cats and mice between Columbo and the "villain". It can be seen, but only for the novelty of seeing Columbo started.
