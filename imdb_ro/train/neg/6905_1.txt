Polynesian dog dogs drink, fight and make a flow of sexist, stupid and unhappy observations. Real life The Polynesians are much more fun than these stereotypical cartoon characters. The Samo woman, who was supposed to not show or did not act Samoan, seemed rather like a white woman who was having sex with someone with a whim. With the weak lines like the water story you can not say anything about acting - even the brightest actors can not do anything with this scenario. It's sad to see Polynesian actors wanting to play so sad stereotypes in a movie that does not have a good scene and just two or three "jokes". What a loss of money Kiwi taxpayers, what opportunity lost to make a wonderful movie about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they're so bad and mindless like that.
