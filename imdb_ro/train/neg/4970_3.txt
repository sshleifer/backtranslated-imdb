Well, folks, I got stuck in the movie tonight, classifying papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the kind of honor they deserve. Iceland "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've ever seen and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version is classified as Christopher Lambert. Yuck. What I did not like? CGI for one. Amazingly bad. More important is faithfulness to the story, not to mention clogged action. I'm used to both versions I've seen. Happy Indifferent, Peter
