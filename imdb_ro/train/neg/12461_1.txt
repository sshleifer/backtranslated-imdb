Contrary to most of the comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, I and my family thought that watching this movie on DVD, at home, a total loss of time and space. In short, a film based on a scenario whose writer was too smart from afar. Rather than trying to tell a complex story in a clever and clear way, it was assumed that consistently tossed largely vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vinyl of different story lines of a dozen of "story-lines" to the audience made a wonderful and clear view. No, sir, no. What makes for an extraordinary view is total clarity, precision, parcels and story lines - and characters - that have a beginning, a medium and an end. This type of cinema presentation - like dim sum experience in a Chinese restaurant. - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme Glory of the Lord, then, for Hollywood TV and DVD presentations and British film noir of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director and actors knew the value of a clear story, of a diction and action that meant something. This is a DVD that this family will never see again.
