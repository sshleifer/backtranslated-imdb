I think you have to give some points for the courage to write a musical about a lesson of history, but how about decent music? Actor Howard DeSilva has the role of destroying the interest of injured children otherwise? <br /> <br /> Is William Daniels's contemporary style (for time) acting to appeal to a demography of the 1960s / 1970s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the Broadway audience with blue hair). Sorry, I find the whole piece dated, boring and acting too strident for the screen
