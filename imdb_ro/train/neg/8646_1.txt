This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I had to get up and go to Tape 4, but I blocked it. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on boys! Who's the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit panels? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly helpless. Aside from the bad movement and the agitation of the room, I thought to use the events of September 11 as a reason to make Larson Lunar Implodes in the full screen near you, shameful and disrespectful of the September 11 victims . Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, supposedly one of the terrorist planes on that day, was terrible. The movement of the room did not make me feel bad, that stunning cold stunt did it.
