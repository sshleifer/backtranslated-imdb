I can not even believe the show lasted as long as it was. I think it's all part of America's dismantling. Personally, as David Spade said, I enjoyed this performance better when he went through his original title - "Seinfeld". What bothers me most about this show, apart from the obvious basic sense of "humor" and generosity, is the pretentious way in which episodes are called. Indeed, the very good performances are still funny after many repetitive views, such as "Rob gets accidental hypnotisation," in the "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "Lucy and Ethel's work at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor given to the great programs by spectators. That writers and producers of "Friends" would have unconditional hubris to designate their own episodes, in such a way, before anyone even had the chance to see it a second time, speaks not only of mediocrity and lack of original thinking from the writers mentioned, but also from the sculpted minds of their spectators. You have read the comments of such people and you can come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of congratulations. The real sense of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in cafes and search for actors, but they somehow manage to live at $ 4,000 / month. apartments? Be real. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic life of New York with Rosses and Monicas, all the same. This New York is not there for anyone to make less than a six-digit earnings. But, luck with all that, anyway. Now, close and pass Soma.
