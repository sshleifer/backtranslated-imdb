Sorry. Someone has to say that. This is really a boring movie. Maybe worthy, but boring, though. I almost wept with boredom when I follow her. The act is pretty awful, the story is traced and predictable, the score and the workroom are totally standard and amazing. It's one of those movies that you are not allowed to hate (because it's people with disabilities), but I hate to suspect that almost everyone is doing it. Interestingly, critics have been so kind to this film. I suppose they too should not be objective. This was done to win prizes - which I remember did to them properly. But it was neither interesting nor fun. I did not see the song so I can not compare it.
