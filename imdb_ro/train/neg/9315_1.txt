This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was awful! I can not emphasize them enough! The actor, the director, the story, the characters and everything about him was bad! It was so strange and clichy. Do not be fooled by the cover or label line "The Texas Massacre is nothing to laugh at." Are you kidding me? It was ridiculous. The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until you reach the main character Brendan, OK now turn it off. What we got from the film was: A bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people end up in a cabin in the middle of the forest, and a clown who plays nursery rhymes kills them in uninhibited and fake ways. This movie was a waste of time and money, and it would be a waste of money and time too! I tried before most of the movie because it was so terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it's still not worth it! Just looking at the lid is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst EVER movie! Rating: not worth one.
