It was a good story, but not very well said. I liked the themes and the main story line, which was not as clear as it could have been. Perhaps too much happened and a lack of ability to rule all of this. The actor was good to drink, some were stronger than others, and even stronger actors had inferior acting moments. It took me months to go through the whole movie because it did not keep my attention and the flow was bad. I just finished watching her and I'm glad I did it while the movie is finally moving and has a continuity to the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was below the hair. Would recommend for the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and I mean, a little.
