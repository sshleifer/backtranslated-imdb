It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It starts a bit slow, but it ends when a De Vil flare is made. The base ground is the same as the first film. The brilliant part of the adult film is the bird that thinks it's a dog. The birds speak like a man (Eric Idle by Monty Python) and bark like a dog. It's the comedy that the movie required more. See it in the matinee so you do not have to pay the full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
