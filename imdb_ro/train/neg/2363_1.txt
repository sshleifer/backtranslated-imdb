This movie was terrible, the first movie was not that great, I mean it's ridiculously ridiculous if you did not have enough of the first 5 movies you had to add yet, why not do that in a series continues like James Bond, I'm telling you exactly why because the bond films are actually really good and these movies just smell, I do not understand, it was supposed to be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for my good granddaughter he would not have been scared of such a ridiculous horror attempt, a spitting in front of people who at least want to frighten at a certain moment in a so-called horror film. No more than these movies.
