Cover art (which contains a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it look like a martial arts movie. (Little.) I find it interesting that the real title of the movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a US condoms brand) This film is loaded with homoerotics. If you like these things, then this movie is not that bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are many views of the wings and the bottom of the actors (a scene features even every actor with an erection dipped in pants). The film is also bathed in gaudy colors such as lime, peach and red. From the point of view of the cinema, this movie is a dear queen! Several scenes present characters standing close to each other, occasionally touching while talking. Also, the hero's cousin likes women, and every guy in the movie is trying to kill him. Is there a message the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Get into the battle scenes? (Yes, one's particular parts are in one fight). Martial arts scenes are short and unimaginable. Without luxury here, just the standard moves you would see in an old Chuck Norris blow. There is also a machine tracking scene, which can be the first movie movie tracking.
