This movie is simply terrible !!!! Work slowly, slowly at the touch of the point and wooden characters that should not have been there. The best part was the Iron Maiden show singing in a movie at a theater and that's it. the end was worth watching and waiting, but that was it! The characters in this movie have almost put me to sleep. Avoid it!
