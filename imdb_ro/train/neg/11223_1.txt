I watched the movie and I was unhappy to say at least that the movie could not communicate with me as a public. Language will shame on the street. <br /> <br /> Parcel; a father who does not force any son to marry, seems to have been forced. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother who asks the great child to quit with an enemy would not attract attention other than the attention of the weak mind. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the whole movie for a laugh and laugh I made my stupidity to lose 3 hours to convince me that the movie does not even look first. Hope it saves you time!
