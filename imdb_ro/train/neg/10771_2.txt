I've never been watching kids for years, so I lost "Here's the tigers" when it first came out. (I did not even see "Bad News Bears," even though in the 1970s I worked for the guys who set up the funding for this movie, "Warriors," "Man Who Would Be King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show.") Now I like to check old and small films and find people who have gone through a great career despite being in a less-than-wonderful movie since the beginning of the year. Only a few minutes in this movie I could not go and skip the credits to see if this movie was a young actor who went to bigger and better things - even though I was forgetting that his appearance would create something of interest because plot and acting did not do their job. Here's what I saw Wes Craven's name in credit as an electric gaffer. He has already made two or three of his early shooters but has not yet created Freddie Krueger or made Scream movies. Perhaps she was due to a favor and helped that little bit. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the credits expressed as "Aesop", a strange character in the film. F. J. Lincoln, in the 1970s, just a few years ago, appeared and produced adult movies. He was associated with the adult spooful "The Ozporns", and only that title is funnier than all the attempts of "Tiger" combined humor. Allowing the fact that an adult actor was placed in a children's film is an indication of how people doing this film should have gone to bed.
