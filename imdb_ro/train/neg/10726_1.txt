I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is good enough, and you are wandering about what is to come ....... What is nothing. All open lines remain open; two characters that at first seemed to be of importance are completely left out of the picture, except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I was crying if Ilya did not do better to let them go out completely ... As for the remaining character, nothing is done to her either. They simply visit a terrible place, and suddenly the film is no longer about her, but about geriatric witches who spend their days making bread dolls, drinking homemade vodka and seemingly intertwining each other. Some may say that the film is doing well in showing a collapsing society like the IFFR judges, but for me it's just an inappropriate taste, inappropriate room work, a stupid scenario, and a terrible evil direction. Therefore, I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to scoring: 1!
