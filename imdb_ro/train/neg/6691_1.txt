MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND EVERYTHING IS HARMFUL I BREATH THIS MOVIE! what drugs are you! this could be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad acid journey, all the time, I have to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the beginning to the end, the bright rows are an endless masterpiece of satanic cinema. when I thought to watch this movie with my best friend, my Jew and his family, we thought "oh hey, it might be funny, it will probably be bad, but still a little funny" how I was wrong, we were not prepared for how horrible the movie might be. All my friends aligned to lobotomy as soon as the movie is over, and during the movie, one of my friends tried to cling to the belt, while another tried to grab her wrists with a wooden spoon. I'd like to watch the video from The Ring, so pain and suffering would have ended in just seven short days. For all those who want to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! you may think you are a "tough guy" by renting this movie, but this movie will break you, push you down and urinate you.
