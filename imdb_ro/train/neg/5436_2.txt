A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital when a team of doctors tries to surgically remove a DVD case from ***. <br /> <br /> We gave up the excitement of the prospects of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels brought me a lot of fun and the previous adaptations of the script were great, but boy, I was wrong. First of all, people who cast the cast must be asleep while doing this. I imagine the casts went that way. - Tell me, do you like the fish? "Yes, I really like fish." "You are wonderful, you are hired. You have some money." <br /> <br /> There is another scenario. I read Chabon, who I hope has become blind before seeing this and has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I do not stop why I was annoyed as it was, but it could be related to the fact that listening to a 90-year speechless speech with a dysfunction of the right cranial lobe would have been a treatment compared to they spit out children of the second degree massacre. <br /> <br /> This is a real line in the movie; "If you tell me something that you never said to anyone beforehand, then this moment becomes unique!" Unique? To stay? Is that so? Of course you do not like it. Please send me the Imodium. I'll have a whole band. <br /> <br /> Directing is ... fine. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just said his grandmother exploded or not. Stick to comedy. There's no way to make ads. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it allowed me to hit my head in a wall so hard that they brought me back to the Stone Age. I give him 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched a 1-star movie.
