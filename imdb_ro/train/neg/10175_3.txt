I could not sleep last night. So I got up, overturned the tube and the movie was activated. Film makers gave more than they could chew. As ambitious as Forrest Gump. But Gump reads like a fairy tale where an extraordinary lucky man guides us through the epoch. TGMB relies only on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a musical on Broadway, where actors have to beat him. The purpose of each character was to fill up an archetype of 60 years. Take the way we are presented to Finnegan: Embracing the black maids and receiving a framed picture of MLK. Crime, I'm talking about hard. Why do not you just give her a shirt by saying "People in the Black Heart"? Sunshine: "Is not it free love, man?" Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA square." Excuse me? In the 1960s, there was nothing about LA. rather than giving you time to prove what Berkeley made unique, we just hear this buzzing about not going there. I do not even remember the name of the black kid ... It was just an object used to show how racing tolerances are the other children.This is, vintage pieces should not be this cheesy.Get "Dazed & Confused." Here's how we are presented to the football hero, Randall Floyd.We do not see it for the first time on the football field.In fact, we never see him playing football He was introduced to the class by inviting his poker friends to a party In "Dazed" feminism is not a casual by-product of a chicken that has been beaten. more organic than that. She was refined in the ladies' room, in a discussion about I Gilligan's slander. Serious ideas can grow in the brightest settings. But real life is like that. Some of the hot comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I'm so disappointed with this baby-boomer porno play.
