One-touch comedy that probably puts modern modern feminist teeth on the sidelines. Betsy Drake's official is in love with the idea of ​​children and marriage, putting her hopes in women's magazines until she spies super-bait as an elegant bachelor, Cary Grant. The rest of the film revolves from one foot to the other, while Drake relentlessly pursues his career. I think the word "perky" just about the amount of Drake's approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her prostheses, I started to overdose. Grant's role is generally secondary and less his usual flair. There is, however, a scene that almost saves this slim exercise. Drake asks Grant unhappily following his lecture to a room full of respected ladies. Here, her persevering manner has an endless freshness that is truly remarkable, and if production has not rubbed our nose in that impressed 90-minute grin, the film could have been more than a dream of a girls' around 1948.
