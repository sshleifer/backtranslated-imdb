"Pandemonium" is a horror film spoof coming from more stupid than funny. Believe me when I say, I like comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. "Airplane," "The Naked Gun," "Furious Saddles," "High Anxiety," and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that make a difference. "Pandemonium" is not there with these movies. Most of the scenes in this movie put me there in amazing silence because the movie was not that funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times, and this is all this movie. Geez, "Scream" had more laugh than this movie and it was more of a horror movie. How bizarre this is? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
