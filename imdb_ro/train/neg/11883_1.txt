When I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and could not sleep, I decided to have fun while I was sleeping. This movie was on HBO and I decided to see it. What is a mistake? Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you really care): a neurotic man with a candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a ridiculous company theme. Suddenly, he is given the chance to "go perm", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this film. But with a safe job and a safe income, Josh decides for any bad reason he does not want to do it. He completely defeats many minor tasks, and laziness and lack of ambition fills me with contempt. Its inability to send more "very important" letters in a certain period of time should be hilarious, but it's just bad. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer and turns around in bed together (obviously Josh's fantasy in real life, as never would have happened). A bunch of other things happen, but it's too cute and inherent to get in now. Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice during it; the first time was Josh Kornbluth's opening kick (my initial reaction was one of suffocation), and the second was when she was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying person I've ever seen in my life. He is a Jewish man who is not attractive and has an exaggerated weight that I should think he has sex with beautiful women. I do not feel the character of Josh at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I do not appreciate the unsuccessful humorous attempts. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
