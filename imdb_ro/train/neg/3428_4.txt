Well, unless it's the case of Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr., (here billed without Jr.), Rufus Jones for President will be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes which I saw from the early age of the talkie and would not have deserved to see about it. Mrs. Waters is excellent here singing "Am I Blue?" and "Under the Harlem Moon," while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz has prepared for his superstar status as an adult. She is very good dancing here, because I realized he was a tiny person with experience for decades. So if you are willing to ignore negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should offer good joy. P.S. This marks the fourth time today, I've seen and heard the song "I'm glad when you got killed, you're upset" on the movie, this time by Davis. It must have been a very popular song about this moment.
