"Intense Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch filming offers a gore and a lot of absurd situations. A horrific veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted like Professor Bruckner. the act is slow and the climax is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He is in a seven-year coma and then he wakes up and goes into a bloody ravage. Intensive Care is clearly influenced by American slasher films including "Halloween" and "Friday 13". Killing is hilarious, and dialogues are painfully stupid. But if you are in the right mood, you can give a piece of garbage a look. You will laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me!
