So, I know I voted 1 out of 10, but it really is not worth more than a half-star. I hated him. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can not believe that none of the stars signed to make this project ridiculously absurd. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story of sucking and encouraging someone who sees this in the video store does not even bother to take it and read the back cover, just to leave ... I do not even want to get into the film because it's too bad to pontificate. Do not rent! It's terrible! Horrible!
