At least with the adolescent geek receiving the girls' films, the guy is usually unpopular with the girls. In Virginia for 40 years, he is replaced by a 40-year-old guy who is popular with women, but somehow he has remained virgin. But then, should not you hire your brain with this movie or miss the little of being in a coma for 20 years? One of a series of movies in which 40 things act as teenagers and women for some reason thinks it is a quality that is attractive enough because I want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent television comedies seems to think it must be based on gross and superficial characters to laugh. They made the films rude. They made them behave like all Americans have a 15-year-old mental state. Where will they go on? <br /> <br /> This movie is entertaining and brutal of entertainment with nothing to recommend.
