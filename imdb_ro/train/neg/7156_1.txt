Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, definitely not after the endurance test of a movie. As long as I got on the ground to continue without hitting the button fast, she only knows that lord. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me! Maybe I do not get the premise of the movie ... or maybe I do not appreciate the mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although the movie has such a mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonald's. In addition, the characters were all terrifying and there is more character development in a cartoon Tom & Jerry. Yaarrrghhh! Why do they do it? why do I look at that? It's enough to run and join a monastery or a foreign Legion! YAARGH !! An absolutely awesome movie in almost every aspect. Besides, it's not bad.
