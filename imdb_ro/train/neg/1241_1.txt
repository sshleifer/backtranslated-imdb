This is the worst movie I have seen for years! It begins ridiculus and continues in the same way. I thnik when something happens in this movie ,,,, and the act is worse. The finish raises it a little and saves the movie on a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but that sucks.
