This 1974 exhibition is organized by Leon Klimovsky, and a brief look at the photographs and advertising packs can make you think this medieval story is somewhere between the "Inquisition" and "Sadomania." Unfortunately no. This is a strict PG business with tortuous tornado sequences, with no nudity and little edge. Naschy (of whom I am a fan) tightens things like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de lacion". Unfortunately, he is more a pantomime than anything else. One has the feeling with this movie that I have seen (and did) all before. Therefore, strictly for Naschy completest only.
