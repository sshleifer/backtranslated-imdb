Based on a self-service novel by a one-time friend and group by F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck goes on in unbridled excess as an alcoholic forced to be drunk-or-be-cursed; in contradiction with Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing age, late in his life, the highly honored author really lived a quiet life and fought effectively against his alcoholism at a time when AA was still not well known . Fitzgerald was by no means too proud to recycle his stories to support his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a Chevrolet second car, his life was 180 degrees different from the one described in this movie. Basically, every 20th-century film made during Daryl F. Zanuck's leadership. almost every film directed by Henry King was a work of excellence. My beloved was an exception.
