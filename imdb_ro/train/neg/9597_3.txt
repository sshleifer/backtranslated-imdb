As much as I love Japanese movies, this not only cut it off ... A movie that should be about the rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot. The photo is OK, although I have seen sword fighting scenes much better in other Japanese movies, fast cameras and the way the characters followed did not convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice your presence. But the worst of all was how the plot evolved. I have to admit that sometimes I have had difficulty in understanding who was who and what happened. .. In any case, the Platonic love between the main character and the other was completely useless and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. In total, if you are looking for a Japanese action movie this is not. Its very slow, with very few sword fighting scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
