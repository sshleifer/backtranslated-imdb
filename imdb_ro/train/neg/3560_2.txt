For me this is a story that starts with funny jokes about the fanaticism of the frogs when traveling with a ladder and when they are in business meetings ... The problem is that when you look at this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasy / funny situations again and again and again. It's predictable. It's more like a television story where you can go and go back without losing anything. I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough even when it's a comedy must have more variations and a kind of message to his audience ...
