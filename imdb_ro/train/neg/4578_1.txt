Another worship returns again. This is not a spoiler because the REAL end comes after you've researched those who have brought this too long pseudo-scientific infomercial ... The Ramtha Illumination School. When he needs any religion / philosophy to hide behind a screen of OZ-like deception, I'm leaving. Thank you to Ramtha I saw a borrowed copy of this movie, on the recommendation of a "friend" ... that he lost valuable resources on this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe they can go on water" enough to take that guidance to be "logical" ... in other words; walk, drown, or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" value in terms of entertainment, especially to create the most relevant character in the history of the film ... eeeeeek!). If you have to see this movie, borrow it from one of the brainwashed people who recommended it.
