I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this respect, she is a great actress. This film contains six stories. It's a new concept that flew from Hollywood. So it's not a new element. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and makes a friend to let reporters be interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he pretends to be her boyfriend. Priyanka Chopra is not yet a good actress. When she shouts, I get angry. Salman Chan can not play comic roles. But in his serious parts, he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He enters a crisis in the middle of his life and is attracted to a much younger woman, forgetting why he really lives; wife and children. Anil kapoor en Juhi are naturally born actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold feet and throws the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She has an accident and suffers a loss of memory. Now she does not know she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a cab driver. She meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who is in love with an Indian man but is about to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to that man, but he falls in love with her. I never liked Govinda's movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I liked it very much, as it has grown in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! She plays Ram Dayal, who is only married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to take a serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between. Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actor but he is funny! I like his movies. Now it's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. To make a story from six exciting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there stories come together, but they are not significant to my characters. My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Leave that woman in the bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should do more movies, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan can not play comic roles, but serious movies. This is about his life as an actor. This movie is a shit and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. It's like having the opportunity to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you just let him sing a song.
