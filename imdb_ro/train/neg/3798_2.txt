And that's the only reason I own this DVD. Now I did not see the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information from him and I, here, saying: What? Why? Because in the first film Alex was a man. But again, the first one was set in the future, so perhaps Alex is new and the scientist just made this female Alex this time. Who knows, at least has not been approached in any way in the film. Here's a brief summary of the plot: Alex, another child then (or whatever you want, as it is, is in the future) escapes with her mother using a special time boat and ends in the 80's of Africa. There Mother is killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows in an African tribe. Then the tribe is killed by a cyborg of the future, and Alex leads and hides and finally kills cyborg. So there. Sounds familiar, is not it? Terminator is not the only movie that has been broken here, Predator gets his fair share, and I think the first Fly movie, Vincent Price One, is specially nominated to give a solid foundation to build your cyborgs head. <br /> <br /> Let's see what else? Okay, the movie was a rather small film, but it had bad bad effects for a movie in the mid-1990s. It would have been good for an 80-year blow. The biggest problem is the plot. Things are just happening and the viewer is just interested. Nemesis 2 is not the most crappiest piece of cinema that I enjoyed (?) Let me watch it, but it is not at all close. I will not say anything about acting, to be honest here: did anyone expect Oscar performances worthy here? Well ... at least I found Sue the hot price in that Amazonian war mode. A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals in terms of superior quality. And, in spite of the basic plot, the movie he makes alone does not make any sense. A movie rating at the camp: 4/10 I occasionally laugh at the unhappy film's evil, so it has little merit in it.
