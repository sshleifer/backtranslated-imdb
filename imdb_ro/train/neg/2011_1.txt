This movie is pure guano. The mother always said if you can not say anything nice ... but even my mother would say I have to do my part to alert others about this movie. I can guarantee that this is the film Geoffrey Rush wants desires to leave. I hope Greg Kinnear has fired his agent ... from a cannon to give him the script. After that, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to write "There's still something about Mary." I have always been a fan of Wes Studi, thank you for all that you hold of the holy being wearing a mask through the film, so maybe people will not identify the movie with him. Start from the promontor with a movie spoiler of Batman movies and then lose something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects. The jokes are telegraphed one hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall. If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world, please refer to "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! Do not get close to "men in mystery"!
