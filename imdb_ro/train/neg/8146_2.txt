(Dir-John Bianco): A pretty gangster blade movie about a Brooklyn-like family who wants to say a lot of four-letter words and kill people. The only thing that was interested here was their attempt to show the federalists a lot like a gang. This is the only good shot. The rest of the movie was predictable and inexpensive. The quality of the picture on some scenes inside the bars and floating joints almost made you think there is a problem with the DVD player because of bad contrasts and some actors have been hard to hear sometimes because of the bad sound. The actress was pretty much the characters of all the favorite gangsters from better-known corny names such as Vinnie `Knuckles' and Jimmie` Tattoos, and the plot followed pretty much these models. So, go see a better gangster movie before you put your money for it.
