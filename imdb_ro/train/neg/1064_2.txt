be warned: this film tells a lot of love stories without any coherence. The only intention of this movie seems to be love show in many different ways. Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a brief idea of ​​a plot. The writer tried to build turning points that were meant to capture the viewer. However, this did not work because you did not get to know the characters before or these "jokes" were just stupid. This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and do not care.
