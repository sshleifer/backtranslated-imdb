I would not recommend this if you are not interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete the set". There are some good performances (like Uriah Heep) and well-targeted moments (eg beats), but overall this is really weak compared to the BBC version of 1999 as well as previous releases. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in the story that do not really serve any major purpose, except possibly down it (stolen jewelery being a case at this time). The American cast was badly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is like Betsy Trotwood, and her British accent is just a little better than Dick Van Dyke's cock. I understand why Michael Richards was chosen to play Micawber; he does it far too much, and becomes irritating. He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond the eccentric and becomes simply absurd. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but he almost expects to give him a black shirt and tie David's mother to a railroad (though this may be partly Dickens's fault). <br /> <br /> I have this free with a newspaper. He helped pass an afternoon on Sunday, but I felt more disappointed than enchanted at the end of her
