Very well done. Terrifying actors and an end that the director appeared to make from nowhere, because the film was not altogether boring. Shockingly, this film is considered a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. Everyone who left the theater had the same opinion as me - what was the purpose of the movie? References to Iraq were either bizarre or not properly thought out. I am amazed that this film gave a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative review, but hopefully will prevent some people from making the same mistake. What a shame I did not have a Q and A at the end of the movie - now that could have been exciting.
