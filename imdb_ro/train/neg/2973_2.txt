I have two very important complaints about this movie. That my local rental store has racked up what is very clear a soft base porn in the "suspense" category. (If I knew what it was, I would not have missed the time to rent it first. And yes, this movie is a soft porn base). The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie makes anything deviant or obsessive, not to mention a combination of the two. In fact, make the three major complaints: 3. That, for some reason, I've watched the movie long enough to find the number two item on this list. Boys, I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Find out of my fault. This movie is worthless at almost every level.
