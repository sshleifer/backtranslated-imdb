I have seen this film at the Rotterdam Festival, just like other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked a lot and was very dedicated to the project, which I think explains reception above average and marks that he received. It's most similar to Aussie's "Round the Twist" favorite childhood episode, but it's too serious for him to have that redemption facility. The film itself may be worth seeing if you are trying to make a world cinema tour that visits all the UN member states because I can not think of another Fijian movie, but overall it was generic, inappropriate (from an amateur distribution) and prey to the subordinate mentality. The moral of history seemed to be that native insulars would try to deceive each other, but as long as there is a decent white governor to enter, all problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
