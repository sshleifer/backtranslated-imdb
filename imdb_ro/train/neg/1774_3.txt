Okay, I saw this movie for the first time at 9am on Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought it would be a prize winner, the boy was in that regard. This movie was the biggest. I mean, the monster's mother shows his true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going "That's why? Why did not she show her a little earlier in the movie?" The scene is the mother and feast of the son with the blood of young women. It would not be better if they continued, you know, a killing killer who kills like young women each, after which the sheriff or a policeman learns about and goes into the old found a way to kill the monsters, save the young woman and you have 1 or 2 more people killed in the trial? I think it would be much better this way. It's also shit because the son is the main character and he's first killed. Why not get rid of your mother first? In addition, how does that power have at the end of the movie when it starts killing people? She said she was too weak. What the hell happened to Stephen this time? I can never, ever, act in any movie by an actor, after all, they try everything I can. If it had not been a good act, I would have given a 1/10 movie. 3/10.
