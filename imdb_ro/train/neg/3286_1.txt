I do not understand why we make the remake become the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is awful and it's no exception. If any of you saw the quote from Ben Jones, that is a piece of "unpleasant" garbage, he's right. Why would it take a wonderful television show I loved, I never missed an episode and seasons 1-4 on the DVD and I would ruin it, I will never know. The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was truly flaunted, or even approached in the show, save the outfits. A family show has been turned into a dirty piece of garbage and I would not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original piece) and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even nice. This was one of the drawers for the show. Casting is terrible. She could get at least one brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg. Any other role he has ever played is totally opposed to this role. The only decent half-decent role is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it's not a comparison. Denver Pyle is his own actor, which made him perfect for the role. I think the casting is terrible, the story is terrible and yet ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty and terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see. I just saw it out of curiosity, plus it was a free ticket in Season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT pay to see this movie.
