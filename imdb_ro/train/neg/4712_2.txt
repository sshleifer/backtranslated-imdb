This show is probably the biggest, ugliest, and most generous stack of steam that we've seen in children's programming, which has actually become a success. The main character, Johnny, while I understand that she should be an ordinary child, is not pleasant or even tolerable. The banknotes are bold, overburdened (that is, "I have not seen you come," it was not even funny for the first time, it's not even cute) and it has no form of primitive intelligence or inspiration. And in the end ... it's just ugly to look. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer candy eyes. I can not look at the show, because, in a way, the artistic style is just ... brutal. Hideous, in fact. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> I just can not stand that this is getting so long the antenna. While I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and should not make my hopes back ... I really miss old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls ... anything but that crap. I think it's just a desire for thinking, though. <br /> <br /> I simply advise you not to waste your time on this show. I think really good cartoons can be enjoyed by big kids. And that does not cut him.
