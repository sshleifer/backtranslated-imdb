I just looked at it. Some laugh, but nothing to write home. Jason Lee seemed to have some fun. The (long) DVD drum consists almost exclusively of the fact that it fits with uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to find an hour clock, but again, her character had to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles's father (hilarious) in 10 things I hate about you is fun here as well. It's great, but the best part of this movie was casting Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours looking at washing the laundry and feeling like I just did.
