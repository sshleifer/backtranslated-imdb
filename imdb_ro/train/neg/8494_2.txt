Waiting for a combination of science and age film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, computer history, etc., I was disappointed with this absurd pseudo-science and a mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that his writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) does not have a real understanding of mathematics, technology or history that is the subject of the film, but instead works for a kind of fuzzy artistic impression about them. This has hit me a point of blood because I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to take a look and misuse the terms and scientific ideas to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "The Waves the information has a half-life. "Ada:" I'm not sure half life is better than no life at all. " This film just makes fun - misinforms. The only ransom value I can imagine for this is that it could attract a spectator to learn about the subject he is distorting so badly. It is more likely, I believe, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology, of any kind of advancement, as indisputable to magic.
