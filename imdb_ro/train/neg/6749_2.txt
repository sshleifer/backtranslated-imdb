This misery is so bad that it does not even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted in this movie. He's not even the bastard. The rest of the actors show that porn wannabes and the plot is so blemish, I will not even mention it. Be a favor and jump at the end of the credits to listen to the upcoming TwoMarlowe band making "Better Than Sex" is the 80-year-old Disco song. Weigh a tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. Much more fun than "Bleed". Put it like this, When someone has the equipment to copy videos, but only decides to record the song at the end of the movie, you have a really "BAD" movie.
