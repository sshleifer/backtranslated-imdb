This film seems to have been a work-based exercise for the Coppola family. He does not seem to know whether to be an "A" or "B" vest. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd has to rotate in the grave. All the "B" Western slots are here. The two-handed gun, the white-haired teeth hero, the C'mon Thunder, the black beard robber, the heroin in distress, the distressed farmer, the cowardly sheriff, the bad boys, etc. The actor, with a few exceptions, works strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?), As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?), As a negative character he seems to have been more home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. Adding to the distribution of veteran artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they are not given enough to save this. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Do we have to think that the Sheen was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It simply did not make sense. Being a great lover of Westerners of all generations, I have tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this movie. The cinema was pretty good and the settings seemed very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main character, the other characters seemed authentic. If the producers were to revive the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might have thought of portraying it as it was originally written - a grizzled ranch hand, a chip on the shoulder, the type of part Lee Marvin had shone - a. What else can I say, but Thunder, the big colleague.
