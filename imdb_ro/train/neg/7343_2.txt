Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror film? Or some Taiwanese movie? I mean for a reason. It was a very boring one, even if it has black magic, including baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. After reading other people's thoughts, I expected a series of violence and gore, but it is not at all. Some blood envelopes and other blade things, if you wait serious gore or harmful effects, you will be disappointed. Well, they did not use the eel that explodes and other things to their maximum potent. Very little good about this movie; a single character that was not at all gentle and some magic black magic spells, such as an eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror look did not work, the worst thing was an albino girl (not quite that scary). This is the worst Asian horror film I've ever seen.
