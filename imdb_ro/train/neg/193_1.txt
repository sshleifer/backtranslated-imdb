Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds the banal scenes of the Maclean brothers who fall through a fall and they meet twice in a deceptive bar, which was not even suggested in the story. The figure, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius in the open air, turns out to be either wasteful or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men once expected. None of the women make an impression on the film, which is regrettable because Maclean loved women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
