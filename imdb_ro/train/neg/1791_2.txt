What about the dark film at first and sporadically throughout the movie? It's like someone put dirty water on camera lenses. Violence and nudity could leave some people, but that, along with the worst act is what makes a good cult movie. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin Vampire, "Oh, your breed is stupid." Okay, no one should ever say "alas" in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. Van Helsing character act and bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Little Little, played by Ron Little. Martial arts mischievous! Do not take it too seriously and you will enjoy it.
