Kurt Russell (as Steven Post) works as a mailing boy for UBC (which is United Broadcasting Corporation); he does not go anywhere in the workplace, offering ridiculous projects such as "Dog of Abraham Lincoln's Doctor", studio directors - because Lincoln, doctors and dogs are popular. Programmer Joe Flynn (like Francis X. Wilbanks) wisely rejects Mr Russell's proposals but has no idea how to choose a TV show. His secretary, Heather North (like Jennifer Scott), who has a double duty as Russell's girlfriend, has a chimpanzee that hits Russell when he wants to watch TV. It looks like the monkey watches all popular shows and can easily choose the results. Russell discovers the talent of the chimpanzee and uses it to advance in his career. Obviously, things become HAIRY for Russell and distribution! Raffles chimpanzee (manipulated by Frank Lamping) behaves well; Raffles seems bored and / or distracted during several scenes, when the chimpanzee should look interested; they could have been corrected by re-taking or editing. A slight satirical edge is present - imagine that a selection of monkeys hit TV shows! And, she is a monkey who receives a BEER during the commercial (drinking in a Disney movie)! A look through distribution will reveal a lot of fun television actors to recognize and try to place. You could make a drink to Raffles beer, guess the actors and where you saw them before. Here's a start - Hey, is not that "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"? Give her throat! <br /> <br /> Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
