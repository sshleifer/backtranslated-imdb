Oh, because shouting out loud, that's got to be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year round, and I'm sorry that John Cusack was, in fact, even involved in this stupidity of Stupidity. If Sleepless in Seattle gave birth to what is the same message, though on a more subtle, more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a screwdriver and then continues to strike it in your psyche for the next hour and a half (and this is an hour and a half of my life I will not come back, thank you very much!). It's pretty bad that the main characters of this film have the emotional maturity level of the fourteen-year-old (actually, I've known better than fourteen years ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was pretty pleasing . Only the first fifteen minutes of the film in which Kate Beckinsale's character plays that annoying humility of a game about throwing all sensitivity to wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond faith. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the Rockstar characters were not half dysfunctional, just as the idiots were in that "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to watch the protagonists who seem to have no idea of ​​their choice in their lives and to feel that they are nothing but marionettes for destiny and the whims of destiny. How tiring. I am sure this film will be rather enjoyable by those who would prefer not to engage in the chaotic mess of making more complex choices of life and then to live responsibly. After all, here is a movie in which our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after they have done bad things and misfortunes in the life of the two (that is, their engagement), not to mention other relatives and friends, only to get there. <br /> <br />
