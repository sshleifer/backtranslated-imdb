Well, I have to admit it was one of my favorites as a child when I watched a home projector like a super-8 drum. Now is not much to recommend it, other than the inherent value of the actors' camp being "terrified" by the skulls of human skulls. The special effects are pretty silly, mostly consisting of skulls on the wires and "ghost" images superimposed. But there is something to say about sets. The large mansion in which it is carried out is rather frightening, especially because it is mostly unfiltered (perhaps for budget reasons?). Surely, he inspires more laughter than screams. Just try not to get the giggles when the wife (who does more than her scream) goes into the greenhouse and faces the ex-husband's ghost.
