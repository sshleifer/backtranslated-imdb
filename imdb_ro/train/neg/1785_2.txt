.... And after seeing this pile of shit will not be surprised that it was not published <br /> <br /> !!!! Spoilere !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrific movie of any standards, but when I point out that it is one of the worst movies Stephen King has in his credits, you can begin to imagine how bad he is. The movie begins with two starry characters with open mouth at a horror scene: ".? My God What Happens Here <br /> <br /> <br /> Â»I do not know but surely I hate the cats * * The room pots at the outside of a house where hundreds The cat is right, someone hates cats and a deduction that he should be a policeman Oh, wait a minute, he's a cop and when a movie starts with a policeman making a comment oh so obviously you know you're going to be watching a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason why somnambulis is bad is that it's very illogical and confusing. Finally, we find out that the monsters in the title need the virgin blood to survive, would it not be better to look for a virgin in the middle-west bible of the Bible, rather than an American coastal city? He said we at least know about the motives of the monsters - That's the only thing we learn. we do not learn how to t change form or can make the machines become invisible and these jars with the end that seems to have been stolen from the TERMINATOR. Mom Monster goes around killing some cops with bare hands or throwing them with a handgun (!) But if her monster race is immune to police fire, then why do creatures need the ability to change form or become invisible? The death of the creatures is as badly thought as there killed by a massive attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, then why do monsters not kill all the cats around the garden? There was a whole hordes of moghis sitting around, but the monsters did not think of killing them. I think it's like the production team can come to an end. It was that the movie started, my complaint is in front of scenes where famous horror film directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King are making cameos. I think the reason for this is that whenever an unknown actor reads the script, they immediately decided that no matter what, he would not have appeared in such a bad movie that Stephen King had to call his friends horror to fill out cast. Like bad sleep is incredible as it seems it was not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is: "This cat saved my life"
