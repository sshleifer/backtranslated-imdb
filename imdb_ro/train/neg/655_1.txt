I got into this with my hopes up, with twenty minutes in the movie, I could not disappoint myself. Despite the fact that there was another remarkably bad bad, I kept my hopes high, maybe ... maybe someone would succeed at this point. Unfortunately, Prom Night is on the same level of quality as the remake of the recent April Fools Day, a bad scenario, a bad direction, an actress of upset action and, in general, a terrible horror. From the beginning to the end it is boring, repetitive and worthy of about ten eye roles. I saw it before, and I saw it made a million times better than that. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait DVD or PPV), get ready for the public to laugh, because they laugh. Laughter is not at the moments in the movie that should be funny, they are in response to the "thrilling" moments of the movie that are so badly made that you feel like watching the latest installment of the Scary movie. Seriously, was it supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The filmmakers have missed the sign so bad here that a large number of viewers from the theater I attended came out about halfway through the film. Which, retrospectively, I would like to have done. But not me, I had to torture myself and stay with her in the hope that it would be better. Needless to say he did not. Horror scenes are a joke, not so much because of the act, but because of the direction, the scenario, the "special effects" and the activity of the camera. The film manages to look as if it has spent a fortune to produce it, but it has come out of it with a low-budget movie. I waited halfway to see store labels in dollars for some of the props and I thought I'd see a porn star in the play somewhere. <br /> <br /> This scary movie is fine, if this is the future of the big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed.
