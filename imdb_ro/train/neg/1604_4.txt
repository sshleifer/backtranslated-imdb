Remember a movie you like to enjoy in the past that does not have the same feelings as an adult? That's what happened to me when I returned to school ... the national class meeting of the lamp. The film has a perfect opportunity to laugh, but surprisingly wanders inadvertently as we see a bizarre collection of characters, such as a woman who has sold his soul to the devil and can fire the fire, a man who seems like a vampire, and a crazy killer dressed like a woman and wears bags over his head. You are the chairman of the class who thinks it's the best thing from cut bread (but, as we see in the movie, is a coward and a joke), some smokers who do not even know that they are at their own class meeting and a man named Gary, whom he knew already exists (and no one can remember his name ... this is the joke I liked). There is a perversion who likes to grab women into inappropriate places, a deaf and pinky woman who has a scream when she calls her dog and chef (you know from "goonies" and "Throw Mama From The Train") who loves to Put the food on people's plates with your hands! The film essentially refers to a misfortune that is (or at least attempts) to revenge his colleagues for a gag that they have fired upon him (arranged to sleep with his own twin sister!). The film follows the characters as they look for the killer, building dark halls drawn by the old high school. They told him about the killer by his psychologist who seems to be a little weird. The film has some good gangs that work (pretty early), but the movie worsens slowly every minute. The real problem with the movie is that it does not know where to go. The film is quite a premise with a joke because it does not have the sure direction if it really has a direction. The cast is quite enthusiastic, but the material that must make it funny does not have the capacity to keep its interest. It's a curiosity for fans of comedy relics in the 1980s who are forgotten (this is right).
