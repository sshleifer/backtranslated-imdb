I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, I had a Commodore 64 and I loved playing Rambo on it. I was, therefore, very pleased when I came to buy this movie very cheaply. I put it in my VCR and I started: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says three words in the whole movie (except that horrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same expression on his face all the way. And that love thing in the middle is so surprisingly predictable. I just finished the whole thing fast and I went to change the film for something else.
