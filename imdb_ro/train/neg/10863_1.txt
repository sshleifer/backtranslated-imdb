LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is indeed a disappointing film. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was very good, but it really did not disappoint u ........................... ............ <br /> <br /> This movie loses its time and money. I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of her release and both were born in the cinema ........................ .. ............................ <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and was not useless in this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT reduces the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is also not are defined as the previous one. This film shows u the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> MAHATMA's ideas are also not defined and confused ..... ........ ..... <br /> <br /> A VERY LOFT DEPOSITION
