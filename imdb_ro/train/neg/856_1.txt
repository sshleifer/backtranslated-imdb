These writings write about the end of the intrigue, so do not read it if you have not seen this garbage. I found this trash in the horror section that made me think it was a horror. If I owned a video store, I'd put it in the BORING section. This movie is so thick that it will make you feel like you've lost your socks. This film contains endless photos of people who lead as if it were scary. Well I lead to work and back (and sometimes to the shop or to visit my cats) almost every day and believe me it is not scary. Start with even 20 minutes driving. Even the little kid does it. Round and round goes and never stops. What's so scary to see a child traveling on a bicycle for an hour? I think nothing and if you look at that you will not think too much. The family in the car reaches a big castle and is given a tour just walking around endlessly on the kitchens. Then man walks around an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and you can see that there's garbage.
