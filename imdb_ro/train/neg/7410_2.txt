I like the horror movies that show a real amount of mystery, such as the "silent hill" (which I realized was pretty good but still lacking) and movies that keep you guessing, that's what I thought was one of those movies. At first the movie starts with a very good suspense and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then rolls on the hill, and from there it goes faster and faster. I mentioned the silent hill at first for a reason because I can see a lot of "stolen" themes from that movie here. In general, I would say, watching a quiet hill instead of it, better, more scary, has a lot more much suspense and also the end is much better .. And the best of all, you will not feel broken as I did with this .. It just seems to be one of those "I love this movie, I will do again in my own really bad version "kind of like a movie .. Oh and one thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... that means trying to scare a baby with a bear to hug him and I will love you forever "written on her stomach.
