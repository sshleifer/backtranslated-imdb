It's hard to know what's going on through Per Kristensen's and Morten Lindberg's head when they write "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the movie is interpreted as a comedy, but there are no real jokes alongside the brutal characters of the characters (Capt B. Dick , Sgt. Silenced beads). The rest of the movie is a fun (perhaps) funny unexpectedly amusing business, with a very unsynchronized voice (with "actors" reading their lines without any sense of sensation), posters of the "futurist" computer full of spelling mistakes and a plot has no meaning. Even if 65% of viewers gave this movie a perfect movie of 10 out of 10, this is the opposite of the good movie. You may have fun to watch with some friends, but this movie deserves only a "2" out of ten ... slightly higher than the lowest rating possible only because the writers somehow managed to bring some black guys star in this movie.
