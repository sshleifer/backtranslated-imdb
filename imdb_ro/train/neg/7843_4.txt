This is a weak continuation: he lacks the interest and touch of the magnificent Cal Called Man in almost every aspect and, compared to each other, hardly seems to be the same. <br /> <br /> The return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke various Indian ceremonies, but it was a too hard attempt to fill the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, after losing its homeland, modern life has entered into paradise and live in abusive misery and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we wanted to be, a simpler time. This leads us to the broken Indians in a miserable world, and the White Man is the hero and the savior who neglects the whole idea of ​​the film. The beauty of the first is that the white man learned and discovered that true civilization is in values ​​rather than in Western materialism. In the second film, this is only lacking, and so we get to a poor film. Great disappointment.
