This movie was, in principle, Velvet Goldmine, if the five party writers took it into account and did it t.v. movie. The film has nothing to do with Velvet Goldmine, which was good at acting, writing, and basically anything else. The film had some of the worst of Wild Wild West's. It definitely had to be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their music behind the music shows. which are much better than all that would have worked if they were behind the episode of music, but they did not feel on his face.
