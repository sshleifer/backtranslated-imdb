I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or so) and I liked it then. I remembered it the next day and decided to follow her again. The second time around was not pleasant. The actor is "so, so," the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. The actor ... I'm sure it was not a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. Plan ... there is no way in hell that women would have disappeared with the first robbery a lot less in the second place. (note: Why did TT not realize that even if he came up with a sum of money for the date of the trial, they would ask where he got it and would not have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a crook!). The stereotyped black women essentially said that the only way black women could "beat the system" or get a large amount of money was to steal it and not to use intelligence or other resources. It's playing too much on sympathy b / c all die in the end (Jada bar), but it's not sad (you think they're so stupid that they deserve to die). You really do not care about the characters unless you're a superficial person. I can not believe this movie misses over 5 years.
