This is a great step after the surprisingly pleasant original. This sequel is not as entertaining as the first one and, in return, spends too much time developing the plots. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his defeat is cut in this entry. Performances are all appropriate, but this time the script leaves us down. The action is just a routine and the intrigue is just a little interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughs to stay entertained during a Trancers movie. Unfortunately, laughter is few and far from being, and this movie is best watched.
