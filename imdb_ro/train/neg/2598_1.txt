Even in a bad movie there is usually a certain ransom feature, something you can say was terrible, but it was that performance or that part of the script or that special effect, that was just terrible everywhere. The action was ridiculous, the script was terrible, with many little unexplainable Tiffany references, and even the special effects were at best. It was a very bad film and one that even Drew Barrymore's desires were removed from history. Follow it if you want to: a) suffer severe self-inflicted pain. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is a movie in which I can use the "There are ninety minutes of my life I will never come back" with a certain justification!
