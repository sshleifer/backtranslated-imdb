In 1454, in France, the wizard Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is beheaded, and the master of Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the future generations of their executioners. In the current 70s, Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his girlfriend Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a sitting session where they evoke the spirit to Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to Villas de Sade, a property of Hugo's family in the countryside, looking for a monastery with hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the devil possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers having a Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, tries to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. Last weekend I bought a five-DVD horror box by Paul Naschy for $ 9.98; Despite the lack of references, I decided to take this opportunity. The first DVD of the Horror Rises from the Tomb is a B (or C) movie that made me remember Ed Wood right away. The ridiculous story is revealed by scenarios, directions, shows, cinema, decoration, special effects and edition, and lots of naked women. The result is simply hilarious and can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
