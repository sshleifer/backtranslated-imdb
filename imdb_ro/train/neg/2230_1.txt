If you want to see a karate expert who has a gay delay, beat a bunch of Mexican gangsters, try repeatedly for an hour, then this is the movie for you. if not, then choose another DVD from the 20c basket which is the only place that this movie belongs to. the action was so horrible that I had to force myself to look to the end. The cover looks so cold, but it's just another cheap, bang gangster movie along the lines of 2 g and a bloody and threatening key street. I would not buy or rent this movie unless you intend to stone yourself and plot, edit and act really does not matter to you. is really the worst film in the history of mankind!
