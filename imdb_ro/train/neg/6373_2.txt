It was a very bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is all right, but I think she's acting angrily through the movie, not because she has her organs plucked by a man at night, but because she thinks to get her agent to put her in this piece. Faye Dunaway acts like remixing mommy Dear and ending is absolutely bad. I really can not recommend this movie at all, even though, as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued by references to his work (Ravens, the family curse of the Usher family and buried alive) might return, probably in the tomb if he knew about this movie.
