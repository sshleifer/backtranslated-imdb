I do not know where to begin. The cast is full of people who have not done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on the tape but does not appear at all in the movie. Writing is bad enough, even for college movies. It's obviously a very low budget, with a scene at the comedy house that is extremely confusing. Characters are quite typical for college films - the shy, stupid, black guy, hard boys, mustache guy, attractive girl, little town girl, and so on. The professor presented is about what you would expect ... middle-aged guy hard set who gets retired easily. If you wan't to see a college move, you're clear of that. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
