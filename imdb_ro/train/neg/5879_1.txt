I wonder how actors acted in this movie. Is Annette Bening really herself, half in and half out, pretending to be natural? It did not matter, considering that even if it was going on the ceiling, it would not have changed the pattern of the film. Brian Cox acted very well. I almost thought he always acted in this way, deceitful, dishonest, in a dirty environment where no one really cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what he does in this movie. This movie is quite disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such stupidity?
