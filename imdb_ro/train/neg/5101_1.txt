The only thing I did after I looked at it was that I would never have time to look at it again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try to win what must have been then, pay down in a holiday home then stay tuned. Wood action, low special effects, the only highlight of comedies was while our alien hero was in feminine form and this ends as soon as he made a mandatory b-movie nude sex scene in 30 minutes in the movie. The possibility of doing what could have been a decent movie disappears when Nicole Eggbert loads his alien into a bar in 30 seconds while police, soldiers, and audience Joe do not bump the woman drinking coffee, the handle cup and simultaneously wearing four jumpers. It must be obvious from another planet. Just where I wanted to be when it was this movie.
