Words can not describe how absolutely this movie is. It's a series of random and non-functional clips about everything, from a bad Batman spoof to a guy who uses it with an old dead (very disturbing) lady. The only fun thing about Underground Comedy is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. It is also rated NC-17, avoiding the only people who would tolerate this.
