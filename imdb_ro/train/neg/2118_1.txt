What can I say about Seven Lounds ... well I looked in a flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and since that flight was long and boring, the movie certainly did not help. The character of Ben Smith, Ben Smith, is almost impossible to achieve even with his ultimate redemption. The two-hour movie time and run time escape most of the time on the screen with random trash that tightens the plot as slow as possible. In the defense film, Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the movie, though not much. I do not understand how someone could actually complain during this movie when all I wanted to do was stop him. Also, Will Smith kills with a jellyfish at the end proving that killing with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
