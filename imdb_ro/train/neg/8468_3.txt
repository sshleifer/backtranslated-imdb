"They are among us" is a poor fictitious science at best. The environment is acting in this movie. The plots of plot are numerous. Aliens who have landed in a meteorite and have been hiding among us for over 100 years but need a plastic surgeon to make them human. In their extraterrestrial form they are supposed to have exo-skeletons (that's why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after the Blue Book Project was closed, but an F-16 pilot was assumed. And so on. If you want to see an alien invasion, choose "Spyritis troops invasion" and see how it works.
