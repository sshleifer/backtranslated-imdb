As we all know Hollywood enjoys changing historical events around us for our pleasure, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, bank thieves have never returned to the bank when they started shooting at LAPD in the movie we see returning twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who were shot near the end of the movie, this is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood must have a good bloodstream to add some more blood and courage. Some events have been combined and many of the main actors have played several different people, but Hollywood has always done that, why they complain? I think the only sad part is I've been watching some hour-by-hour documentation of the North Hollywood shootings on TLC that were much better than that!
