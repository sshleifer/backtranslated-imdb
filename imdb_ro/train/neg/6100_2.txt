The effort aside (this is not a review of good intentions, about the final product), this film is badly written, outdated and badly directed. The story obviously had potential, but the story is not present in this movie. Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-doubt as we did. You never knew this from this lead actress act. Actually, apply it to every person in the movie, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic on the top speech as if it were from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in an onboard meeting, and I realized that's because it makes a speech! Every idea she has is incredible in her context, and she comes up with ideas that sound like it would take a life of soul searching right now. For example, when he sees an injured man, he will start pontificating the needs of the battlefield and protect the soldiers and place white flags, etc. As it was in the movie, there is no way that such a detail could come up with a thoughtful idea in a few seconds. In conclusion, this movie breaks Clara Barton with her battles. She escapes her mankind and inherently appreciates everything she did, because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedic Britannica article. (yes, they had those then) But, hey, nice Technicolor! (who cares)
