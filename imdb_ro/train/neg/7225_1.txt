I've been through this movie and I have to say that I just managed to keep my attention. The movie would have been a little more bearable if I did not have to look at CGI horribly for a future reference to the industry if you want to use CGI to watch this so you know what to avoid. Apparently this should be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad movie that has no resemblance to a graphic novell any. Overall, the story was not as bad as the CGI, I was quite impressed with the action and thought the casting was good and less the character character would have been nice because it became a bit confusing for me occasionally , but that's not surprising, as if I told her it just kept my attention, but in all honesty I'd like to miss him.
