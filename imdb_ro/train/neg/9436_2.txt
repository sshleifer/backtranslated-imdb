Unhinged follows the typical plot of the tendency of weakness in the 80s. Pretty young girls in danger. I have to give up on the movie that used a helicopter for some of the first photos of the road trip, in fact you think that for a moment there will be a quality of production. Watching the movie "Unhinged" was like seeing a class of amateur actors who go through heating. Some of the most uncomfortable, poorly lighted, long-lasting scenes are played with the taste of an overdose of Valium. I wondered why they did not put the cue cards on the camera, so the actresses should not have changed their eyes constantly. The two main faces were obviously chosen for the T & A factor, rather than talent. Laurel Munson as Terry Chicken is as exciting as watching dry paint. Two naked scenes make for adolescent enthusiasm. Janet Penner and Virginia Stay tuned as the crazy / creepy daughter and the chick mother find themselves stuck, competing for the worst actor. Long pauses, strange expressions, accent on the wrong word, everything is there, and it's a pleasure for those of us who love bad movies. The scenes change suddenly, with careless lengths, through which you could drive a Mack truck. The lightning cartridge collapses alongside the pictures, without bothering the sky. Eighty phases of eye attack the viewer. But you know he grew up on me. Sorry about that. I wanted to hug him, kiss him, boo-boos and do better. The end does not deal with the damage, but anyway I smiled. I have my own theories about the whole "forbidden" hype, and I hope that anyone who chooses to watch this film is doing it with substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise, go ahead.
