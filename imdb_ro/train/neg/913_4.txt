OK now, let's see. What was fun in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling into the water, bad air crashes, and funny comments between the two teams. In this film they overturned the maximum emphasis, without any good. A lot of people get into the water for uncertain reasons, it's not good. Boatcrash, check it out. The funny comments between the two teams tried but failed. There are also too many personalities I'm watching in this movie. This film should be about what's happening on the water, not on land. I'm sorry to say that there is too much fun between the parties and the film's sponsors are exploited to the fullest. It's not good. Generally, I give him four out of ten, because he has some funny parts.
