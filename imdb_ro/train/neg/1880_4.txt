Despite being a great fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers's films, it was not until 6 years ago that I first saw "Fleet Tracking". I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers album (yes, vinyl), but I do not know anything about the plot. Unfortunately, while the songs are appealing and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny, you just do not like Bake Baker. As he tries to help his old partner, he continues to sabotage his career. His character does not have the humor and the usual impulse of the characters of the other films "Astaire". It's worth watching the songs and a great sounding routine by Ginger Rogers.
