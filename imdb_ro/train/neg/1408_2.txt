I did not expect much of this film after "Life is a miracle". It looks like this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer just joked about the audience: "let me see how much emptiness you can support (the audience)." Dialogues are empty, ... the script is minimalist. In a few moments, the photo is very beautiful. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's hard to laugh really during this "comedy." I laughed at myself because I was able to watch the movie to the end. If you can rise above the fiasco of the director ... you will find a good action of a few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and a very good performance of Emir's son, Stribor Kusturica. In short: too bad for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make top movies. Instead, he chooses to make this private, low budget movie with an arrogant attitude towards the world's tendencies and neglect to his old fans.
