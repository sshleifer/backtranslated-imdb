The Power Rangers, the children of television from the moronical television store of the 1990s, must be the most useless and ridiculous television show ever made. What is the point of view of this show, apart from selling the second rate of plastic nonsense for children? There is nothing to be redeemed even remotely or exciting about this show anyway. Look at the costumes, which looks like spandex has gone bad. Style parrot, earrings, and fashion style from the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at any price!
