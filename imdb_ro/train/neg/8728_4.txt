That's bad. A really bad and boring movie that has nothing unusual about it. A series of murders, the killer you do not see throughout the movie, classic investigations. And also the classic story about a policeman who realizes what is happening and is not believed by anyone, so he has to fight alone to discover the truth. Not too much in this. Vote: 4 out of 10.
