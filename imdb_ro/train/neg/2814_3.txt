He watched 8/26/2001 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, but sadic (meaningful) portrayal of a relative of the Sade Marquis who performs the same sadistic acts and enjoys himself, supposed his predecessor made. This film, Tobe Hooper, does not behave quite differently than his Freddy Krueger style films, with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a double role (Marquis De Sade and his relative). He also seems to really want to rush to Christianity, but then, finally, he loses much to fool me, leaving an incoherent sensation to the film. It could have been a lot worse if there were excesses in terms of sex and violence, but they are trying to keep this to a minimum despite some disgusting scenes. My final thought is why Hooper wants to make this film. Obviously, it took a while for it to be distributed, then it must also be announced with the name of Hooper in the title, to scare that they will make some money for his name and gore. Obviously this did not work.
