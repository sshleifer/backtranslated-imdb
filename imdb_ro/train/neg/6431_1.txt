This movie is a horrible distortion of the lies and exaggerations that have been put together by the madest anxious to ever work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film to accurately describe Senator McCarthy. It's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that someone associated with this production has ever got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote these garbage did so to attack a man who was justified by history and fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took over the place where McCarthy left and could not stop him, so the end of the Soviet Union and his cohorts. look for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason," for a better look at the truth about Senator McCarthy. It will also help if you read about what really happened to Sen.
