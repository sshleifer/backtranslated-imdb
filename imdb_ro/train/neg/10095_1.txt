Someone actually gave this 2-star movie. There is a great chance that they need immediate professional help because anyone does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can not give any star is scary enough. This movie is ... okay ... I think it's a kind of trying out a horrible porn / snuff movie without pornography or horrible real bits (besides acting, plot, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I mistakenly assumed it was zombies. <br /> <br /> Watching is actually quite frightening in fairness; you are terrified that someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and will leave, thinking that you are a stranger watching movies of home-like torture or something like that. <br /> <br /> I am so surprised to write this review on my mobile, so do not forget to try to bring the rating more than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've ever seen and can say (with my hand on my heart) will never be overcome.
