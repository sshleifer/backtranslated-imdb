This movie is terrible. Give me your dentist anytime! You can think that one of the main Arabian television stations had this Christmas movie! I can only assume she expects to have fun with Dudley Moore, rather than that. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle had more acting, more plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid waste. You do not even look at him if you're drunk!
