Trite, the dialogue and clich√© plot (the same things I've seen in all the fantastic movies of the 1980s), hokey music and character-dying characters beat this out of the game for all fans, <br /> What Saves this film of the junk pile is the beautiful crunch of Bakshi's work, rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta teaches the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... on the move. Violence is spectacular, and the direction of art and animation is unlike any other sword and witchcraft film of the period. I like to see this with the sound, playing the soundtrack at the first Conan movie.
