OK - Helicopter photos are fantastic, and the director has used some of Barcelona's most important attractions. Otherwise ... the production value was blown in the first few minutes, and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the deepest and was very effective and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He has to prepare his martial art for good use and be a half-action figure. The rest of the cast was the best wood, but especially the paper. So if you are nostalgic about Spain, it is a postcard with a turn of action and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
