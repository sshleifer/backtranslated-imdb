As a child, I thought the weapon the killer had been cool, yet I was a kid and so I was a little stupid. Even as a bad kid, though the movie script was stupid and a little boring when the killer did not use his easy knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the movie has a very strong cast in it. What scripture they read when they agree to be in this movie because it is certainly boring and just a means of showing a sword of light on a very small scale. Happiness is sometimes incomprehensible, and the end is completely chaotic. The whole film seems to be spinning around the aliens and the first weapon. The plot has two children and a guy who has an extraterrestrial encounter years later, and there seems to be a return as if he were in the mix. Animals are dead and so explored, and for some reason a guy receives the gun of the aliens and continues to use it to go into a very easy killing snare. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you're going to have a murderer, you have some good death scenes, if you're going to have alien encounters look more than a weird thing of light vortex and if you go you have swords of light, then call yourself wars of stars.
