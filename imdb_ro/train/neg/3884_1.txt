Many months ago, when I was seven, I remember vaguely watching a trailer for this movie. She turned to my naive sense of curiosity and decided to ask my parents to go to this film. Being the wise adults who are, they have told me "Absolutely not! It's a bunch of garbage." Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid in my block to see "The Unbelievable Man of Melting". It's been a while - maybe a few days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment disappeared. It's been 25 years before they came back to my mind. As I navigate through digital channels, I found this long relic of the movie. My curiosity was pirate and I decided to finally participate in the fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened. "Incredible Melting Man" is probably the worst film known to man. The film "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" show Oscar nominations. I feel violated because I lost almost two hours of my life, looking at this dirt. even for 1977. How did somebody convince a movie company to produce this movie beyond me. Do not make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents if they forbid you to watch this movie. They were right.
