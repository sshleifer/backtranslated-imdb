An actor still famous but decadent (Morgan Freeman) did not shoot for four years. When asked to take part in a new project, he asks the director's cousin's cousin to leave him in the poor Latin Quarter of Carlson to investigate the work of a small supermarket manager. He sees the Spanish scarlet Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he gets attracted to his skills. His driver does not come back to catch him, and Scarlet gives an adventure to the actor. But first she has an interview for the secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be ready; then they spend the afternoon together with a pleasant time. I'm a great fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the useless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to have a story and is supported by Morgan Freeman's and Paz Vega's chemistry and improvisations, and in fact nothing is going on for 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, the character of Morgan Freeman returning to the world of the silver spoon and saying to the plain man that they will never see each other again. Was she afraid to have a love affair with her and to destroy her perfect world with her family? Or was it a class clash and realizing that his fanciful neighborhood would not be suitable for a simple worker in the lower classes? My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A star in my life")
