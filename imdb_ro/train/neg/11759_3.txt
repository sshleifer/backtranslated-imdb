For those looking for a sequel to the South African fine miniseries of the 1980s, it's not like that. Nor is it a historic drama. Rather, it's a small fantasy that has nothing to do with the historian Shaka, but just uses his name to tell a story about Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero that is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln , Superman and Nelson Mandela. On the other hand, there are some moments of laugh-out-like, like when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and hits a dead end. You know, as Jesus would have done if he had not been so wonderful. True, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much of this would have been better. And what kind of name is Mungo ?!
