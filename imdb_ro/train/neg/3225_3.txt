Children love dinosaurs. It's somehow part of their culture. But they received The Land Before Time. Original. At least that movie had the heart. This. This movie is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean that you can just catch together any old story and show them to the kids. This movie has no plot, the whole premise is bad, and it's more of stuff stuff. Not like the soul sucks like Theodore Rex, but it's far from being a Land Before Time.
