While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie called "Making 10 Articles or Less": Producer: We have good news and bad news. The good news is we can take Morgan Freeman! Writer: That's great! But what is the bad news? Producer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I think we'll have to take somebody else. Writer: So we're hiring him for a day. A movie is one and a half hours long. One working day is eight hours. I can not see a problem. Producer: But ... it will have to spend time getting into character. Writer: So I played him a character who is basically himself. Producer: But he will still have to understand their motivation and all that. You're not saying we're going to play a big name actor doing a low-budget movie, is not it? Writer: Why not? Producer: That's ridiculous! But well, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too. Writer: Of course. Developer: This script is a load of nonsense. It would be good to make money in this. Otherwise, you must have the character of Morgan Freeman plug Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. Writer: Sure thing! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a second ... what about a small baptism with a "ten or less" expression band? Writer: Oh, I think it's pretty weird. But we can not change the title now! I doubt that my scenario actually has a great resemblance to reality, but not "10 Elements or Less". This is a good action case, but bad writing and I do not like to see how it happens. When viewing an independent movie, you expect it to try to send a kind of message. I think he would have tried for the old tired "do not let anything keep you back" message that was done to death in much better movies. In any case, with "10 items or less," the only message I received was "Look at Morgan Freeman!"
