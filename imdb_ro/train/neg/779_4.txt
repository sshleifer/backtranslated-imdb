Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the plots have worsened. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes acting stupid. His jokes are overwhelmed. His mother is the most compelling character of the show. How can a mother treat her son this way, well if she was the daughter, but she was her son. I give this show 4/10 just because the first shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. I do not know how these shows have been playing for so long. <br /> <br /> If you were bored as you were and you have nothing else to look at, I would suggest you look at it.
