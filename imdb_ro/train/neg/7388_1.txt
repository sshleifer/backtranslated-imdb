drss1942 really took the words in the mouth. I liked Segal's early movies, and I felt like the only one who still believed him. I just saw this movie (ok, slept about 90% through, so i did not see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was at the DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not take this movie and did not dare to know what happened at the end. There was something weird about Segal and others. She reminded me of the original Mad Max, where the voice was reprogrammed, but in the same language (Australian is English, right?) Anyway, if I had 10 fingers, everyone would look right now for this grievance of Segal.
