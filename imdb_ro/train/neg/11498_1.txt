Gadar is an example of one of the worst Bollywood movies. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make films related to the epoch, offers a garbage film. The songs were boring and they are not the type of song you want to listen to in the car, the total volume. Sunny Deol is renowned for making terrible movies where he beats a bad 100 guys on his own. He even hits a metal prison (Indian) and hits a car that is moving away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of shameful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. Sunny offers a pathetic performance by repeating once again the same role. A guy who pretends to fight for his countries, using violence. Amisha Patel is down with her dead sexy dead body with an amazing body that I would like to bone. But even she could not save the film as a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, as usual, in this movie it does not. Maybe because he played a Muslim, but he does not act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a poor performance all the way, I'm sure she'll agree with some people who love to see that Bollywood actor beat 100 boys. Save me.
