I really like all Tom Robbins' books, so I was very excited and interested in seeing a movie made after one of his books. I knew there would be no possibility that the film captured even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. Even Cowgirls Get The Blues does not include an eighth of the book's content and seems to focus more on the love affair between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Together with the incredibly poor plot of film, I think the better actors could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit Robbins' descriptions in Julian's book in their five minute clip from the beginning of the film. Those who did not read the book might enjoy the film, but like a huge fan Tom Robbins, this film was only a disappointment.
