Shame on the films Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, who seem to have lost their intelligence over the years and giving them a balance of money in this piece of cinematic crap that is not even worth the You Tube standards. I scratched my teeth all the way to the end with the schizophrenic direction, with a line that did not materialize, and on the last scene I felt ashamed that my country and the filmmakers could "snap" on such stupidity . Shame the actors to take this work and even comment on it as a particular piece of work they can hold. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed with the choice of the film. Kareen shows enough skin for hit puberty and Akshay comes as dim-wit. Anil still a retard with a pubescent fascination for English. His associates were commendable in acting and the bizarre cinema scattered over the last 15 minutes, it was enough for a blood vessel to appear. Do not miss out on any brain cells, energy, or money to see this - Go back / Rent AMU - with Konkana Sensharma - a beautiful independent movie that ever comes out of India. Intelligent, lively, and a wonderful story that touches everyone with intelligent actors and gave me the hope that everything is not lost in Indian cinema.
