Even if someone did not realize that vendors were in poor health at the time of filming and died before the release of the film, THE DRIVING PLAN OF DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful view. It's supposed to be a laud to Sax Rohmer's famous oriental character, but he has no interest. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-oriental tones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. There are almost no real jokes or gangs, especially actors who act idiot and who pierce straight lines. It is particularly worrying to see Sid Caesar forced to hunt curses and racial rasings for laughing attempts. Most of the other actors are upset too. And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to build a formula to regain his youth and a British British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not 100% bad; he sends a strange heat like Smith when he talks about his fetishist attachment with the lawnmower and moves strangely like Manchu when he expresses his love for English entertainment. But, most of the time, he plays both roles with a tired grimace, leading to more comic possibilities. Sellers' routines in which they rejuvenate their power of blurring with electrical shocks are terrible; seems too convincingly agonized to be fun. <br /> <br /> Some really witty lines, a sponge by Burt Kwouk (Cato in PINK PANTHER movies) as one of Manchu's servants, and funny musical numbers by Helen Mirren can not save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedy genius, they will not learn anything from THE FIANDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
