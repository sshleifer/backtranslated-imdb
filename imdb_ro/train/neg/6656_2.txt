This becomes two because I liked a child but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it ... I can not give a descriptive review because it would have repeated one thing after another, Do not say anything that someone else has not said yet. The only other thing about this show is that it's pretty ugly, with the babysitter boiling to the stupid thing running around and that's what I got a cousin who loves this show and it's the weirdest and weirdest person I met, this show should be shot in the air It's always the same thing always ... It's got to make better performances on Nick I'm really tired of stuff like that.
