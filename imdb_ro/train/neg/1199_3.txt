This horror movie is really weak ... that is, if this is the right movie I'm commenting on. Nothing scary happens because a family adopts a nice German Shepard kid. I had a German Shepard and it's a very good dog. I did not get the idea of ​​getting one from this movie though, but rather from the comedy "K-9". This is another story, however, together. This movie does not have too much horror, because the most terrible scene is at the end of the year and really looks like cheese. We also see that a guy almost put his hand in a lawn mower. It's about that. The father suspects something, however, because his family seems to be rather weird, somewhere he finds out that if you keep a mirror while you sleep, you can see if they are possessed. However, a horror movie very poor, even by television standards ... the television films that work are there as the "Owned House" is pretty good and there is another movie about the house of a haunted house about a woman and these strange, good creatures. This is really quite boring.
