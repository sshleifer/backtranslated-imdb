This very low-budget comedy movie caper only succeeds to be a low budget. The dialogue is awesome, the tracking scenes are uniformly boring and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of accidents and explosions in a parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie (a vinegar port early in that scene is sure to destroy and break the shit on the bad boss movie - no propulsion is here without a purpose). The whole movie depressively reminds those who occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he first gave a director a few dollars and a room - but without the discipline that Corman would impose.
