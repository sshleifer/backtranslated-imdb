As someone who lived and still remembers that he fell alive, if the 70s were half of this fun and (semi) normal, they would have been more enjoyable. The children of that age did not act or behave anything almost as brilliant and normal as these children. The young man of the country was still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture, all the rebellions of the 1960s that he had caused, especially in the behavioral department, petulance, gentleness, self-children, compared to "Happy Days", and see why: there were both sitcoms that took place 20 years before they were broadcast, and both provide only surface images depicted by the epochs, even close to its scope, showing only the obvious - fashion, toys, music, counterparts, etc. That's it. For those too young to remember or were not born then, I was confident, the 1970s were not so, more than "Happy Days" were at as in the 1950s, because "M * A * S * H ​​*" did not accurately show life at a US military base during the Korean War, etc.
