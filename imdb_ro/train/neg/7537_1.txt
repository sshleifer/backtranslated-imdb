And I thought the Beach was bad, except that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for terrible scriptures, if one can understand what the hell was the point of that movie, give yourself a foot on your back. It's a cross between the village and a terrible scenario. It starts to catch your eye, and then, as it goes on in the plot, makes no sense and does not make me start finishing !!!! What was that? The only thing this movie does is Nicolas Cage, his usual humor and his ability to be fun in the most strange situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie you're watching, save yourself five dollars and come home and turn something into a fire, and when some ask you why, tell yourself the stupidest thing that you've been doing, came to mind, and there you go!
