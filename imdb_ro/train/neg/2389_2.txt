Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and scary fingers) who meets abroad, finally finding her true place in a group of cowgirls boasting peyote on a farm dedicated to the conservation of macabre; Phoenix Rain (Arc) is their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, with his thumb or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and just wrote across the map, like Sissy (maybe it was his goal but does not involve an audience). Notorious flop-box office was not that big, it was ignored and it can be seen why: there are a series of sketches in search of a plot, and performance, direct touch and cinema are all variables. Thurman is a stitch who appears next to the highway trying to take a stroll, but that puts the kibosh pretty much in Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but should have) offers the safer performance of the doctor working on one of those fingers. Two fingers down.
