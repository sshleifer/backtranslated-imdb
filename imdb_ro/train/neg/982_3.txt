The real star of this ridiculous story is gloriously technically colored. A visual treatment for the eyes, the film fails to stimulate the mind and the heart. I was intrigued at first by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer should leave their religion to "find" their capacity for love. What follows is a great disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in production and feels his torment. Dietrich's stunning closet dominates her performance - sometimes her face is frightening to look at an awesome mask. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula for the liquor of the monastery (which reminds me of Chartreuse's true story) - when he leaves his "marriage with the god", the reaction of the monks beside him keeps the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels good that Boyer has escaped his past. However, the following journey is too predictable.
