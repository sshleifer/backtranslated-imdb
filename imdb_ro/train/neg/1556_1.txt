I was China in this movie. We chose Sheeba Alahani screen name because I was modeling at that time in Italy and could not tell me the correct name, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani because it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I have not acted until now (and it looks like this), but it was so fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously was not useful). They called my voice (thank you for kindness). David and Peter were an explosion on the set, humorous and good jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax exemption according to privileged information. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun we had "acting" in it.
