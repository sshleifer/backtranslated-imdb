First, title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the friend of the cult leader. The actor who interprets Igor believed that shouting loudly, laughing hysterically and having a tight smile while pulling you out of the eye would be a great way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of shouting (because he did not actually speak) in a loud voice. He would also say idiotic travels. For example, when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a noise, Igor seeing this, shouts Paul, not Paul, why did you do it? In another scene, Igor tells a victim that it will have to get its own instruments for surgery, because now it was time to operate it. Besides the bad action, the conclusion did not make sense, because while the story builds up how little steam it has to the climax, which is Igor getting an arborescent arrow in the head and the rest of his crazy friends who are killed, he's been twice again to kill the "good guys" left. The film does not provide any explanation for this, just telling the spectator that Igor has escaped The Bottom Line is not to waste time watching this movie. I wish I could come back to the moments when I lost sight of this.
