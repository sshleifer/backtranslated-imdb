This is a complete and absolute garbage, a good example of BAD, this can not be appealing to anyone, not even for b-film fans. Do not repeat, DO NOT waste the precious time of your life on this piece of garbage. Evil acts, directs evil, horrible (but I mean very terrible) scenario, and the complete lack of an idea of ​​what kind of entertainment (of any form) it is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could pay almost someone to take it. Burning would not be enough for what this movie made me. I like b films, killer toys, strange lagoon monsters, but this is not nearly close. Do you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Even. A simple old pathetic.
