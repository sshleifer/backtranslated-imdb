This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (at least the Italian version doubled). If you like garbage ... true garbage, try it; but beware: this is not a kind of "so bad is good". By its inexpensive, it might even look like a porn, but, believe me, if you are looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in the store! I'm telling you that, because filming, action, plotting, absolutely uninspired and unconvincing dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are those they stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) They will bore you in a tight, a few minutes and the "happy end" is absolutely revolting! I give it a star: half for the sudden shot on the back scene, after the monologue "victim's eyes" (stolen from 8MM) and half for the sexy bodies of mother and daughter (who failed to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
