<br /> <br /> The worst. Movie. Ever. What was the purpose of filming this remake (apart from turning it into 90-minute news material for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombie * running * ??? I think the director has never watched the original "Dead" movies, which show rigid creatures (from rigor mortis) that mix / wander to live prey. And how exactly did the survivors know the boat in the port belonged to Steve recently deceased? 1/10
