Every time there comes a movie along which he knocks me down and reminds me that my taste in the movies I'm looking for is not always impeccable. Normally, I would also prevent it, but I was mistaken for some brilliant reviews and pedigree Rohmer. There is an initial and interesting novelty for the production where Rohmer basically overlaps the actors on painted (digital), the paintings of revolution in the era of France. This drains quickly and becomes as interesting as watching dry paint on a scene of the number scraps. What's left is a boring and tangled film about 18th-century aristocrats in France. None of the characters is appealing or sympathetic. The rhythm is so troubled, the dialogue is so hard, and the suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer, that I have not gotten to care for him on his head, who has mastered who or what should have been the devil of the revolution. The film would have benefited greatly from some appearances of emotional training and a music score (finally, there is a very good classical music). Despite being so "talky," the film behaves like a silent film, and the worst kind of film in this film, a boring and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the best-known French historians will find everything they can do from this film because the dose seems to paint well-known events from a new angle (Lady is English and a regalist). Otherwise, avoid this companion at any cost, unless you suffer from insomnia (I have dropped twice).
