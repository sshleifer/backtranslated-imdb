The "real" story of a late monster that occurs when an American industrial plant starts polluting the waters. A funny film, though not very good, has many people who try to get the monster and find out what's going on, but not in a complete way. Give him points because he has given us a giant monster that he has clearly built to scale for some scenes, but he takes something because it looks like a riskless puppy. A funny exploitative movie, which is pleasantly bad in the right frame of mind. (My only complaint is that the footage used to launch Elvira is so poor that it seems to be a copy of the well-used video tape that went through her first 20 years ago.)
