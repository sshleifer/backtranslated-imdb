Left Behind is an incredible loss of over $ 17 million. The act is weak and uninspired, the story is even weaker. The public is asked to believe the totally ridiculous and often ridiculous line of plot, and not to give anything in return for its good faith. Not only does the film behave badly and scribbly, but it is severely devoid of all the technical areas of the film. The production project does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are completely irregular and flat. Light and general continuity are inexplicably awful; even when compared to one-tenths of the budget. However, none of this matters in the fact that millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film because it is a state of health and a religious inclination; and who can blame them. However, it is regrettable that they will be forced to accept third-person amateur films.
