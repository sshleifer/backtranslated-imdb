I can not say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (just like the current ratings here). I rented this thing two years ago and I totally regret it. I tried / tried / liked it by tracking it twice, but I could not. I can say for sure that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever again. And I'm not one that destroys a movie, but I really think it was terrible. It was not even funny. The only pieces I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie has destroyed both me and Jack Black and Ben Stiller. All I can think of when I see one of their movies now is a terrible movie and reminded me that I do not lose my money. Amy Poehler is so annoying. Overall, well, I think you understand. The stars are for Walken, by the way.
