European Vacation (aka National Vacation Lampoon's European) is the poorest of holiday films (the first and third highest films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with a very stupid dialogue. This makes the rhythm suffer, with funny jokes. Specifically, what really makes this movie suffer is that "jokes" as they are, are just stuck together in a cobbled-together script), rather than serving a central plot just like the other 3 movies have . Well, they can not win all of them. 4 out of 10.
