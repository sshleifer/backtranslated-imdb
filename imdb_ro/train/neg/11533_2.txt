If the derivative and predictable kidnapping-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you are in a rare treatment ... Do not call me, so I could not find one thing to redeem this strange story. It seems that something came out of the 1980s, a different age when it was directly to the movie. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a poor screenplay and a boring script. But what does Gillian Anderson do to get involved in such a movie after the brightness of his performance as Lady Locklock in BBC TV adaptation at Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by the fact that he witnessed a rape almost and through his work on documentaries, but it is not even an excuse for the bizarre scenario where a pack of rural dogs beat Dyer . I do not think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can not understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is it really the best thing you can do? What will British independent filming make of your artistic judgment? It's a big stain on both your reputation. Listen carefully: Can you hear thousands of fans of independent British movies crying in despair?
