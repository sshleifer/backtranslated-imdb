A bunch of women who can not stand around, talk, smoke. They have another woman in a wheelchair that they hide because it is deformed and sometimes kills someone to feed this person with human flesh, which really looks like a bacon bought by the store, which they They clothed by sticking plastic fingers. We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloody sheet. I can not eat a sheet of Spam with a sheet because of that. Just the thought of covering Spam with a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic form brought about by trying to pass through all of these films. Occasionally, there are random scenes of a guy who "hunts" them by torturing a guy he tied to a chair. Why he got this guy and connected to Sit-On-The-Couch sisters never explains. There are also scenes of "superhuman" guys. He makes blood and fists through a wall, but who is or is wrong with him is neither explained nor tied to the story. There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to look at boring people to talk deeply about anything while you sit around and eat bacon and smoke, then it's 90 minutes, except, except in a scene where you put it eat a corner of the street random scenes, absolutely nothing is not happening. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you see them move something, including the deformed sister, when they move to their new apartment. It's one of the few times that I'm not sitting on a couch or sitting in bed.
