An appealing girl witnesses a murder and becomes the next target of the murderer. Director Brian De Palma is really talkative: his room revolves around the corners of a museum (after a long time spent over a painting of an ape), divides on screen for artistic purposes new on split screen), where two characters simultaneously watch a TV program about transsexuals and carry out their final (final) final during a rainstorm. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and give back anything substantial. Much of the acting (except young Keith Gordon) is mediocre, and the (second) final is a rip-off of his own "Carrie" in Palma - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of the dirty deeds behaves like a Hitchcock doll, not a tribute. Stylish in a cool cold, the final results are distinctly semi-finished. ** from ****
