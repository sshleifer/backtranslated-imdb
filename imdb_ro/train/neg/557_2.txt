It's hard to believe, after we wait for 14 years, we'll end up with this cinematic garbage. The original was a dark, dark, thriller that won the "worship" status of the cinematography, directed by Paul Verhoeven. This movie adds nothing, offers nothing, and finally ends in the big box of unsuccessful sequences. The opening sequence would have triggered an interesting set of land developments using a talented and capable distribution. Unfortunately, we are treated to a 90-minute dissertation in Catherine Tramell's self-indulgent life ... or Sharon Stone. Eventually a combination of the two. If the desire is also to see a continuation of the amazing sexual challenge as in "B.S.1", forget it. You come up with pornographic boredom, which ultimately claims the old saying that a woman may be more appealing in clothes than outside her. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling roam around her in skivvies, by 1966 GEORGY GIRL, when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented and adept at keeping it even here. If you are a real fan of cinema then you have to watch this movie and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you can wait for release of the DVD in the "evaluated" version, the "unrated" version, the "collectors" edition or the "supreme" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with "Instinct 3" Stone will be 62 years old, and no one really cares.
