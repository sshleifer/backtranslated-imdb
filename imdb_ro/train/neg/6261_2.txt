A couple moves into their dream home, not knowing that he and his neighbors were built on a land formerly used as a cemetery. It is said that the film is based on a true story, although how much it should be true is not revealed. The plot is not unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short period of time, they face various supernatural phenomena: they range from disturbing mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter to laughing toilets, which continue to flush and the garage doors are out of control. There is not much depth: once it was established that the land was used as a graveyard, we no longer learn anything. The plot does not seem to develop. Characters are not particularly well-drawn or memorable, nor the special atmosphere. The movie may be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.
