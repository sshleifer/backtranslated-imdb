SciFi had some luck bad luck, making lately quality movies (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to rely on the great Beowulf epic, but he deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that TV commercials might call him "a chic movie by Christopher Lambert." I did not expect it to be as precise as a full Hollywood production, but I nevertheless expected that "artistic integrity" would not interfere with the real story (even if a bit was changed to make a two-hour storyboard flowing beautiful in the time slots allocated). The director and the producers have an idea of ​​what they were doing (did a research on this?). Obviously, no, as it can be said from the massive headbands that bears Beowulf and his crew (except the boy). A major problem, however, was Grendel's appearance if Beowulf would have to fight him, should not have had a height of sixteen feet and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death row was also devoid of any kind? In my opinion, the one in the epic was, in fact, better than junkul on the stage; for example: Grendel should have pulled his arm from the Beowulf base? not cut on the forearm after it was put on fire by an arrow that explodes from a crossbow that seems to weigh 300 kg! And Grendel's mother made her combine with the dragon at the end of the epoch, where he eventually dies when he gives up his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was the goose? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic does not exist, because there really is not one (other than the character names). The only way I could recommend this movie is if you liked the film Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I do not recommend to look at them either.
