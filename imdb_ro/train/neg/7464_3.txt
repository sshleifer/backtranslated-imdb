I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after I watched for half an hour and suggested to think someone to look at herself before removing the disc from the casing. I like Mafia films both tragic and comic, but Corky Romano can only describe her as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. The problem is that Corky Romano is trying too much to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse for Chris Kattan (Corky) moving from scene to stage. Corky himself is completely superimposed and has no subtlety or credulity - all his strange manners come in contradictory - Chris Kattan is clearly "acting" rather than assume a role - you instantly beat the story. Each scene is completely predictable, the "comedy event" that will appear on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies like Mr Bean, the disasters caused by the title character are fun, because you can empathize with the characters' motivations and the initial event, and the character's ending is not telegraphed. However, Corky gives the feeling that he is deliberately mistaken in a desperate attempt to attract a laugh from the audience. If Chris did not play a foreign character (who does not really connect with the other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except to try to attract laughter) and comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotyped - all jokes seemed too familiar) this movie could have been tracked. But it is not. You do not look at him.
