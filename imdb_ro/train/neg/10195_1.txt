The writer / director of this film obviously knows nothing about the film. I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced by a monkey, because each seen was either too dark or hottest hot spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very dimensional. For someone who said that this movie was made for poker fans and not for movie fans, someone joking about themselves (perhaps the writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money hates this project. To enter a casino and play a few hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your day job. And if he plays poker, then you have to be hurt.
