This movie was badly written, it was badly and very predictable. It was a very low budget and I understand why it was never released and went straight to the movie. It was not even fun, it was a complete disaster and I would have liked to get 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were horrible, along with the plot that had holes so large that you could drive a poppy truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing - what a stretch! Go over this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes in the mind, which is better than that. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
