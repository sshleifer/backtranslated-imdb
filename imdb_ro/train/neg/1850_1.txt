Director Ron Atkins is crazy. This very low-budget movie chronicles a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a job that receives a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend. He begins to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What begins as a ball-to-wall movie, it's good, but it's very fast. I'm more inclined towards the incompetent. It's hard to forget once. It's like Tom Green ever made a horror movie. My Grade: B Candy Eye: Laurie Farwell gets completely nude; Jasmin Putnam shows breasts and bush <br /> <br /> Anti-eye eye candy: seeing John completely empty again
