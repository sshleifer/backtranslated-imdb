I looked at this film and I was hoping for something to improve all the time. What's so great with a guy without emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex emotion for anyone other than his son. Yeah, I know that's why his son is the only one that makes him lose his temper (if you can tell him), I understand. Characters are undeveloped, relationships are not giving enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, she talks about how her death really has gone wrong because they were so close? Logical synaps abound in this movie. It's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene in which he "loses his temper" is the same as when Little Bill lends his wife to the face (or lack thereof) expression. Yes, William H. Macy is good in portraying a man without emotion - he was there, do it - can you say Magnolia? This film not only did not have emotions, it lacked substance, developed characters and a plot. And I certainly do not miss the recommendation. <br /> <br />
