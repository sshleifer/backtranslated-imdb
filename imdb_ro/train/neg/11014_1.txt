This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This is said quite a bit, given some of the choices we made in movie rentals. I took this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it. The topless scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was as fun as having bat sticks led under my feet while being forced to listen to Roseanne to play Big Spender. "are stupid and consist of the worst kind of humor in the teen bath and in the dressing room gangs and it's so obvious (and poor) of The Kentucky Fried Film that you'll be asked for Big Jim Slade to collapse through the wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince's offer" (whoever it is). If you're not a masochist, avoid this pile of rubbish.
