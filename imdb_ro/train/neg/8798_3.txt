I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story. This is not the case in this movie. It's a series of cohabiting coins. There are scenes of a person who collects pineapple boxes. A woman with a blond wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman is shooting at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never know why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another cocky woman who neatly cleanses a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food community where Mamas & Papas "California Dreaming" is overlapping (I liked the song). Dialogue specifically refers to food (pineapple, chef's salad, and beverage ordering). I suppose most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed. There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is simply a love story - it's not like that. I only wonder why I did not hit Fast-forward. Did I still expect anything significant to happen? not. Perhaps it is the only comfort for this movie - the scenes have changed so quickly that it cheated on you assuming it would be a revelation for all the nonsense.
