A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, overthrow in a late storm. I'm running away from them, but I'm fast tracking the ways with the police just looking for a terrorist. Of course the police confused the gang of terrorists, the real terrorist escaped, and the thieves are forced to flee in a small diving from a bar, taking hostages without knowing why the police intend to catch them. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? Incredible? Absolute. And down the hill from there. Spacey gained a good talent talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but all are wasted. Especially because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all that they do for the rest of the movie is argued. Endlessly and pointlessly. Long before the end of the movie, you stopped playing with what happened to them.
