I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "in part" because most of her films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the later category. This film suffers from the same fundamental issues as Miyazaki's recent "Castle's Moving Castle". An intriguing premise is set up, but then reduced to a little more than a background for some unknown events that serve only to confuse the plot, rather than to explain it. The first third of the film reveals the world-apocalyptic post is staged and, in fact, seems to be a very interesting story about to take place. Since then things are going on the hill. The middle part of the film is largely composed of thin ecological propaganda, and the end is heavily destroyed by the dependence on impenetrable spiritism that ruins a large number of animated Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie feels as if someone has stolen every other page in the script before it moves on to the animators. What is left is somewhat amazingly visual (though, unfortunately, the version I saw was a copy of the N-generation with a weak color - which gives birth to the common myth that Nausicaa shows his bare ass when flying) but that does not make sense and eventually left me confused.
