I will not spend too much time and energy on this comment. I just want to add it, because all the comments were so positive that I felt I had to tell people that not everyone was so excited, not to mention intellectually, caused by this attempt to create an exciting cinematic philosophical enigma. Some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but they could not resist the rest. I felt I was shot for the first time again with semi-philosophical conversations with teen colleagues. What an unnecessary attempt to lift Dutch cinema to new heights. I'd rather see Jesus as a Palestinian, without all the pretensions and direct humor, also raise questions about the life and the realities that we create for ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and will never appear.
