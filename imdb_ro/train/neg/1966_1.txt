I was mistaken to see this movie after I read a positive review from another site and the man was p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to take it off the shelf b / c I did not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I thought all my stress would have been paid when I got home and saw the movie b / c the review I read the film was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you can get through the first hour of the movie, then in luck! b / c is not until then the film turns into a horror. do not bother with this, you better look "dankness falls"
