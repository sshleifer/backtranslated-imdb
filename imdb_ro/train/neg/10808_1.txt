I was given Kazaam's book version for the 8th birthday, and people always say that book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least the movie is over soon. Taking this is terrible, what I expected from a Shaq movie that plays a brilliant magician that springs from an old ghetto blaster probably a good reason for being caught there). The child in the movie that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor. He is harassed by the children in the neighborhood, whom I do not blame for being a small bag. The story is just stupid and extremely clich√©. About a boy whose father always works and never around finds a new friend to make his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father. Even at the age of eight I thought it was a bad idea. It is a surprise that anyone who has worked on this film has had a career by section because it is an embarrassment and should never have been done. I could walk even more about how this movie is shit, but you should already know just by reading the plot.
