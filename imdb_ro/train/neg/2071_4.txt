I had two reasons to look at this wizard when it was broadcast yesterday on Danish television. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. It looked gorgeous. Secondly, by reading the film, I had the impression that it contained absurd humor, different from what is found in Philippe de Broca's films. However, I was disappointed with sadness. I've found the predictable jokes (apart from a few witty remarks about the war), and the characters are completely unidimensional. Also, action scenes were performed in a strange, mechanical and uninspired way, without a sense of drama. I looked to the end, but I got bored very quickly and stayed there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
