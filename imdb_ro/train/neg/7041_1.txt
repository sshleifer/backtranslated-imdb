What else can you say about this movie, except that it's terrible. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see this, but that's it, but their talents are wasted in this junk. I think they used a double some of Adam's scenes, such as when he runs because he does not, you can see her face. If Adam was embarrassed to be in the Zombie Nightmare, just think of what you must have felt about appearing in it ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but still, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (see Mystery Science Theater 3000 first and last version) compared to it. The band is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors. A rip-off of The Wild One with Marlon Brando of course. Tina looks amazing though. I hope she and Adam got a good salary! Pass!
