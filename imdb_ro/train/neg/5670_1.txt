The only reason why "The Norliss Tapes" deserve ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Apart from getting to Angie Baby in a show of "Police Woman," there's nothing to be seen here. <br /> <br /> SINOZA: <br /> <br /> *** MINI SPOILERS ** David Norliss is used to write a book about the supernatural. One day mysteriously disappears after he phoned his editor and suggested that he came across something that put him in danger. The whole series for which this miserable pilot was written was intended to be a series of flashbacks through the Norliss boxes - a set of audio cassettes the writer recorded while investigating supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before buying an old Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the horse will give him immortality after death. Soon we find that the ring itself does not give immortality. Instead, it only reanimates the body of the sculptor, allowing him to get out of his crypt so that he can run into the city, draining cuddly girls from all their blood. <br /> <br /> With yellow eyes, yellow eyes and wailing from ARRHHHHHHH You have not heard since you watched the latest Scooby Doo cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) on a dark night. She escapes and, through mutual knowledge, she contacts Norliss to assist her in solving the mystery behind her husband's re-emergence on her property. So this guy is a vampire? There is no vampire in this story, despite what you have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. How? I do not know. I saw him attacking him, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of his immortal attempt. It seems that the revived sculptor will be left to live forever if he builds a life-sized statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. Once finished, Sargoth plans to live in the statue, using it as a gateway to our world. FINAL ANALYSIS: "Norliss tapes" were not taken as a series for a very good reason ... it was garbage. As you can see from my summary, the story is a pale, ill-conceived misery. The actor and the dialogue offer nothing better. He is not even a contestant for a "So bad is good" award. Sometimes, bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground misconduct about the great merits of The Norliss Tapes, I was very excited to find it on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I did not set up for the fall. After visiting this thought for the first time two days ago, I can only assume that any applause you have heard so far from other IMDB commentators comes from those who review the show based on poor memories and the nostalgia of young people. Or maybe they are just loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In any case, they gave you misleading reviews about Norliss Tables. Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
