Filmed in documentary style, but you can say pretty well that the participants were trained. A newly divorced filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees a chance to enrich his love life and enter the biz movie at the same time. He plans to make a documentary about finding love by shooting twenty data, including ramifications. Comedy is the best; the rest is bad after a mistake. Also attended were Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and Elisabeth Wagner. Trying for credibility, Tia Carrere is a cameo. This will be enough as a manual on how not to get a satisfactory date.
