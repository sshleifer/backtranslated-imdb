This is not one of those reviews about special effects or poor quality or data technologies, problems that only the sweetest people might think of, but rather a review of the story, about which most of us are really interested . > <br /> The plot refers to a combination of members of NATO's Second World War and two civilians (the hero and the heroine) who are pushed on a German U boat and end up in a wild country dinosaurs. /> <br /> Handling is not so bad by film standards, and we know from the scene that realism will not be high. What movies like this need are credible and pleasant characters, along with some appearance of reason in action. This movie does not have both. For a maximum length movie, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are barely visited. McClure's hero is beyond "routine," and it makes little sense in any age. The woman seems to seek a response to an enigma about the land of the dinosaurs they entered, but the enigma is not much of an enigma, and we might be less interested in it. A lot of failure in a movie that should have been better, even for its time.
