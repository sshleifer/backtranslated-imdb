Overrated and only for those 20-year-olds wearing colorful, thicker glasses, who never saw it first because they were young. Horrible animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 1980s, the Roman treasure of a TOY puzzle (that is, it is not the absurd, the pretentious and the child who allies its "action figurine for collectors") sold on the back of a cartoon and other accessories that bought TOY when "current" children were in the "84" - "87" period. It became worship because of the same adults who are immature to release their memories. Avoid.
