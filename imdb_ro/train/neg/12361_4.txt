I have seen this recent Woody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and I'm making a point to try to see everything he does, though the reviews of this film have made me wait for a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confusing film that can not decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the crisis in the middle of feminine life. She fails to all three. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a middle-aged woman who has been married in great wealth and lives a deluxe life without a goal with her pretty boring husband and her two young children. The concept of banal plot is enriched with such implausibility as an old Chinese healer that makes it invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former boyfriend (flying over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, what about a more prosaic, like a saxophone player? I was never sure what this mixture was trying to say. There is only a handful of really fun moments in the movie and the end is a truly absurd touch of Pollyanna. Instead, rent "crimes and crimes", a superb movie made in the combination of comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morality. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan."
