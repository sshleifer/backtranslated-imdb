It seems to me at first an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in an exciting Madrid nowadays, but it is nothing of this, it is actually an interesting film for future movie directors who learn about what to do to make a movie, (even though the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the amount of $ 3.00 spent to watch this movie, the act is terrible and it seems the actors just waited to finish the day, go home, is boring, poor and bad, does not spend time or money on this movie.
