This starts with sorrow, what happens to the three women who behave like high school girls giggling with endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate for the one who tells the story of the best man and then aggravate - = - alert spoiler = - = what Andie's character falls for the young organ player who was a 14 year old student (is the head of an English school, believe it or not) just to destroy it because of her bitch - girlfriend from hell. .. and then from there, it is basically undetectable: she forgives her "boyfriend" and has the baby's love of the organ and the 3 women end up as they start, drink more gin and smoke more cigarettes bla bla bla . Andie's character throws caramel chocolate in the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
