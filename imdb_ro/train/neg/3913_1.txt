This movie is a good example of ruining a book in 109 minutes. Except for the characters' names, the film looks very little like the book. A book of Latin characters that are strong and are mostly represented by non-Latinos. There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And to erase a complete generation is inexplicable. Isabel Allende wrote a strong book and the book is what should be read!
