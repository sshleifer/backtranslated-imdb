Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this film, despite the fact that Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach are much larger than her. Basically, this is a bit of spin on the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays a girl who feels bad because a stranger is pursued by soldiers and takes her creature runaway in her very sexy disguise. A bit of nudity and partial nudity, an unnecessary sexual scene all feature along the way. The film is shot through some obvious sets and jokes running about being photographed. I loved Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and had a really cold death scene. It was quite obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be picked up and the movie would have been pretty nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed to Eggert.
