RKS films have always been commercial films that matched the 90's, from GHAYAL, DAMINI. His latest KHAKEE movies were watched FAMILY was bad Film is a decent movie but it might be better The problem lies in the fact that there are plenty of old-fashioned clich√©s thrown in and many scenes are out too filmed and long <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan character is shown very well but his character becomes heroic that could be subtle < > <br /> The long retrospective could be avoided because the fairs are simply long Even the game on the street in the second half seems too simplistic and it is not a solution The message is well removed <br /> <br /> The direction of to RKS is decent although it may be better Music is ok Ajay Devgan looks good side and is at ease playing his role most of the times he looks sick at ease in bright scenes He excels in dramas Vidya excels in front of the media scene Pankaj has an unfinished definite role and too movies he excels in the role of Darshan Jariwala as an elder smile, the rest are fine
