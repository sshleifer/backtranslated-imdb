A boiler if I ever saw one. A thriller featuring "A Time to Kill," "Laughter of Lambs," even a reversed "In the Heat of the Night," with a small reverse crime, a "Train Strangles" thrown in, fails where all the above , largely succeeded. That is, in the delivery of emotions. The land seems to be condensed from a larger book, which makes the evolution of the plot obvious and uninterested, while the direction is devoid of rhythm and speed. To resist any kudos, a series of important things had to be taken seriously and here too, they fail. Connery is clearly slowing down at his age, barely bothering with his American accent and, in addition, seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and his father's children. He even has a father in law who looks younger than he. Laurence Fishburne has just the chance to live his role and you're confused from the very beginning if he's a bad guy or a good boy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they're confused here. The rest of the game is only an average of a reasonable distribution in the subscribed stereotyped roles. Also, the climax succeeded to roll, leaving me firmly rooted behind, not as the goal should be, the front edge of my chair. The mediocre Hollywood neglected movie is safe.
