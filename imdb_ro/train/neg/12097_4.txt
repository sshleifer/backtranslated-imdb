I did not really hope too much when I went to see this. After I left JasonX with some friends, I was hoping to have a similar experience here. Unfortunately, the movie took too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? I am sorry that. There's a legion of Ft13 movies that covers it anyway. At the end of the day, he's a serial killer, I'm not going to feel that nice. Freddy was by far the most exciting aspect of the film with hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately there were few and far between and until the end of the film, it degenerated into an evil episode of celebrity legacy ... no It's just funny. <br /> <br />
