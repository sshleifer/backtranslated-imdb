Personally, while I am able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy to some extent even the most silly carp. You know, those moments when you just want to sit there and watch a horrible cutter-cutter movie to kill the time. This is the only movie I really remember closing in the middle and I have absolutely no intention of turning back to finish it. The plot was so controversial and predictable, I turned to what the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at that). The actors were horrible, I saw better action in the middle school songs. Even the cuts of the scene were bad, the flow was wrong. This movie is like a parody that forgot the fun.
