Without reaffirming what has been said above about this movie, I would like to add that we were waiting to watch this movie ... the location and the work of excellent director Michael Winterbottom, etc. He had a vague shadow of Do not look at the story from the beginning. A stay in different surroundings (again in Italy) to lessen the suffering of the loss ... or maybe I have seen it? So, so I stayed there waiting for the story to unfold and spin what we expect to happen with this family in a European foreign country ... and I sat there and sat there ... and guess what ? nothing is happening! and I do not want to say anything! You are not even given the chance to enter characters that are so dimensional and empty. You are led to believe in the rhythm of the film that something will happen to turn the entire movie on his head ... The brother of the greatest flirting with the local Vespa boys had a great chance to make the film in another direction, the young daughters of her dead mother have become a pointless and pointless exercise, fathers try to be seduced by one of his students feeling ridiculous in view of his age. It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last moment to eliminate any thought on the story and went to paring it to an absolute minimum without any effect. When credits start to roll (unexpectedly), you can only help yourself to feel robbed of the time you spent, seeing the rubbish pile.
