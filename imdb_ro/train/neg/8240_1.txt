Do not waste your time watching this! If you do not want to study it for all the wrong things you should not do to make a good movie. I'm not one who usually reviews a movie, but that's personal. I've lost precious time that I can not give him back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching these nonsense. If it were a student project, I should have said not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after which it gets annoying. cry, bad audio, bad movie (a good man could have done much better). and yes, what is the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? We hoped it would improve, but it is not. How the hell did it deserve? 2 is more correct, but 1 to waste my time! I told my peace.
