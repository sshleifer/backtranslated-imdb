I really like movies with slasher, but this is really terrible. The act is blades, the script is bad and the atmosphere is non-existent. The plot is the following: a deformed gardener, Charlie Puckett, slaughters people in a small American city. That's good - this is the script. Very original, eh! "Night brings Charlie" is not quite bad - if the movie is not scary, at least it should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap piece of garbage at all costs. If you want to see some good movies, please check "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - do not waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage.
