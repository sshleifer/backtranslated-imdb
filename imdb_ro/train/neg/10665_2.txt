About three minutes in this, I began to redirect quickly, pausing only during nudity (why bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I finished, and I would have liked to get my money out of the rental shop. People who write these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on, writers - the bad guys always get into the car with the remote control of the good! This is how it was made from the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insults to the injury, "twisting" at the end was so formal that it could have come from any action film written over the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should focus on real movies. This movie is just a waste of time - Run! Run!
