Following a car accident, a crazy scientist (Jason Evers) keeps the head of his fiancee (Virgina Leith) alive. Then he continues to go looking for the perfect body to do it again. Pretty blades around, nothing redeeming here. Also in the distribution are Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Shari and Bruce Brighton. Someone should have helped him get him out of the mess. Let him die.
