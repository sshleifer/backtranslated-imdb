SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie would have seemed cool ... if you had never seen a * good * ninja * movie. Cheesy's music of the 80s ... dialogue with cheeses ... cheese-making ... and neighboring martial arts. The hottest scene is in the beginning ... with an elderly Chuck Connors who sings golf on a beach ... more ninja dressed in black tries to sneak on him and seems to have too much intention to hit the ball .. suddenly gets into the golf bag and ... naw, I will not spoil it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about stolen video tapes or something like that. A bunch of dim-bulb caucasian heroes are trained in the ways ninja is "just a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight better after training than before ... oh well, the movie moves pretty well. Battle scenes may not be great, but they are abundant ... and outdated sound effects are good for some chuckles.
