I have seen today most of my "Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC New York Film Festival and had to leave the theater because of the nausea that occurred in me. I've seen Bollywood movies and I've seen Bollywood movie satire. This movie could not decide which one they wanted to be, so it came to be a joke in itself. He seems to have been copied freely from films such as Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling and what a greedy, lazy job. How can Bollywood ever be worsened by his determination to stick to the scriptures used everywhere? There is no one to bring millions of real and fascinating stories that surely exist and meet in the country of a billion people? Smart car driver, cow on the street, free scenes of foreign locations, unnecessary scenes in the streets of Mumbai, are all there. Every possible cliche on India has been faithfully included. So hard to predict. Ugh !!! Current performances are poor on board, with the exception of Neha Dubey, talented and beautiful. He wonders why he would choose such a project.
