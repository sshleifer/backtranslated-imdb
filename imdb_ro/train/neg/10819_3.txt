I agree with one of the other commentators about good story and good actors, but it does not match and I would say they have rushed. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as it was in school. But I felt you need to know Jane Eyre's story when you follow him, because the bits are left out and hence does not make sense. For example, Jane & Rochester did not talk much and suddenly proposes marriage! Actors have no time to let the audience know how their character feels about every thing that happens in the story. The actors are good, but they are not given enough time to make this story righteous. I'm sorry to say, but I did not really like this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott is Jane Eyre's favorite film, but you should check the BBC version of the 1983 series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton in the two main roles. I like so much that I keep track of it regularly. There is an abridged version that lasts 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
