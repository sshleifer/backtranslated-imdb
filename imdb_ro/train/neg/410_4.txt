Unfortunately, one of the best efforts made yet in the field of special effects has been made completely useless, being placed alongside a cumbersome, stupid, and just useless plot and an inappropriate, cluttered scenario. Hollow Man is a pretty futile movie. Virtually everything that has been seen here has been made to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the tree!) - with the only truly intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. However, it is just the same special effect done again and again, and to the end of the movie, which was also done to death. We hoped, before watching the Hollow Man, that the theme of the invisible man, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something new and more exciting. It's not like that. Not long before the film turns into a well-known blood bath and a lot of ineffective histrionics - the pile of clich√©s hurries so fast it's almost impressive. Besides all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty futile job, and the distribution in support of her tries hard to do the best. Good points could be an acceptable score for Jerry Goldsmith (but no competition for his bigger efforts), a rather interesting use of thermal imaging and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects push the merlow Hollow Man into a single notch. <br /> 4/10
