Normally, I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so painful that it seems to me. I headed for the terribly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughing at the moments that needed to be tense. Indeed, most of the audience seemed rather bored and spoken even at the "tightest" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald was noted as the only interpretation of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "twisting" at the end was not. I heard he said the movie did not take seriously; but I have found little evidence about it in the movie. It should have been left cut on the floor of the room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
