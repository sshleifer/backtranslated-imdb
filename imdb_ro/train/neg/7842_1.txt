He was accidentally caught on a t.v. showing - and could hardly believe how terrible the experience was. By comparison, the original "A Horse Monk" was mandatory because it kept the interest entirely. But this piece of nonsense - the words do not succeed. It was bad enough to have a "story" presented with the full impact of a loaf of bread, but this error was amplified by the obvious lack of subtitles along whenever she spoke the so-called "Sioux." For reasons of kindness, filmmakers have not found enough North American Indians who were also actors and close actors to interpret the "Indians" in this farrago instead of the narratives they actually used? I also realized that Richard Harris looked around the rural landscape at the obvious request of the director sitting right behind the room, telling him to run and jump from point unnecessary from point B to point B useless, just to shoot and minutes. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
