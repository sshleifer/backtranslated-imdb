This movie is not worth your time. His trust in New Age mysticism serves as her only distraction of interest. The plot is one that has been recycled many times. I was just urged to spend time commenting when I noticed that some have tried to support the reputation of this nonsense. Their motivation and objectivity are dubious as it encourages you not to look at the mistakes of the film, but to the well-intentioned message of the New Age consciousness. So, should it be good about twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic Fundamentalists to shift into positive film / television ratings that support their views? Despite the poor production or lack of truth in any of its supposed historical bases? I hope not. I'm sure the descendants will come right behind me to say thriving things about this movie, despite the truth.
