This is an insane piece of storytelling. It's about an hour in the movie before having an idea of ​​what should be about it; Characters often murmur inappropriately; actions seem to be unrelated; no one seems to be concerned about who killed the girl; a pair of scary kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; the Irishman is perforated in front of one of his friends for no apparent reason ... to continue to be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-fun element is landscape photography; but anyone could indicate a camera at the Australian edge receiving memorable photos. On the whole - disturbing, incoherent, pretentious - and even disturbing for the loss of so much of the viewer's time.
