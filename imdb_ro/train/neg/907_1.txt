I wrote a review of this movie below after I bought it on DVD and I was very disappointed. I tried to see it again after reading some of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making movies similar to the budget (that is, without budget, shot on digi cam), I am staring at my initial comments. This is a non-budget (and not a particularly good) student project, released on video / DVD to look like an award-winning film (if you read the cover). So cheating the public to think it's not something. I want the money back under the transaction description act! Full gun!
