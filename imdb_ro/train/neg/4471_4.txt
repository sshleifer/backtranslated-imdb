The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes funny sometimes and that it was an appropriate time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is also so annoying that I wanted to push these characters around. This is a kind of movie that is so sweet, it hurts your teeth. Intentions were good, I suppose, but things get extremely tiring when dialogue is SO so difficult. When the two leaders are not together on the screen, this is not bad at all, but you have to be afraid of those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to each other.
