In the glory days of the 90s (the god rests his soul) you could activate the great Central Comedy at any hour of the day and see the greatest comedy show of all time of Saturday Night Live. A glorious show that was, whether it was the original players who were not ready for the first years, or the second golden age of SNL with the seas - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then , everything went to hell. I was first exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I was probably going through the shock. How could such a show surrender for so long? There are so many horrendous flaws. I suppose I'm going to start writing. Writing is often terrible. There is nothing more than the kindergarten's humor. Distribution, for the most part, is devoid of talent. There are some sketches I have enjoyed, such as some of Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents on the show, such as the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just a comedian. Although there are some rare moments of ha ha, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible anger populated by stingy idiots. Miss this.
