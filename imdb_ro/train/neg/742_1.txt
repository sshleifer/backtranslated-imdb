If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I would like to know where the money came from. A monkey could do better with the effects of CGI, then it was scattered for three hours on this terrible garbage, although I must admit that the cars and the Martians would indeed have really shown themselves in an original game since the mid- 90, had a game ever been made. What makes me crazy is where the money went? Pendragon films could have made a wonderful movie with old-fashioned models and video surveillance cameras controlled by George Lucas around 1975-83, and actors who actually show they care about what they do (or ruin in this case) 20 million. This is possibly the worst movie ever made! I would prefer to sit on a 24-hour repeated visit to Ishtar than to watch this movie again. I hated them completely! I regret it. I say this is the best movie made because unlike other bad movies such as Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus conquers the Martians, these are so bad movies that you have a special place in their heart for them, you love them. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD library for that. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money for the film was spent on the beverage and other vices for distribution and crew. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
