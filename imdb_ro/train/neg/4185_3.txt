I give this movie a 3 movie because it's worse than the worship movies that deserve a good 2. Does it make sense to you? Well, you do not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, an incredibly idiotic plot, where space cowboy (complete with cowboy hats) is struggling with a space race of moronic vampires. than this? The only good thing in this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning beauty in Norway. God, I'd like Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers no longer to accept stupid roles in dumb movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from a lot of movies, he acted in 164 movies this time! It's true that rarely had a major role, but still!
