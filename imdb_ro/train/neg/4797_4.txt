After Maurepot Vic Moretti (the great late Anthony Franciosa) kills the lady who cheated on Derek, their new Vietnamese driver / veteran, and blames the poor guy, Derek is in prison where he has to fight a guardian corrupt Vic prisoner who runs the prison, and, oh, do the illegal experiments by a CIA murderer (great gentleman and first director John Saxon) to turn more prisoners into invincible super-human zombies. Of course things are out of hand and it is up to Derek and the rest of the prisoners to save the day after the infected prisoners get the prison. John Saxon is a talented and talented actor, as Saxon director is ... a very talented actor. Saying that this movie (John's only directorial output so far) does not have a certain visual flair would be a little understatement. However, the film is not entirely worthless. Dialogue, while idiot, is bad enough to be humorous at times. Unfortunately, this is not enough for the film to go down only this, and it will take forever for the film to even begin its own film (which is pretty late in the film). As such, the most I can recommend this movie is to say that if you are a fan of Saxon (which are indeed), it's worth a watch, you just have to go with low expectations and you should be fine.
