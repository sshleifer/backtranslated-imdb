I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless blistering piece (believe me, negative doubts are needed here - it's so bad). This film has been in difficulty since the opening of credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the composer. The musical numbers are too long and none are good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent song, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would have gladly worn the chains worn by Scrooge in the bizarre sequence of film hell, rather than reuniting myself again through this insult to the film musicals. The only fun part of this film (completely unintentional) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a white, blue powder suit, Guinness enters his scenes in an attempt to make him look like he's floating like a ghost or showing his total scorn of having to be in this terrible movie. Albert Finney, meanwhile, combines the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his quirky character by Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finley's Scrooge is such a hideous person, it's impossible to believe his transformation. Run away from this abomination of shooting at any price.
