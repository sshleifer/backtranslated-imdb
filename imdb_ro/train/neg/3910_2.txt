Isabel Allende, the magical lyrical novel about three generations of a South American aristocratic family, was vandalized. The gross fury of a film that resulted - largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely incapable of removing the elusive Latin melody of Allende's characters and a Scandinavian royal knife - was so inconvenient in my own skin to the theater for the second time to make sure I did not miss something vital to change my mind. To my disappointment, I did not lose anything. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close, and Vanessa Redgrave could get rid of the set of traps for them by director Bille August. Everyone looked perfectly rigid and resigned as if, as little effort as possible, expected to disappear unnoticed into wonderful sets of times. (Yes, the film was driven by art in one centimeter of his life.) Curiously, the production designer allowed the gaffe to place KFC products prominently in a scene that appeared around 1970 - years before KFC to appear. At that time, it was known as the original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Do you really forgive, on earth, what does the Kentucky Fried Chicken do in a military dictatorship in South America in the 1970s? American fast food chains have not hit South America until the early 1980s. The "House of Spirits" should have been the cinematic event since 1993. Because it was so fake and faithful in its belief in its vague idea about what the novel represented, Miramax had to sell it as an art film. As a result, there was no event or art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have accused of rape.
