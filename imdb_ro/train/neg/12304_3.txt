I watched this movie sometime last week, and I had the biggest laugh I've ever had. The film's film is pretty bad and convoluted in a bad way. The only plus that is found anywhere in the movie is the impressive abs of Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think it is her name) is terrifying as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is brutal, and his character is a twit on all. And as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son is not enough, they throw away unnecessary solos at all times! The end and culmination of this film is absolutely absurd and also ridiculous. Who the hell wants to take the baby to a cone who tried to make you think he was your son and had an incestuous relationship with him?
