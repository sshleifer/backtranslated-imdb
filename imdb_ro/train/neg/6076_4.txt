In FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. It was easy for me to think that Renard had begun as a fan of obsessive frustration to be a psychopath outside the character arc is not the only problem with this scenario - an outbreak of characters (a problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro was supposed to be gorgeous, but it's got a bit flat), for some stretches of film I thought Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story comes back to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think that this should have been more focused on baseball. I'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans initially, but again there are elements that may suggest that they might have if the producers were thinking they should who and what story they should focus on I will admit that I was distracted by the FAN (especially the soundtrack), but it is a very erroneous film, and it should be remembered that in the mid-1990s, the characters were being watched by the Ghost as well as the WOMAN White, steam a long time ago
