My personal vision of hell is stuck in a room without the ability to close my eyes or to block my ears and to have this movie for eternity on every available surface in that room. The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man just starts scratching the surface how ridiculous it is a premise of this film. The most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "suspended disbelief". . . it's impossible to do that in this movie.
