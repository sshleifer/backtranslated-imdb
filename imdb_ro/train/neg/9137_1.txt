What can I say is an exceptional piece of film that should have won an Oscar. A copy must be safely kept in a secure vault for posterity. It should be necessary to watch all high school students around the world. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most brilliant writer / director / producer / chef / babysitter / walmart greeter to admire the world of cinema with his art. Where did I start with this? Every mille of Ben and Arthur was so completely astounding! And Mraovici like Arthur, wow, he's so attractive I'm surprised he did not go for Mr. Universe. I could not help myself during the nude scene. I borrowed this movie to my brother and called me on the phone saying how Arthur's nude scene made him gay. I am absolutely supported, of course, by this film and are nice lessons made in tolerance. Why yesterday I burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in her terrible ashes. Cinema was the best thing about this movie. When the Fed-Ex flew to heaven in the middle of the Vermont palm trees, I cried! Why did I never know they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex before this film. He opened my eyes to a new field of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's school of scenography, action, direction, composition, casting, production, production design and real estate. I just want to say, "Thank you, Mr. Mraovici, thank you for bringing this creation to the world, that we can not pay you enough."
