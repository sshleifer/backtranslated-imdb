- The film opens with a meteor descending into a lake. Not known by locals, an egg dinosaur is also at the base of the lake. The meteor warms the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the eggs that release a dinosaur that continues to terrorize the community. What a total garbage. I do not care about the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's all about the movie that bothers me. The act is atrocious. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. The comic relief is nothing but comic. Logic is nonexistent. Any resemblance between the "scientists" in this film and a real scientist is pure coincidence. I could continue an eternity about the bad aspects of this film, but you get the idea. I think it's pretty safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
