I could not even go to see the film all the way. I can not comment on the story because I did not see the whole movie and the reason why I could not see it was because of the "actors". First of all, they mostly showed only rigid, and I'm sure their scriptures were in their hands just outside the framework - but this is a minor issue. The main issue I have with the actors is not their fault ... is who shot this movie! Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought that throwing people in the age of twenty to play teenagers came out of fashion with a new wave! I can not watch a movie in which one of the first lines, from an elderly man older than me, is "I am 17!" How can anyone take this seriously ????? Do not fall victim to this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this movie could ever give.
