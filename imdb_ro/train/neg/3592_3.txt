For a number of fans, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad at all. But the review of this series can not be based on whether or not the series of fans. The initiative itself is commendable. And creativity. I think there are people with regular jobs and a great enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But doing all these things. Drag all these resources. All this time, and yet all these flaws. First of all it works, and the lines are terrible. For most. Dialogues belong to a 70-year military show, not Star Trek. The Captain (Mr. Squinty) seems to be about to laugh at any time. Most characters read only the lines. Directors should be aware that "replay" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I think the series is made in the "Two Takes Frakes," which directed many of the TNG episodes and movies. I also could not believe that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going deeper into that hypothesis. The greatest concern about the whole project is the quality of the broadcasts. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why did they not have it in decent quality? Using fast, low-resolution time format is a loss of talent. Even 'higres' episodes are considered to be poor quality compared to the standard quality series they are launching. Using the Xvid codec with higher resolution and file size would improve the massive experience. If the troubled band was the problem, installing a torrent tracker would have solved that. We hope the crew decides to delete the series and probably release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project it deserves.
