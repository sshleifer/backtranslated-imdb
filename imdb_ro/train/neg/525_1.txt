I looked over the other comments and I was very amused to find out clearly that only those who actually worked on the film commented. I mean, I like to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and you want to comment, tune it a little. "Groundbreaking" is slightly above the top. This is a college production based on Boston, which does not even reach the level of the most amateur college film. It's what you would expect from a bunch of kids. An action movie fools without too much creativity. It's funny if you're willing to have fun with it. It's not something you'll ever see if you're not a student at Emerson.
