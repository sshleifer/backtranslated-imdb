I went in to see D-War on a whim and very low expectations. The film did not manage to meet them. I do not mind the stories that lie in credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect them to be coherent internally. This film has come from the killer to the killer, without interrupting breathing, all intertwined with special effects that have lagged behind LOTR or even Godzilla. A mystical warrior in Korea, curiously changed into a Caucasian Ancient Cabernet, and appeared as deus ex machina to get the unfortunate protagonists out of their last misery. A special FBI agent who seems to be completely stripped of Korean folklore because of Fed's excellent paranormal division, which has so far not been recommended. Lovers kiss in the deserted beaches where they are excited "I did not want this to happen." A reincarnated pair of Koreans who have long died who "died as star lovers". Mystery pendants, robot-free hordes of soldiers (which owes much to Peter Jackson's orcs), and a snake that has been so wasteful that he laughs that whenever a prey is at hand, something comes to distract him. > The dialogue is terrible, the act of wood and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, boring. However, for me, the crowning moment was the end, after the final, when the music for closing credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa closing "Ran" with a karaoke interpretation of My Way - and let me make it clear that there is no way comparing director Shim with Kurosawa. In short, a self-indulgent, an unclear collection of cliches and insanities that can draw attention to the melodramatic sentiment so prevalent in the popular culture of the Quran, but should not be worth the ticket to any serious film - or even a tireless film . I would suggest that this goes over the cinemas and go directly to the movie, but I'm not even sure it deserves so much.
