It really impresses me that it was done. The director / writer / actor must really be charismatic in reality. I do not think of any other way to pass the screenplay scenario. What I want you to think about is this ... while watching the movies that I felt bad about the actors. It felt as if in a comedy club standing, where the guy dying on his feet and sitting there without enjoying himself, feeling very bad for him to try. I really like to know what the budget is, you suppose it must have been low, because the quality of the film is very poor. I want to write "The jokes did not call me". but the reality is for them to turn to you, you should be the man who wrote them. or a delay. So imagine that in the form of a script ... and this guy got the green light up. That's impressive, is not it?
