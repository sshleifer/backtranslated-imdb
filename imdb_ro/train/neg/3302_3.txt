Swedish action films have evolved over the last few years in something that imitates strengthened American films such as "Heat" but with a low budget. This film follows the same recipe as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough film. The story was seen before, the dialogue feels artificial, and the act is very weak, especially from the main actress. The film attempts to paint a picture of the hard military robbers as a war of war without any remorse, and a female investigator who has completely lost his past problems but at the same time is acting completely rationally. I'm not doing well. The blue photo style does not seem to be fresh or well done in this image. Only very few scenes actually look good. Also, the sound is rather strange and it seems that much of the real dialogue is recorded later. The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although he does not make a compelling portrait of a SWAT leader team, has some really funny lines. Also, the music is pretty good.
