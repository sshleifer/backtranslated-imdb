First of all, let me say the first 20 minutes are wonderful, the monster looks gorgeous and CGI is done in a reasonable way. It's a shame when the rest of the movie is such a disappointment ******** MORE SPOILS ******** <br /> <br /> From the stage we can see that this movie is anti-American, normally this kind of stereotypes do not bother me (we, the British, we get pretty from Hollywood), but here is not subtle about making the Americans dead moron. It goes beyond the point of realism and your left wonders if a Yank raped the mother directors. The scene of betrayal was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts to descend. <br /> <br /> Here we are at the Olympics Olympic medal and I drank the uncle who enters the memorial and start blaming the father for the death of his sons and then hitting him before he starts rolling on the floor crying. Unrealistic connections in a time of crisis! The whole secondary line of the virus is ridiculous. If Americans know there's no virus, why is it wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders the innocence of an innocent brain for nothing, making the Americans look bad (or bad), was not helped by the fact that this guy was cross-eyed for the comic effect. <br /> <> The movie targets monster hunt. Special American and Korean forces are destined to find the creature, though through their movie they are invisible. The only people who hunt the monster in the whole of Korea are the main family and a random tram that finally appears to save the day! Naturally, some US / Korean agents are trying to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> Sister was included in the movie just to make the vital shot at the end. It was cliched, you knew it would happen, but it does worse, it does everything to that side! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that child survive at the end? the monster swam with his head underwater for about 5 minutes! why not the monster eats children first?
