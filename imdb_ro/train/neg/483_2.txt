I do not think the Frenchman could make a bad movie, but I was obviously very wrong. As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title as the starting point; her portrayal of life and her person has little or nothing to do with the true Artemisia Gentileschi. The scenario is horrible - pretentious, steady and vapid - and the rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that too often draws its life by distorting rather than repeating history. Together with a decent design, Valentina Cervi's physical charms are a prime benefit of this film, and it is obvious from the outset that film producers have been aware of this; they do not waste time creating different "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with titillation than with parcel or character development. Unfortunately, the call to see a beautiful girl in a state of premeditated sexual arousal can not and does not support this movie. The actress is unimaginable, and the score is too generic despite an interesting string or second. The cinema is fine and there are some pretty pretty colors, but there are some pretty ridiculous sequences that use distorted lens effects more suited to a 1960s movie than a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often on the body of Artemisia, and too rarely in her paintings. Everything was an almost complete failure. He's not smart enough or good enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and pretentious to work like soft-core pornography. So the French can fail after all!
