An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a charity Charles Bronson goes around to erase the "scum" that has beaten his parents or grandparents or something, and impresses the young joy with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene, she intervenes to stop a rape, and a policeman throws her in jail, so after a couple of cool shower scenes and abortive seduction in jail, she has to take the law into her hands blah bla bla. I think there were many movies like this? The script is a lot better than usual if you can believe that. Mani comes as a kind of showbiz that co-produces his own Death Wish movie with the lead role, and this guy seems sporadic, but the movie is an awkward device. The competent actors would have been wasted on the expensive roles here and would actively undermine the phantasm of DA-incompetent and a judge who must be the manufacturer's uncle.
