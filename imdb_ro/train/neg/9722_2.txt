I liked this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are so immature, selfish, and self-focused. They hurt everyone around them, playing their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but what good are they if there are no characters to connect to or an interesting story line. Should I be happy when these two FINAL psychopaths end their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought that "this should be the best in France" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> As for the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
