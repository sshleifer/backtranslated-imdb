This is the same as the 6th film. The movie is very bad. He does not offer anything in the death department. Unique liners are bad and are something that should not be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes him worth it in time. Characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the sixth but still one of the worst movies in the series. My Rating 2/10
