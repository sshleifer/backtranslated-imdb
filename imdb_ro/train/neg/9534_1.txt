I'm a fan of Best of the Best films. But it was terrible. No wonder I had so hard to find this. I tried 4 video rental shops until I found one with a copy of this movie. The actress was terrible, the plot was a joke and the action was bad too. I miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and the theme that this movie had with the first two films. <br /> <br /> John
