This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I learn French in college and understand the dialogue so that the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say that it is very difficult to empathize with any of the characters described in the film. There is only one professional actor in the distribution and I do not think there are professional directors or writers. Although I rated it 1 in 10, it probably does not deserve such a weak rating. This is just an unnecessary effort to reduce its current rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate assessment because the movie is a true event that is not 100 minutes long that you will never come back. The real shame is that I'm sure a college student is busting his walnuts making a movie twice as good and half as long. However, if you want to join the band that seems to roll around IMDb, you'd better go and give "Lost in Translation" and 10.
