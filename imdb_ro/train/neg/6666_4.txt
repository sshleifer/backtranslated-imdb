I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to ruin this movie - do not worry right from the start, you know something bad will happen - but here is an example of how neglected this movie was. Cowboy and Twig walk on the ridge. Cowboy has a mustache with a handle. Cowboy and Twig entered a shot outside and strolled halfway across the crest. Cowboy is shaved clean all the rest of the movie. Between the fight between the arms and the descent on the mountain, the cowboy has time to shave in the dark on the back of a horse. To be fair, the action of the four main characters is solid.
