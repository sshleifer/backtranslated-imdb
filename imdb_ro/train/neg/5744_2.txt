This movie was horrible, just put. It was so bad that I enrolled at IMDb to warn you of its dangers. I'm a horror film expert myself. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many more. I know the schid. And I know this movie sucks. Three-legged film is made up of scared people running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are swallowed by non-secular lines without emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to accept, the direction collapses. There have been so many small angles; I thought Leif Jonker had a three-legged tripod. He used what I call "Leif Maneuver" a few million times: that is, by subtracting from an object of interest as an amateur. It seems that the movie crew could not get up early enough to shoot a sunrise, so they shot a sunset ... and they played it in the opposite direction. With this lazy direction, you are impressed by the final scene. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes were filmed before the first eighty-five minutes. If you want a good (bad) gorilla movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or "Dead Life" foundation. If you are a schlock boy and look for a challenge, give "Dark" a go. <br /> <br /> Quote the 'Vampire movie: It's time to die!
