The premise of this expected sequel was very good, and after the immense success of the remake I was very honest. The sad truth is that this movie is truly absurd and inept. Situations are bad and beyond reason, and the act is really terrible. This time there are no characters full of love or lively, unlike the remake. Also, gore is not so abundant and when it happens is really bad. Violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that hunts a cannibal mutant family. Surely you expect something different! When I looked at the movies, I wanted my money back. However, this is a clear example of how quickly movies have become messy and show poor quality in all respects. <br /> <br /> A disaster that left remake fans like me. Therefore, continuations are not welcome; at least this film is not as dreadful as the 1985 sequel to the original.
