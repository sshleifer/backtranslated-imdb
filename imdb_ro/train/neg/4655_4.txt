I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial uncertainty. The moments of opening, with a naked woman, and a painter, Diana, on the point of painting her and then sucking her blood to drain so that she could use it for her art to give her the impression that she might be art-vampire. It seems that this initial impression turns out to be false. Oh, Troma, the sign of a lack of quality: sometimes they will offer something that is garbage but funny and with at least a little skill for junk-food craft (or sometimes not). This is a case in which there is not even a lot of fun to look at since his humorous attempts (that is, the father of the protagonist is an old eagle that makes the impressions of Jimmy Durante?) Are at least the weakest and any unintentional laughter are highlighted by Sergio Lapel <br /> <br /> And it is not without him his attempt, oh Mister no. He is trying very hard, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, of course, but the way they are used in the movie I made, a former director and aspiring director, I got upset in my chair: if I saw this in a theater , eyes in many cases, and wonder if the DP does not really understand the basic lighting set in 3 points. While this, along with a very sound-free sound design (or just a lot of random songs such as in the art gallery scene), should not be something that comes to attention during a Troma launch , it should be something * can be approached even if the script is not very funny or frightening (and is not) or if Lapel makes a strange mix of songs placed in bizarre moments. It's not a good film of any stretch, and maybe if you're a dead vampire (or just a vampire period), you might have an appeal as an alternative to the underground of Near Close merchants or as a slight improvement over, for example, Blood Freak in 1972. You have better ways to waste your time in general.
