Quirky, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - all these are teasers that make me look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a gem of a movie. Well, I was disappointed. Julian Po never crosses himself. The film is unexpectedly self-conscious. I found myself unable to put an end to unbelief for a moment. Overburdening, obvious theater sets, overstretching, obvious act of theater, overuse, the obvious direction of the theater - well, you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to deliver the hammer style. And it's hard to feel anything about Julian Po, because we never know too much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townspeople, the idiocy cleric, the old children - why would anyone decide, especially whoever has a long-standing ambition to reach the seaside (Slater's character), to remain in such a glorious place?
