You have to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, enthusiasm and enthusiasm for filming: between 1985 and 2000 he made 34 great movies. Unfortunately, if the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is something to go through, it's probably all the shit (and a brief look at their IMDb ratings seems to check my beating). Part 3 sees a group of inconvenience by finding students more detentions than usual after being attacked by hordes of living dead who escaped from an extremely secret army base directly under their school. Working from a terrible scenario by director Brian Eklund (who relies heavily on free use of the bomb), director Sheets still offers an amateur amateur effort, featuring awful performances from his talent, horrifying visual effects, and what seems to be the front of a giant cardboard space) and its small mark (the organ holes drawn under the clothing of its victims). Eventually, after what seems to be an eternity that followed the irritating characters running for their lives and the unruly people of the unenviable people who feed on animal witchcraft, Zombie Armageddon ends with an end of time traveling / paradox forcing spectators to watch a few tortuous minutes from the beginning of the movie. Frankly ... once it was enough, Mr. Sheets? What did we do to deserve to look again?
