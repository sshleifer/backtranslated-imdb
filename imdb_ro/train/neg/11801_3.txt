As a great fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The set of garlands and sharpened sets illuminate any style in this remake. Mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies in the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his stylish wardrobe and "Swank" apartment do not match the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character.He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a real choice. The English accent and California show that she can not hold a candle to the voice of velvet and sex Barbara Stanwick. Lee J.Cobb is fashion-minded Barton Keyes, but even his performance is morose, without style. <br /> <br /> It feels like the television movie was back and reminds me of what a remarkably original movie is still.
