In 5 minutes in this movie, I was hyperventilated, shaking and comforting in pain. And not in a good way. The story is about a band of idiot kids who make phone calls to a psychopath who is always a good idea. It seems that psychoshocks do not like phone calls, because in 2 minutes he is killing their mother and poor Williams at their door. Well, skip 15 years and guess what? He still kissed the phone calling people. Yeah, you'd think a horrible crime would have prevented them from doing this again, but not. So, about two hours later and too many cries of shouting, I realized that this film gave me only a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe desire to take my own life. This piece of nonsense does not even deserve to laugh at unconditional production, "acting" or Rutger's shrinking haul. I like horrible movies, but this is the most unsatisfying song I've ever seen. Just not.
