I'm not spies in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, though. As an executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the many absurdities of his character in 10 elements or less, an indie-sensible film and just be absorbed in mentor / be-all-that-you-can - is a theme. He plays an alternate universe, a semi-washed version of true Morgan Freeman, who is accompanied in an old Econovan by a child to Carson, CA from Brentwood to investigate his next film role. Why Carson is a mystery to So. Horse residents. He could have saved the trip and would have gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same items. Paz Vega is quite seen, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a boring dissatisfied on a large but slow local market, which apparently is the final source of Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known only as "He", to allude to the way actors are seen when they meet in real life by ordinary people ... "Psst, this is" him ", etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted by the fact that He had all sorts of worldly wisdom and had no return to his Brentwood home, had no cash or debit cards, or had the wisdom of keeping a cell phone with him. so high that they think they have an answer to everything that is doing it, then I have to see money and a BlackBerry that displays smart intelligence and good survival instincts to keep that great ego that it surely has true. Nothing really happens in this movie. I do not think that any of the main characters has been substantially altered by their encounter with others, flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then ndeşte that thought was like Steve Martin's Shopgirl site without sexual business was indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing to the public.
