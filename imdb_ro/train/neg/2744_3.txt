I was bored around 22:00 so I watched this movie. And I could not help laughing anymore. Everything was so ridiculous. The way children behaved as if they were older than 11 years broke me. One of the children had a ring that supposedly killed people after 3 years. He gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. It's pretty hard to take the kids seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They behave like everything is such a big deal, as when Billy (the main character) does not eat worms, then the world is over. This is a good movie for young children (except that a 5-year-old says "penis"), but not for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste their time.
