He has his merit; Morvern Callar is both merits and disappointments. It's so enigmatic, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of the lost one, which makes it so remote and non-relative? Or is she like a revolutionary reviewer? I personally would have called her a dysfunctional one. Morvern is completely detached. Leaving her boyfriend without thinking about informing her family or using the money she gave her for an appropriate burial, she selfishly splashes on a trip to Spain. It seems to be so lacking in relative human greed bar. The only element that allows the audience to see her human side is her close friend is taking a vacation with her. Although, her boyfriend is thrown into the air, and Morvern has nothing to connect his humanity. Despite the fact that Spain made it look so bleak and unshakable as the UK, the director's photos were gorgeous, the light and the color made the film amazingly visual. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the movie has nothing to keep it interested. It's just over 90 minutes, but it feels a lot more. They manage to make Morvern look interesting to attract attention, but only to alienate it from you to the point where you do not care about characters or film.
