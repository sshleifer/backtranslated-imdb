Indeed, indeed, absurd, terrible, terrible. But actor Clayton Moore (Lone Ranger) is acting as an actor. He is the only one. A rare treat for five minutes, if you want to find the depths of transparent grotesque special effects, Southern California as the "moon" (again and again and again) and acting so hard in wood that it could be a doll . . . except that it is clear that it is not - no humor here except unintentional. Dialogue can be worse than any of these aspects and costumes. . . well, he said enough. Plot? What plot? The bad guy and his agents, including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or you'll think he's a doll in the name of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc) and his incredibly ineffective guns (who still have guns that do not have never need recharging, as is Commando Cody, so there are many challenges to fire). Enjoy.
