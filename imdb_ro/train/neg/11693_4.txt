A fun concept, but badly executed. Except for the pretty good effects of makeup, there's not much to go with. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what appears to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to thin Deathly in days ... and once it's Deathly slim he it remains pretty much as thin for Deathly what seems to be a long time <br /> <br /> However, the film has much worse than the fact that. cinema is unquestionably low-budget TV-show-quality and most of all acting is pretty awful around. Robert John Burke seems to be always trying for some kind of freaky personification Charlton Heston and it is literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I give this movie as big as me is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the film develops a fun, "abator cheesefest" campy feel, and the crazy gangsters to torment the completely useless gypsies are somewhat amusing to look at. The end, if predictable, is also wonderful. Avoid if you are not a king-o-Phile or I'm very psychic at the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice in the Simpsons terrorizing a Gypsy camp.
