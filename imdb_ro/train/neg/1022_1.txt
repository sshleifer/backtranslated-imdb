Starting with the poster (which includes only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another, this movie was nothing - or nothing new at least. After 10-15 minutes, you realize you just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another bite. In principle, the story is about the corrupt system in some city, all secretly backbone businesses and the city, under the eyes of a giant politician. The almighty organization above is called FRAT and guess what? they have a cop kick and a beating fight - suspects, buddy, you call it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they make mistakes discovered by a young and talented journalist (!!!). An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad scenes with several stereotypical lines, it all ends happily and serves the final line: you can not beat the system. Bah! You do not see this movie loss. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes!
