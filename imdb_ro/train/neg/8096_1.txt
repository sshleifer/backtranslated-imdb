Most book adaptations are bad, but this film left key parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They resumed the story and the scenes combined and changed the order. They added ridiculous things that have never happened in this book and would never happen. If I had not read the book before, it would have been an incredibly dull movie, you did not care about the characters, they did not like it. It turns the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The two-hour waste of my life.
