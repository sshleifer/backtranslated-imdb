Do you know when you are on the bus and someone decides to tell you their story of life and sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you want to do is put the madman and go? I had a similar feeling while watching this movie. Okay, I choose to go see Aprile and know about Nanni Moretti's taste of becoming the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last tranche of my memories I wanted to give Moretti madre all the palms. Caro Diario was funny, unusual and at least a few other characters managed to get a word on the edge. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue, so that what you hear for an hour and a half is a tangle about the way his politics is the best or what part of the folk culture he feels fantasy for now. He also finds time to scratch movies that he does not like, which I thought was reserved for losers like me. Of course, being in a position like his, you would have thought he would try to do something about cinema a little smarter than that. Probably making an appropriate film, one with some decent ideas and structure, or perhaps one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started drinking the newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of a normal person, preferably not a self-obsessed film director, with a strange queer for sticky music. The next time someone you do not know is trying to tell you their life story, give it a hand from me. Each blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettists.
