I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but she was disappointed by many levels. First of all, the story is so badly recycled that it almost makes it impossible. Second, the setting, act and story are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many more good black actors out of which you can choose than these standard tips. How about the originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs played entirely - if any. Nobody seemed really central. Overall, the movie was a great disappointment, but the style of editing was very exciting and almost made the film useful.
