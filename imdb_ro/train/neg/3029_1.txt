From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible succession of extremely short cuts of blurred work with the camera. While the whole intrigue has all the potential for a thriller, the story is so badly said I can not buy it. In the middle of the movie, the actions of the characters do not make sense. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILS. For example, Edna's idea of ​​making Edna coffee after she shot his son's arm is far below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino, who does not question the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams, about a broken telephone connection, has eluded me; Should not there be much suspicion that Williams makes them? Those FBI agents seem not to be present with a single helicopter on something that has every reason to consider a capital mafia coup. In addition, what they do by keeping and leaking information to Cigliutti is an incitement to murder; I'm good at justice, if that's what the FBI is investigating. In fact, he would have had a puzzling case if he would act like that. We will see a car accident that would normally be at least seriously injured if it does not kill most of the passengers, but miraculously leaves them with just a few bruises. On the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love with Choco, which is from the point of view of Domino, in no way founded on the previous events, but just by being drugged to the eyeball. The whole sequence of scenes from Claremont Williams' phone call seems to me as interesting as it should be dramatic. This, combined with the terrible and uncomfortable work of the room, makes only a piece that I hesitate to make a movie. I'm sorry for the lost effort of the main actors, whose talents are not in question.
