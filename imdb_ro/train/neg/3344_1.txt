I should pretend to say that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. Man discovers some of the funniest imaginable cliches of action and Detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler * even if there is no such Dolph spoiler because the scriptures are so absurd to get started: a chase scene with a handicapped child wearing a pistol vs. a guy on a Harley with a submuller gun, school school and the child wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for laughing, old friend. In summary: Wonderful movie, which is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend that you invite some friends for this and force them to stay with it. Hilarious.
