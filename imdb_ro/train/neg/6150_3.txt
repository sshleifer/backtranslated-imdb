I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. Certainly not. It is one of those films that seem to have been made exclusively for the Oscar: music throughout the film in almost every frame, almost no profanity, established in a long time, pictures of sepia toned, pretentious title, NU SEX and the genius explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi, so that we (the stupid audience) can understand it. One thing that amuses me is the fact that they have written NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (named after a current person named Alfred Nobel) "the noble price." Jesus! How can such a mistake be made in such a large production is supposed to be based on a true story. What a false! What are you and the others who think RON?
