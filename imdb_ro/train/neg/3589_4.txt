I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the distribution list, but after I looked at it, I must admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this film is that actors are not able to keep this film on their backs. Why? Because of the bad scenario. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are trying very hard to make this film on a different level, there are no innovative stories and the direction is too common. So for fans of Matt Dillon, this is a movie that can be watched, just like the admirers of beautiful Diane Lane. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a movie for him; far below its level. So, if you're connected to this big cast, look at it, but do not expect anything great or extraordinary. The only thing you'll remember about this movie is Diane Lane's scenes; the rest is very forgetful.
