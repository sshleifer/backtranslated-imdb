I have seen a lot of bad plots in my time, but this is one of the worst. Once he has touched a certain disease in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he goes on a ramp, killing people (as it is beyond me, I just follow them, I can not explain them.) This is the kind of film that should not have been done first.
