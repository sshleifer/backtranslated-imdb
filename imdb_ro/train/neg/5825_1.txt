This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people who left the theater, others fell asleep (well, it was a late night show) ... This is a meaningless movie, one of those who can make you stop seeing the picture again . I would love to watch this movie, because I am deeply interested in what is happening in the minds of the authors of this garbage. Do they laugh when they make all these ridiculous things or even think they do something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is terrifying, apart from a few instrumental things that remind you of an earlier Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. Small, small pieces of beautiful music are no reason for you to come out and be subjected to this torture. God!...
