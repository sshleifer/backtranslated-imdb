Unlike most commentators, I deeply hate this series. It starts to look interesting, with mysterious strangers and giant robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. At the end, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And I realized I was in 26 episodes consisting mainly of the character's character, selfishness and self-pity. In fact, he revolves between alien / robot battles and those dark, depressing scenes that blink and stop where one or more characters can say or scream "I hate you" ten times in a row. /> <br /> I do not really see either Shinji, or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing an increase or change. (I can not see any of the other characters who learn or grow, either for that). I wanted to kick them and tell them to have a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling did not change over the last few episodes. Shinji really possesses the kind of helpless hope that makes people rather angry than charity, and Asuka is such an infuriating thing that knows how to destroy him every time he comes. Oh, and more than anybody else, these two hate everything and say very often. Actually, I'm a big fan of anim√© and manga and I never liked it so much. I read that the writer / writer of the series wrote this while suffering from a depression and I can believe it; made me depressed to look at her. Is this the purpose of this series? Ask frankly. Is it designed to make the spectator confused and disturbed? And if you suffer from a depression, why do not you write any books or biographies about it, instead of mixing it with aliens and mecha? This plot of foreign war, as far as I can say, goes absolutely nowhere. Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this mosaic of dead plots, I can not help you, but no wonder how many of them actually consider it good and how many say they do because they were told that it is.
