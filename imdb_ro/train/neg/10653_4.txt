One two two three four five six six eight and back, haha. This must be seen, first of all, to see the work. There are a lot of things displayed, you see those close ones, the man you will enjoy. A few years ago, a video was based on this movie. It's a slash, but without suspense. The end is also funny, and the clothes he wears in wood that copper is facing, Jesus, looks like a clown. Killing is mostly on the screen, blood is flowing, but never too bad. There is a lot of battle scene and, hey, no one has been hurt. And the gun you kill, you have never seen such a big one, you will not hurt it, you have to see it. And being a slasher, there's a lot of T & A. To guess who's the killer, you'll be caught a few times, and that's the best part, but what about the copper's story in the woods, huh! But yet, thanks to its cheese, this is still something many would like to have. I'm glad I have my copy, one of the failures of glory. But the man, the clothes, not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in the 1940s then this is one behind the memory strip.
