Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg," will take the heat, along with Wes Craven, for another "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, who praised an incredible story and a dog that has a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (just in name). A bunch of border guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area, surrounded by hills full of mutants. One by one, end-of-week soldiers are kidnapped. That's it. There are strong violence and a reasonable scene in the case of brutal rape, but it is nothing else precious to be delighted. The film's "heroes" are a bunch of clich√©s and mutants, far from Craven's original family, much like Brian Thompson of "Cobra," coupled with some creatures that Stan Winston left behind the " ". Much of the action takes place in caves, "The Descent," and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A funny look is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven of a sympathetic mutant who sinks into the cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original "Chainsaw". Weisz will be accused of this boring disaster, but he is not really guilty because he does his best to keep his suspense and squeeze some freshness out of controversial situations. He's not a fan, unfortunately.
