I could not think of the back of the mask: the rise of Leslie Vernon (a more amazing massive film) when we look at it from realistic sense and innovative idea. this could have been a GREAT movie. acting is ... from some actors alright. from others ... it's really horrible. Beyond that idea is great and the format is great. the story is pretty good, though it often suffers from big blows for the logical mind. this is a horror film, after all. I really want to see this remake ... I really want to be the fantastic movie she wants to be. (and you can not really blame the mind behind the movie for that), this is obviously built on a shoe budget line. and fx really hurt the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Great movie. ... if you change for better action and a slightly better fx. anyone who wrote it should continue, however, a great idea here.
