There was something here, with the feminine leadership having this perfect life she always wanted after the worst possible life, starting with a childish prostitute and ending with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain, and this completely destroys him in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position that Dean Cain has entered and the choice she made. She can not hurt her because she loves her, and she is the mother of her child (I think time indicates that he is his child and not his brother) but at the same time he can not forgive her for everything he did while sleeping with his brother his (showing the love and duty he felt was somehow) and then part of his death. In better hands it would have been a better movie, but for something caught on cable late, it's not bad.
