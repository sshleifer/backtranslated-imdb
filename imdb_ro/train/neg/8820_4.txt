In a movie like me, we're expecting nothing but fun, except for a wave of killing ..... what I received was even less. Christmas dinner 1947 a child confesses that his parents do it while Dad is in a Santa costume. Fearful, he climbs the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later, and Harry Stalling is your regular everyday joe ... because he's obsessed with Santa. After his boss has fun with him, he goes mad, dresses like a Santa, and starts killing the faithful patrons and his boss. An unwavering neighborhood catches him and, as he strikes, drives his van from a rock ... ... per month. It's not the best end I've ever seen, but it was original. It was a slow, boring film that really had no quality of redemption, unless Harry went apeshyt to the churches. It was not hard no gore and even "sex" scenes were toned down. Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
