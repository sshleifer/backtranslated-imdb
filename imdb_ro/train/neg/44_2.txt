I'm not sure if I mean those who tagged an ugly video or a director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a bizarre "horror" movie. The land is a goosey loosey combo of superior films such as "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". Chick is kidnapped in a "jungle" by a "tribe" of "savages." The Jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk in Halloween costumes, Party Hall style, in the style of tribal clothing. And the savages are in the race, from white to asian, black, to Hispanic. I suppose Franco just picked up someone who seemed even a little ethnic for this. To make things worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real spells and no useless penis. That's not funny. I can find something to like almost any Italian film or Euro-garbage; it fell very short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
