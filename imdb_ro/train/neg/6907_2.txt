No amazing writing here because it does not deserve one. It's not an art movie. Not even one of these "hidden" stones. You know, like those movies you hear through a friend who saw this amazing movie in the city center where they show all the independent goodies and art movies. Soak it in the Christmas boxes and get rid of it quickly.
