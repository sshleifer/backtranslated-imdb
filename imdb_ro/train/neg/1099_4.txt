I was shocked by the incredible incredible plot of Tigerland. It was a fantasy of the liberal about how the army must be. Dialogue was difficult to swallow, along with the silly things of Colin Farrell's character, was allowed to escape his superior officers. I always thought, "Hey, there is a reason for the boot camp it's hard. They had to subdue the soldiers for battle and turn them into a cohesive unit." There is no room for deceptive attitudes and for men who will not follow orders ". I was rooted for Bozz to hit his ass because there was such a danger to his soldiers. I would not want to fight with someone like him in the war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than doing what was necessary to protect his unity. <br /> <br />
