I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I like almost any British sitcom (well ... maybe not lunar Python, some jokes were wonderful, but some of them did not understand.) But this League of Gentlemen is just a good thing to make you sick. This performance was good in a way; helped me lose weight, because I look at this trash makes me feel like I do not need hunger anymore. This is really just a disgusting, sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at these things. I saw it for about 10 minutes and I stopped it. It was so disgusting, looking at men dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... that's ... what's so funny? It makes me want to eat. No humor, just the disorder of the pictures and cheap laughter, the toilet ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go on ... look at it ... but to be honest, the people who look and feel enjoy this must have some emotional problems. Trash.
