I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. I felt like I was watching this movie for 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they thought when they did that. It's barely enough to get Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and end. It felt almost like leaving this movie open for a sequel. It was like watching a Soprano television episode. It ends suddenly and you know there will be another episode next week. I also felt that I was just looking at the first part of a two-part film. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they became lazy, they were out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a Dahmer 2. After seeing this movie, they all sounded very accurate. I was following Jeffrey Dahmer to go through the woods. Suddenly I heard that this music is playing, then writing on the screen and saying how Dahmer served two years of conviction and was attacked by a detainee and killed at the age of 34. Wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. But how does it look like he got there? How about showing Dahmer's trial? How about showing more details. I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped everywhere. In fact, I woke up saying with mistrust, "Is that the end?" I want to finish this review by saying that there is still a good Dahmer film to be done. For the directors, I would like to say, if you do, do well.
