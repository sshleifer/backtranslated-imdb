There has been no characterization in this movie and it really shows how much the craft has to learn this talented hack who has directed this. All his characters in this movie were so impossible to accomplish and I could care less. The best point of this movie was the end-of-the-hour and the one-hour showdown after I was so dirty that I lost money on this full load. Hey genius .... triads and yakuza are from two different places learn about Asian culture. Dog scene in this sense has been hung up and useless. This DVD is useful. I like my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So children do not lose your money in the house.
