Brief Summary: This film deforms everyone he touches. That means you. First, let me say that I am not a purist, and this would have been fun for a few minutes. Impersonations are not bad. But overall, it's just boring and amazingly funny. Some simple jokes are repeated again and again. It is clear that these films exist just to squeeze out the last few dollars of those now labeled, Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not have any real attention to their place in film history or their talents. That's what made me the most offended. Of course, my daughter liked, so I'm a failure as a parent;)
