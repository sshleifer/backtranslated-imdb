Just by emailing a friend who is in the movie school about this movie. Something to avoid when we make a movie - characters that stutter scary, overloaded, tilted and unconvincing monologues on screen. If the film is an attempt of social realism, these verbal barrages are so great that they draw attention to film-based film and effectively neutralize this intention. Is the protagonist also incredibly incredible for social realism - consumption of literary octopus and canonical literary octopus while he is tall or hungry and capable of so profoundly producing sophomoric soloquoic while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, sleepless and verbal powerless man capable of sleeping the majority of women he meets in minutes of meeting with them? (I had to applaud when a guy eventually hit the street despite her crying and the boring self). The visitor encounters pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. Imminent killing of mankind, in the form of barcodes printed on the forehead or on the right hands in frightening biblical modes, is presented to a character who is so cleverly exposed in his role as blank space guard. <br /> <br /> This movie is scripted and over the top - a melodrama filled with pedestrian philosophy about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. It is ludicrous, overwhelmed and exhausting. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent trip, much more interesting in people's lives in a similar social environment. That's for "In the War Zone". And although the comparison is not even justified, check out something from Peter Greenaway, who is much more capable of dialogue, characters and absurd situations.
