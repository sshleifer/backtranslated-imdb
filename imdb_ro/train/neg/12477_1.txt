This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends hang around with beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me I found myself looking at myself. My friends and I hired a big block of movies and never came to see that. It was behind me and I thought it was a waste not to follow him. So I did it and I was impressed by how terrible this movie is. Now, I really like bad movies and probably would have liked this movie if the "hero" was not that bad. The entire movie was hoping he'd put down that stupid sword and let someone kill him! He has very few heroic things in the movie. It's stupid, disgusting and stupid. He has less redemptive qualities than the bad ones. And what about all the naked kids? I mean, I like naked puppies as much as the next guy, but this movie went on board in that department. Okay, anyway, if you like bad movies and you're a disgusting hero, "then I'm sure you'll love this shot of a movie.
