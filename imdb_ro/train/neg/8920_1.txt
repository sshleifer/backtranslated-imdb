... but this must be the worst adaptation of Christmas Carol of all time. And that needs something, of what enjoys different efforts in life. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I enjoyed it extraordinary in other roles (look at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes, for example). But the script offers no choice but to chew the landscape. And eat it, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim tying up on a Christmas run. Give me the classics anytime: Alastair Sim, 1951. Except for Scrooged, all the rest are just over time, the efforts to understand the past, present or future Christmas Spirit.
