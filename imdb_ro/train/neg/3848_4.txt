The film is almost ridiculous, and Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters join as mothers of convicted criminals. With horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women join the NY team and leave California to open and sing and dance for Shirley Temple-like girls. From the beginning, it becomes obvious that Reynolds made a mistake in taking Winters with her in California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who seems to be making more and more of the rocker. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, women living together get intimidating phone calls. Reynolds, who puts on a blonde wig, is soon trained by the rich father of his students, played beautifully by Dennis Weaver. Agnes Moorehead, in one of her latest films, is seen briefly to Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener. The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. It's hard here and weight seems to make it even better. Winters has always done a good role in testing her nerves. The end is macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano batting with that completely crazy look?
