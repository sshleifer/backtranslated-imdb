I was expecting this to be much better. I like Tim Burton's work, so I was very excited to see these short films online. Well, they were not what I expected. I do not know exactly what I do not like. I think they're just boring. The sound disturbs me most of the characters, though I liked Roy Boy Toxic and Stainboy. The Match Girl episode probably bothered me most, though it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I also do not like the way some characters die. Such as the way Match Girl set fire in the gas station or how Girl Who Stares died in general. Roy's death was funny, surprising. Death by a car smell. Very original ;-) That made me laugh so much ... There are a few things that are not right for kids. Just a tongue and a gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
