I took this movie for $ 5 at a discount discount store, Adam Sandler is a wonderful actor and I thought it would be a good movie, okay, it was not. It was not a story at all, the bad jokes, and the other comedian said "F-Word" in any other word he said, the curse usually does not bother me, but that was over the top. And even worse than the lack of story line were the parts when Sandler just started talking in the room at the film's happenings, reminded me of Dora Explorer when they come back and look at the screen and ask you questions. And the last is when they would randomly put Bikini photos of girls in random moments in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
