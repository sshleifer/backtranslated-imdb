Yeah, I saw the rough cuts. Needless sexual scenes. Stages cut. Almost tiered with the film "Need" for horrible action. This movie is as bad as bad movies get.the evil scenario, evil acting, bad effects, bad locations, evil stunts all bad. The best "actors" in the movie were the waist dancers they hired for vampire extravaganza! Sean Harry, the "foppish actor," as someone else puts it, makes a right fit with the talent here. His stunning ability to drive an evil car when he is obviously shaken by people on the hood (see reflexion in the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is the class. Oh and do not forget the sex scene. plus the remarkable use of a toy weapon that props could not even be bothered to hide as a real gun. The other actors on the screen could bring their lines. It was like half the time they were waiting for a line that was not there! The "Special Effects" were so good that so far the boys who did it took their real credits name! If you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are a lot of good comedies that are just as funny and do not give money to people who do not deserve it.
