Okay: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen for a long time, which really scared me. The actor was not too bad, and the killer "Cupid" was credible and disturbing. Bad: The story line and script of this movie are incredibly weak. It was not too much for that. The ways the killer killed his victims was very scary and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle the gore. Overall: a good scarecrow, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
