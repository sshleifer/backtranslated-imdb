this movie was so gay as a mother and a cat cat having sex, they also scared of the little kitty cats. they light up on them. mother extraterrestrial cat kills a guy by chasing him back with a corn ear? they are proof bullet. invisible. and what not. the star of the movie, Clovis, is the policeman's cat, Clovis leads the cops to find his mother's stranger, and after the mother kills the cops, Clovis kills his mother by eating his head, then catches the fire. this movie sucks. it was much more fun than it was scary, it was not even scary at all. the girl hits the stranger on his head with a camera, pulls it off. she then goes and hugs her. then grabs her and starts raping her. Once again, Clovis comes to rescue
