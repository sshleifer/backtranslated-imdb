I have always admired Susan Sarandon for integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talent as an actor. So it seemed strange to me that she would appear in a movie that distorted these facts. The rejection of her South Pole character was made by a Canadian charter company in Edmonton, Alberta, flying on a Canadian plane designed and built Twin Otter. The trip had been denied by the US Air Force, the Navy and the Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. The same company organized a similar rescue a few years later to remove a man from the base of the South Pole. I think the film was pretty good a very important topic and documented a very courageous woman who is facing a terrible task. I do not understand why manufacturers would consider it necessary to ignore the courage of rescue pilots and show the rescue plan as a Hercules USAF.
