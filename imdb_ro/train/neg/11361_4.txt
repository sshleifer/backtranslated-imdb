It's quite surreal to make these flying ... well ... that's a cartoon, so anything can happen in it. At first I have to tell you that I like animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very poor. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws: 1) I quote the line of the tag. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I have not seen one, at least not something special that I have not seen before. 2) "Flies" in this movie does not show anything like real flies. At least it could have made them black. But cyan flies seriously? With giant head and thin twist? 3) Story. I think it's been written for 6-year-olds. I could say in two sentences that it is so much simplified. 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "In the end are American files!" Give me a break.
