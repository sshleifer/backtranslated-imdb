This movie made me feel like I missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as suddenly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover, in addition to whom they always trusted and respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, "Grand Canyon", for example. I could not finish this movie after it seemed an eternity, but it was probably a little more than an hour; we had to stop it. There was no comedy, there was nothing about characters that would make you feel or sympathize with them, there was no evocation of emotion about this movie, and the clips of their past were badly edited, confusing and useless. What could have been a wonderful idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (though I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I like to watch the white people get scared and get act like idiots completely make me laugh) has become a loss of my $ 1 credit to the video store.
