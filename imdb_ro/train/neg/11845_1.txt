... is the only way to describe this movie about topics that should be safe: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst strives to worry about Marion Davies as a movie star, as she thinks she is in "Legal Blonde." The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst overlaps to the point where you want to get on the screen and snap it. Eddie Izzard is pretty good except that he plays Charlie Chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 pounds too hard for the side? It is hard to believe that this unfortunate wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich but, again, he did not make a movie that could be tracked, what? 30 years? Sometimes he does not come back.
