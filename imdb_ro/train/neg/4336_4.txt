I watched this film and the original Carlitos road back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know people will say that the prequel has been done on a small budget, but that has never been related to a bad scenario. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought it was a prequel to start preparing the other movie with key characters, and maybe just a little bit about a life I did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has the name of Carlito. There should have been at least some characters in the original movie, the end does not make sense with the original. At the end of this movie he retires with a sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of prison in the next movie? And his wife is not even the same woman he speaks as his only love in the original. I would say that the movie is easy to entertain itself with a few decent bits, but it stops when it's held up to the big brother. Do not stay awake at night waiting for you to see this, watch the original once again if you need a shot.
