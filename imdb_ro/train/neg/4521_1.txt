The whole genre of Biker Movie has to be made up of the worst movies ever made. It offers a lot of battles, generous bloodsheds, bikers fighting against the Indians, and a wild city that is thrown into the air and thrown into a boat at some point. The acting is beyond terrible. What has happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point, he was in some major studio productions and then disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it's good to look. At the end of the movie, you should feel a little careless because you saw it!
