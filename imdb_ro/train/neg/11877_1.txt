I think that's almost all I have to say. But I feel compelled to explain my actions. In principle, I have never seen such a production of reinforcements and I want to say this in every sense of the word. Although physical camera work, MIC exploitation and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately they are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent movies that have been saved by their great characterization scripts and plotting, this unfortunately has a terrible scenario, terrible action and the worst of all, annoying awesome characters . <br /> <br /> It is a crime that, for every independent film that becomes, distribution like the Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films that died in silent deaths. I do not know who Kornbluth brothers know to Sony, but that may be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production has ever been distributed. I'm pretty confused why they chose that. The only part of this film underlying any intrigue is its title. However, the reason why he is even disappointed. I hope this review will save some people who might be intrigued by this movie title to watch. I have seen a lot of movies in my time, and I'm very forgiving when I was in the cinema, but that was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel", because it has marked an important point in my cinema life. Shame is such a low point.
