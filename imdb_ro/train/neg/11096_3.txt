I had great hopes for this film because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely terrible, the safest, low-budget cinematography I've ever seen. But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is absolutely useless and flat. The scene after the scene seems to be accidentally thrown into the mix without thinking too much of narrative or character. Claire tries to get rid of prostitution or not? Hard to say. Why does he take the trick at the airport if he wants to get rid of that life? Why do not he then pick up tricks when he needs money in Seattle? Why do we need to see how her hair dries in exactly the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The director does not seem to know. It feels like everything is improvised (though I understand it was not the case), and the directors kept a room they were doing as if they had done a documentary verisimilitude. After the view we saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices, condemning cinematic narrative as politically conservative. It seemed the learned rhetoric. I think it was a tree. I'm sorry that the maker of a film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would continue to make a movie so painful as this and then defend him with tired old "political".
