If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's good. NOT. The movie itself made me sleep. It was slow, had minimal violence and poor use of the suspension. The actress was the stuff of the bottom feeder and intrigue, while it would have been cool for a different movie, was badly presented here. They even kill the only good character in the whole movie! I give it 2 out of 10, because the only thing that was good was the twist of the plot at the end. Besides, you may want to save yourself from this trash.
