Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Wrong error. I've seen 950 movies and is really one of the worst of them - it's terrible in almost any way: editing, pacing, story, "action", soundtrack (the only song of a movie - less than four times). The film looks cheap and ugly and is boring in the extreme. I have rarely been so happy to see the final credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving her a score of 1 is Harvey Keitel - while it is far from his best performance, at least he seems to do a bit of effort. One for Keitel only obsessive.
