This movie is S-L-O-W. He spent most of the movie waiting to start. The setting was bleak, the scenario was bleak, the cinema was bleak, the plot was grim, the budget was low, low-budget films were bad, but this does not have redemption features). Plot was consumed with a revenge hunter, slightly disturbed than Wendigo, who made a short appearance at the end of the movie. This in itself was disappointing because this "Wendigo" was just a bizarre mixture of tree and deer. Everything about the movie was insipid. The boy's parents seemed rather distant, and sometimes they seemed completely detached from their son. Whether it was a bad scenario or an evil scenario, I'm not sure, but it has increased my level of disappointment and boredom. There was no food for thought, nothing to attract interest. Without any real intrigues or a cool factor, this movie spit so painful, you just can not care less about what happened to the end. Ambience Wendigo reminds me of the boring film presented at the award ceremony towards the end of "Mr Bean's Feast": a film that is artistic and meaningless, trying too hard to be profound and meaningful, but that comes as pretentious and boring. again. I looked in the hope, in vain hope, that something interesting might happen ... but not.
