I like MBNA munna bhai, but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring film in my life. And these great ratings really amazed me that Wat happened to the taste of the viewers in India? <br /> <br /> ** CAN BE SPOILER ** A educated girl needs advice from a Bhai, the people who discuss their personal problems. on the phones come the man from which part of the world u r ??? I agree that films should be fictional, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars are good for 15 minutes)
