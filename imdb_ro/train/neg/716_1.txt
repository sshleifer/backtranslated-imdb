This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story, gags are just for the retard and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie Fredi (oh, God, what a funny name ha ha) does not always wonder how it came from one plane to another. There are a lot of stupid and completely dysfunctional characters whose name should sound funny. e.g. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile during the whole movie. Gags appear to be made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is caught in the door (this happens 5 times), then this movie is probably for you. Another funny scene: They try to guess the code word for a closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the word code is (ha ha): dung. So if you laughed at these examples, you might want this movie. For all the others: Go to Youtube and watch "Lord of the Weed": it's more fun.
