This movie is not funny. It's not fun. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor will it cause you to show the least interest in characters or situations. Added to the fact that it's a minor movie like anything else in recent memory. It's like a group of 14 or 15-year-old high-school children who never met or had a relationship with a real girl sat down and wrote a film based on their incorrect fantasies about being an adult man. This movie is boring, unusually mindful and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. It also appears to be twice as long as the 85-minute operating time.
