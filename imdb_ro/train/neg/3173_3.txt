This film is similar to the song "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The plan of a ghost wife and environment is closely related to Coward's writing. I am surprised that such films do not recognize the original concept of the writer. I realize that the audience may not know that this is a knockoff, but it is. These movies are so expensive to produce. I can do it when a scenario is original. I can do it even when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously launched. Several samples have been mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively accessible form of entertainment. However, do not ask, when the taste of the public is taken into account. In this situation, the taste of the public is overlooked. I look forward to having more fun in the movie. In this case. Rather I see the play.
