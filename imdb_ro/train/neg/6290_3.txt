Review: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deep and loved, and they are sure they are perfect for each other, even if they met only a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother who must be, is not so happy. He is afraid that marriage is a threat to his cushy job in his family business and he decides to organize Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, to get evidence and break Ron and Mel up. Comments: It's supposed to be a sequel to a classic comedy, but it's not funny at all. It is mostly a pubertal show and an excuse for minors to show women dressed up quickly. In fact, in a way, it's almost impressive that you have a lot to put in there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, it is also one of the signs of a movie that can not be sustained. It just is not good enough. But he has three redemption points, or actually three actors who deserve a better scenario than that. Actor Josh Cooke is the one who leads, in fact, to give the impression of common sense. Sara Foster I know he has more talent than to make such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have far more talent than this film. What is absent in suspicion is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are quite limited. It's not really funny. 3/10
