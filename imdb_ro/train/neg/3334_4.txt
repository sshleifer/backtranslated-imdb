That scared me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than frightening, but with a few rather restless moments and a kind of poor quality that I like. And, think about it, the plot is actually quite disgusting ... but manipulated with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are huge drawbacks in which nothing interesting or exciting happens. Also, the end continues forever, making a potentially tense climax seemed sluggish after a while, with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster", after being exposed, is not very scary either unfortunately. Somewhat amazing aspect of the film also works against it, making it appear as a TV movie more than anything done for theaters. But it is an example of movies that are rarely made today, so I urge horror fans to look at him and feel a little nostalgic ...
