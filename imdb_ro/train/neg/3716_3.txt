Lance Barton, the main character, is also killed in heaven before his time. When the sky learns about this mistake, the body of rich rich old and white Wellington wealthy is given to him. A young black guy in an old body of white men who still behaves like a young black man is perhaps funny if you see him made by an old white actor. In this movie I came to remember many times: "Chris Rock should be an old white guy." The whole concept does not play as it was intended: "Illusion" is not well transported, and the love story is not credible at all. The fact that all you see is that Chris Rock, playing a young black guy, because the old people everyone should see is only presented in small scenes, it is a challenge for the unhindered suspension of viewers.
