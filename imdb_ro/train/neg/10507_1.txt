OK, me and a friend we rented this a few days ago because we like to keep a record of movies b since we do ourselves. Anyway, the cover contained blood and strange naked girls with tits and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!! Looks like it's a waste! It was not really a story, the dialogue was horrible (is there someone? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really missed any personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what's with these long artistic photographs of people scared to run around not doing anything .. with extreme eye closures and stuff? I was sitting all over the movie waiting for something ... something to happen ... but no ... "oh, here comes the nymphs Big! Oh .. kissing ... again ... and now for ... OK ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, now running ... and with your eyes closed ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini! ... well ... Okay, maybe something interesting or interesting now will happen .. no .. oh ... cool ... a distant head ... the end ... oh shit .. "And finally, since I'm both full of me ... I'm telling you this! Give me a truck, six actors, a strange house, Tom Savini, a few empty girls with talons and blood buckets, and I could do the hottest movie you've ever seen ... I made zero-budget movies two days, which has better effects, better action and a better scenario than this one ... what does this man Johannes do? Making cool movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I'm really upset!
