First, I have to say that I worked for the blockbuster and saw some movies to the point where it hurts me to find something I did not see. Taking this into account, I want everyone to know that this movie was the worst movie ever made, made me eat for Gigli, my boss's daughter, and any other piece of junk you've ever seen. BeLyt must be out of his mind, I found only one person who liked and even could not tell me what the movie was. If you are able to decipher this film and you can tell me what it was about, it has to be the writer or the fortune-teller, because there is another way in which a person might realize that stupidity. <br /> <br /> FOR LOVE FROM GD STAY!
