They are in danger! Wow, prepare to be blown away by the unusual ways of the ninjas. Watch them as they walk, crawl along the ground (back or stomach) like a caterpillar, fly through the sky, climb buildings, hide and come out of the trees, throw ninja stars, play blue mats, bring a a lot of noises bent with the blades and squeezing or falling down quickly on your toes. What a view! I may be able to handle many traditional actions, but I will be here all day. Oh, let's not forget that we get the legendary Chuck Connors to throw us again and again and watch him send the ninja with his rifle easily. What class! What fucking! Anyway, the ultra-cheap "Sakura Killers" is a stupid but frightening ninja fun that only gen fanatics could get something out of this grade b disaster. A genetic lab in America a very important movie that is stolen by a few ninjas. Two Americans are sent to Japan by Colonel (Chuck Connors) to recover him. Opening the feature does it well. Get ready for laugh! After that, they slow down, but after the two main protagonists learn about the ninja and go through the workout, they become a head of steam as they break into their suits and run off the stolen beta tape containing a very important formula. Then the rapid violent action and the aerobic martial arts really come into play. It's not too low-minded, (like the moronic screenplay and scary performances). The end of the final climate challenges is very well done. In the slowness, the two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) look at this case, sharing meaningless talks and encountering minor issues. What made me laugh was how the ninjas were hit by how courageous and clever the two were. Should they have been professional killers? Director Dusty Nelson ("Effects (1989)") does a serious job of what he has and plays for what he is. He centers on screen activities around locations in Taiwan. The score is a chintzy arrangement.
