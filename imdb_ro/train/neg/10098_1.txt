It's not worth renting video or time or occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can make. The action has been completed ... poor targeting. * Editing was very tangled ... many things did not make sense or just seemed free. * The sound was wrongly reproached. * Music was extremely inadequate. * Casting was extremely off ... it must have been on the crack. * Zombie talking about not to mention ... to drive, to dance, to work ... just annoys me. * And the bad guy ... Crap! As strange as he was ... he was the best zombie of all. Which does not say too much. Cover Art was good but very deceptive ... as was the DVD's main menu ... a great work of art and music. <br /> <br /> DONT TOT!
