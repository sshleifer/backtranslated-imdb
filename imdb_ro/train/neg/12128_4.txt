If half of the movie looks strange, it means you're looking too much at this Italian worship! Because I see, notorious demographer Lucio Fulci did not just produce this film, he took the freedom to reuse the saddest killing sequences in his own (and easier to follow) "Cat in the Brains." The already opening scene, in which a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, is shown in Fulci's film later, and another part of crazy crimes and moments. Andra Bianchi's "Masssacre" does not succeed as a giallo, as the search for a sadistic killer among a shooting crew shooting a horror movie is still convincing and suspensive, but it's also a good fun if you're in the horror trash inexpensive script introduces a bunch of repulsive characters that are all potential maniacs, but none of the Biachi red heres is likely to be plausible and you can show the killer almost immediately. true misogynish makeup, and the terrible acting performances of the ensemble. Whenever there are no bloodshots on the screen, such as between the first and the second murder, "Massacre" is slow and almost intolerable, with its incessant dialogues Extremely inexplicable photo. Fortunately, in the second half of the year, women were pushed and the men being repeatedly stabbed with rusty spirits. Music is stupid and the use of shooting locations is very unimaginable. My advice would be to jump over this puppy and go straight for "Cat in the Brain". This has all the great moments of the "massacre," and then some.
