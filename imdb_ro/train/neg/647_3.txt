The acting was terrible as well as the script. It was badly put together and made you almost laugh at countless crime scenes. The end was even worse. Everyone died, but in a way the end made everything OK. They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The film would take longer to develop a better story. The only reason I'm giving this 3/10 is that I feel sorry for the young actors. They needed a better coaching. He could even make a good movie, but the script and the acting failed.
