The premise is ridiculous, the unbelievable characters, the dialogue tribe and the ultimate absurdity. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but forgetting it makes Pepe Le Pew a focus for 2 hours as a supposed French is not as funny as it sounds. <br /> Meg Ryan is once again so perceptible and adorable as a (choose): the kewpie doll, the baby, the puppy, the kitten, whatever you think is the dearest creature on the earth. It also does not have the slightest resemblance to a real human being. This movie seems to me an opportunity for Lawrence Kasdan and Kline's friends on holiday in Paris and southern France while she was well paid. So I can not blame them.
