I just finished watching TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm ashamed to be in Melbourne where the movie was made. Diabolic action, amateur makeup effects and a very good soundtrack. As for the plot, well, that's even worse! Some of the scenes just left me amazed at how bad it was. There's a reason why they put these types of movies on night TV night - because they're garbage! Avoid at all costs.
