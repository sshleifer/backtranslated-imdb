It seems that more attention has IMDb reviewed this film than it has been in the source. Here's an unqualified review: Just when you think nothing is going to be wrong. <br /> <br /> Dress up in any way you like, this is a boring movie, full of characters that does not dress to make very little interest. <br /> <br /> If you want to convince an emo emotion that you are so deep, man. <br /> <br /> There is something to look at for your pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless you are <br /> <br /> You are. <br /> <br /> Pretentios.
