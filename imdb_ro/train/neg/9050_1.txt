I saw this film as a whole in the 1960s and 1970s, yes, it is terrible and could be the progenitor of the Popular Faces of Death series in the 1980s and 1990s. Considering the so-called "driver education" stage today, it should be necessary to see for anyone who is preparing to learn to drive. When you notice violent death in all gore and horror, surely (if you have any sensitivity) you have a more accurate perspective on the responsibilities you need to drive safely, what moment can it make a moment of lack of thought or lack of attention to steering wheel. I worked for Bell Telephone in the '70s and' 80s, and at one point I was entrusted to run a safety class. I found this movie in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people were physically ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them said later: "I never knew that a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, and another, "ROSU ASFALT", is certainly a reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I just want to find a copy when my children were present at the driver school!
