This film deals essentially with Inspector Gadget, arc-nemesis Doctor Claw, who returned after many years in the quiet city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to shoot Gadget once and for all by using a new killer to help destroy the popularity of Gadget. Unfortunately, the movie fails, the show was great, but it was revived almost 20 years later, with tragic results. Without Don Adams' voice as a Gadget Inspector, do not cut him; Dr. Claw is not just less scary visually, but more like a fighter with a cold than his original intimidating self. Granted a movie for children, but the plot is so painfully weak (the sky forbids mentioning the animation) that it fades compared to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny and bring him the speed of two decades, now has a rebellious dress style and does not play half the role he has done in the TV series. Gadgetmobile talks, as well as a plotting angle that focuses on spoken machines ON. Perhaps I'm just a kid who loved the show that grew jaded but I thought the live-action version was more pain than I could bear, but now they go and springs this full watering of the television series quality on us. It's more than I can get.
