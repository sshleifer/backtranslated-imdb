Does Shonda Rhimes's brilliant team outsource writing this somewhere offshore, perhaps to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of any of the many boring, promising beginnings but predictable during a season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they receive are so unusual, only if they evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what actually makes the well-drained medical drama - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "This could be me" sentiment. They are not funny. The actors are pretty good, but the plot lines are dead and can not be brought back to life. I'm a therapist and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical therapist. Anyone who writes her stuff waved the ethics and transfer / counter-transfer courses in Stanford. Someone has to give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with his wife bleeding the nose and therapist's involvement in him). No therapist is not that bad. Women who want to go to men - have died, I graduated all "Sex and the City". Addison in her young aggression towards the guy she likes - very inappropriate, seems so unnatural to a woman over 40, and this actress, otherwise talented, does not believe her alone and does not give her a good deal. The only good / pleasant evolutions are Addison, who is struggling with the decision to move to LA, "Voodoo Dr" and fight with the widow. This concept could work with a completely new writing team.
