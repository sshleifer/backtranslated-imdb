"Brain Machine" will put at least your brain in overdrive trying to figure out what it is. Four topics of different backgrounds and intelligence levels were selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and the environment. Because the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them does not have a familiar family should have been a tip - none of them will be missed. The whole business is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the General, but it seems to take the direction of a senator who wants to remain anonymous. Call the senator well. There is also a shady watch that the camera continues to grow, which later states that it does not take its direction from the general or the "Project". Too bad he was not more efficient, he was defeated quite easily before everything went to kablooey. If nothing else, the film is a true treasure of technology in the 1970s, offering repeat photos of mobile phones, room size computers, and a teletype car that will not give up. Perhaps this was the basis of the alternative title of the movie - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make any sense. As far as I am concerned, I would like to take into consideration a title suggested by Krisner's experiment, killed, entitled "Project of the Stress Group." It applies to both film actors and viewers. Keep an eye just above the general at the pool, when he asks an agent for his gun, a small pocket is visible above his head for a number of seconds. Maybe you want to catch this move if you're a Gerald McRaney dead fan, could he ever be so young? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a critical reverend, but you do not call him Father. For something less in his alley, try to get hands on the 1959 "The Shrews Killer". At least, at least, it is not claimed to be so serious.
