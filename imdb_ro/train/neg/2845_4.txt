This film drops from the fourth to the 1st without bothering with its third or second, sanding tools up to the sappy line, b-movie. The concept from the beginning is easily the best and most delicate part of the film. That's worth seeing. The Harlow scene in the bathtub is happening so fast, maybe you miss her. Certainly, it is not worth everything Robert Osborne has in introducing TCM to this poor-mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this alleged society prove to be holy - especially the unbelievable character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
