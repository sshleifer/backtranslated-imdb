An indication I think can be gathered by the various comments on this subject. I was quite amazed by the number of people who liked this film wanting to make it "mandatory" or "mandatory". I think this gives us a little insight into why this film and the underlying issue is so polarizing. The issue of global warming appeals to people who want to force others to "do good". She especially appeals to more "leftist" people, because it has nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, which is usually the conservatives who want to force you to be "good". the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one. He can not refrain from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they please. The political appeal is just too great. And there we remain with a scientific matter that can be of immense importance, reduced to an appealing political issue for those in the political body, with a predilection to force others to "do good". Another interesting question is how has the environmental movement been moved by such people?
