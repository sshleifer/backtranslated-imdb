Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this film is that it is against all the vampire myths respect. Like vampires walking in the sunlight. Although there are parts that make you enjoy the way that society makes movies. A scene where a vampire is slaughtered and shouting, "That's what hurts ... It's really blocked." Then it looks like there may be scenes that are missing, but you get used to after a while. And there are random sequenes of dream that really do not help with the plot. I was thinking about that, nothing made sense, but I just took a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Go to think that the battle scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to look at. Slowly while writing more of this I like this movie more. But you know, everything you do not expect at Schindlers List, but it's a fun watch.
