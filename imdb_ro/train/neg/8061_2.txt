I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I really respect his work. I wanted to be in several movies that showed her talent. With this, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. I should say that they almost put all the blame on the poor scenario. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had a remarkable performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well and Eliza Dushku is currently a Hollywood girl. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an overestimation. It had the twists and turns you'd expect, but they did not drive anywhere ... except for a bigger confusion. I just found out that it ended very anticlimatically because it did not seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions I had about the story. I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can not. With all sincerity, the only thing I think you will be afraid of is that you paid for it.
