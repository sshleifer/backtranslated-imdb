This is a complete Hoax ... The film was clearly shot in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; writing all over is Hindi - a language used in India. The route is in the typical Jaipur streets. The palace is also in Amer - about 10 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan. Movie makers in their movie (about the movie) on the Bonus DVD seem to make her sound like they risked their life shot in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene where I see a group playing around the fire is so fake that they did not even think of changing it in the popular Afghan song. They only recorded Rajasthani's popular song. How I know it because I traveled extensively in this area. They are just on the wagon band to make big on this problem. I challenge the filmmakers to deny them.
