This is one of the worst things ever to come to England, so it says very much there. The tension, when we need to find out if Lembach is staying or not, is amazing. Barely I see the beautiful secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table picnic for a while, after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This film also has many views in London, although none of them is good. There is also a point where there is almost a car crash that gets the heart rate back to a little below normal. There is also a clock that teleports, and the fear that the woman does not bring her clock back is parallel to the "Sixth Sense" horror, much more boring with the British. Add an angry fight between the British police and Dr. Rat, who has nothing, plus the electrocution of a crowd plus a cat and you ... ummm ... A British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, though it's not one of the best.
