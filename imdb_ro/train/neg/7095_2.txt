"Journal of Sex Addiction" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsion. Probably a marketing scam in the movie, this filming is a stylish shot, with a good cast and something that goes for it. The bottom line, "Journal ...", would make us believe that our sex-dependent character has the most unhappy wife in the world, an internship of boys who have nothing better to do than lose pants for him to whim; no jobs, despite being restaurateurs. At best, this movie could have been a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Journal ..." is neither now nor anywhere. That's for the deposit. (D)
