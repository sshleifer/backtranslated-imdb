I saw this movie at the London Premiere and I have to say - I did not expect too much, but I expected something that was at least a bit of fun. The "basic instinct" was not really great movie and it's still something "classic weird," but it was fun. I can recall the overturning of the channels on television on a late night, Friday or Saturday, when I came across the film and woke up to realize it. However, this blade-brain, waaay - the delayed story has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous? Well, let's just say that - for a 47-year-old man, it's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? Not. She also clearly had a plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this film is somewhat untouched. It does not look so soft, genuine or innocent as it is in the original - which is a sort of idea to be a bad seductress and why not. The other performances range from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a sure-fire director - one who does not always do a great job, but manages to make valuable movies) has officially given the first true turkey; a movie so bad that people laughed at certain moments that were going to be serious. I have heard that the film has gone through several editing sessions, and it's very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh! He talks about stupid and unbelievable. However, I saw "Gigli," I saw "The mask of the mask" - and although I do not want to "snatch" this movie, I can say with my authority (you do not do it, I have to agree, I mean, I like the two movies about this catastrophic failure. By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started, and the people in the theater started throwing things off the screen during a particularly scandalous and insulting scene inside a nightclub type orgy. <br /> <br /> "The basic instinct 2" - essentially, he also moves.
