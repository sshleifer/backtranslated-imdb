This mischievous adaptation probably of one of the weaker novels Martin Amis fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as Recviem for a dream or something written by Irvine Walsh because he is struggling to decide whether he is a shiny cartoon -stick or a hyper-realistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> directed by Marsh's boring Marsh in over-saturated nuances, a public school group abandon converging into a mansion waiting for the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of drug use decadent. Besides the ridiculous sub-plot of the soon-to-be-the-main-nonsense plot about a cult extremist group that expresses with the violent crimes of the elite figures of the world, be it political or spoiled. In the first drum you know exactly where this happens. <br /> <br /> What is a talented actor Paul Bettany does in this tedious, badly written hole? He did before bringing him to fame and Jennifer Connelly can be assured that he was offered this trash now he would be agents immediately changed! Avoid.
