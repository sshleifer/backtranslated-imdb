I feel blessed to have what is called the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made. I knew we had something special when Steven opened his mouth and somebody else's voice came out. In the middle of the film, my eyes began to hurt, and I nearly fell from the chair with an uncontrollable laugh. Steven is Steven (with an ever-changing voice) and absolutely unbelievable in his role (As always). Who the hell let people with the pony-sized poneillose shapes, anyway? He is also always written in totally incredible love interests with women at least 20 years of junior. Supporting actors show that they were shot in the dark - btw, shot this film in the dark only with a torch for light? <br /> <br /> This is truly abominable in every possible way. Invite all your friends around you and make a social event of it - really special.
