The only thing I can remember about this movie is two things: first, at the age of twelve, I even thought it was embarrassed. Secondly, it was so bad that when Mad magazine made a parody about her, they dropped off the front page and wrote a note of responsibility at the bottom of the page saying they completely disapproved it. Want to see the wonderful comedies of this time, try Animal House. It is so bad and vulgar that it reduces to the high art. Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray, before becoming an annoying charm, with great lines like Carl Spackler's goalkeeper "Check me if Sandy is wrong, but if I kill all golfers" close and throw the key.
