We were excited to see the ads for this movie, because I recently read the book and I really liked it. The film, however, did not answer my expectations. After reading the book, I recently prepared to be unleashed, as is often the case when stories are translated into movies. Characters did not seem to fit the book very well. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There is no real connection with the spectator about what is happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what is happening. It just seemed slapped and rushing. Overall, I was very disappointed with the film. I suppose if you did not read the book, you might be alone. At least, it might attract you to read the book, which you probably will enjoy more. <br /> <br />
