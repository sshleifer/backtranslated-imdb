A group of extremely stubborn holes are tormented by the bay puppets that some elderly elders have kept locked in a vault for 20 years for no reason. Many people know this movie just from MST3K's spot-on ribbons on the film. But I saw the real movie and I can say for sure that yes it is bad, really, REALL bad. From one of the most terrible "battle" scenes I've ever seen of "extraterrestrial" toys stuffed with a lack of movement (we had a monster of animals that was more frightening) to terrible acting a monster of animals the company that was more charismatic) However, saying that Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" movies are somehow, and believe me I have no earthly idea how much worse. That does not mean that this movie is nothing but stupidity, because it is not. Just throwing him there. Eye candy: no nudity in the movie itself but there are 2 pairs of tits in the DVD Introduction to my movie Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Image Gallery and Trailer for this movie
