Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century. Long before the Scary Movie series there were some examples of this kind, especially in the '80s. But, as the franchise said, most of these movies are hit or lost. Some like "Elvira, the Master of Darkness" rises above, but others like "Saturday 14" and the sequel fail to deliver laughs. But of all these types of movies there is a big crime and this is "Transylvania 6-5000", a great waste of time for many reasons. Pro: A great distribution that does the best. Some of the dopey humor is fun. A horn, but catch a theme song. Some good locations in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Cons: thread plot. Very boring pacing. Most humor does not cut it. Monsters do not get too much to do and little screen time. Did I think this should be a monster movie doll? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry. Final thoughts: Is this a comedy? If so then why are the really funny bits so few and far between them? The comedies should make us roll on the floor, let us not breath our eyes and quit, trying to finish. I can not believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk. I admit it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it does not deserve any time or money, even if you're a fan of any actor. See "Transylvania Twist". <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
