He does not laugh at all. Yeah, I saw this whole train, but only so I would not even wonder if Cleese would have figured out in the last part. (No, he did not.) It might be interesting for you, historically, to see that British "humor" includes "black jokes" like these, thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What amazes me even more is to read the comments of the other commentators, who admit that this is not very good, but then come back and give it high votes. If the vast majority of comedies you've seen are even worse than that, then I definitely love torture. <br /> <br /> The humor of this show appears for young children, but the subject is not. So, who is that for? People who enjoy repetitive repetitions and drawn by doubles, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting just like a short trip back in '77), and other "low" humor. The Three Stoogi are still funny and they were my children. They have made some effort in making jokes of work. However, this is removed from the shock. I'm afraid it's the end of civilization, if these things are really accepted as valuable. You keep telling me that tabloid television is popular. :(
