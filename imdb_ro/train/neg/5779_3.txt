I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw a name for this title and the genre I thought great, it could be very good ... some song parodies or other gore films ... but .. then I read a preview and thought it could be good anyway ... but it was not ... my opinion: if in the movies look a little like a documentary, with a little comedy try some Moore movies or Alien autopsy, they are really about something. it was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy in the title ... without any comment ... very bad joke
