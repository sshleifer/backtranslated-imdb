The dramatic show of a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway), which is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - to which her younger sister (played by Mariel), whose music teacher, is presented. While the central court action draws attention - largely due to an interpretation by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway's lawyer - the film is often glossy and dramatically unconvincing: the jury appreciates the musician's part because a) to the sensual nature of the profession, and b) did not offer any resistance to her alleged aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and saw her inadvertently in bed. What is f ***?!; it was clearly linked - what resistance could realistically provide? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film - which involves Sarandon's sister rape, who curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE (2002) in a tunnel - is quite contradictory: Mariel's character ought to have known more better than to trust Sarandon after what she did for her sister, but Margaux resolutely resumed the line of work that led indirectly to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The climax - where Sarandon only takes his desserts and Margaux suddenly turns into a fearless, vigilant vigilant - is nevertheless a delight in DEATH WISH (1974); Usually, Ubiquitous Italian filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis has been behind both films. It is worth noticing how the life of the two sisters of Hemingway had a different wild transformation (this was the debut of both): Margaux's career has never taken (despite its undeniable aspect of commendable participation here), while Mariel was soon to receive an Academy Award nomination for MANHATTAN (1979) by Woody Allen, and, interestingly, would have played a woman full of charm when he played the real Playboy role of Dorothy Stratten in STAR 80 1983) by Bob Fosse. With the increased pressure of several failed marriages, Margaux fled into alcohol and eventually died of a drug overdose in 1996; the Hemingway family had a history of suicide - especially the grandfather of the sisters, the famous author Ernest, who died of a 1961 shoot-out injury.
