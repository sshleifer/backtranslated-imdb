The overheated plan of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from a minor novel by Francoise Sagan, who has become the best seller, though God knows why. For adolescents who want to escape a parent-parent potential, they may have a particular appeal. Do not take into account that David Niven plays the role of playboy father and Deborah Kerr, mother-in-perspective. Unfortunately, too much relies on Jean Seberg's brothers shoulders. It is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is she can hit pictures, but she can not act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of the Arc in Otto Preminger's first film, "St. Joan-Seberg," knows he was incapable of having a 19-year-old film. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was her second film; she was 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could offset Seberg's lack of action? No chance? Seberg's character is at the heart of the story, and quite convincing though he can be physically at the age of 17, can not meet the emotional requirements of the role. I do not know if she has ever become a successful actress in her short life because she had no impact on my consciousness in her pictures later. But whoever thinks this movie is better than mediocre needs a taste test. In spite of Niven and Kerr, it remains a minor story minorially executed by a beautiful young woman who needed lesson lessons.
