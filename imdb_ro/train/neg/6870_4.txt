A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Ren√©e Zellweger), the wife of the devoted scholar of Talmudic Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply dissatisfied. Mendel Sender's brother (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field where she is already an expert gem. She also starts a business with her, and when she spends her time with a Puerto Rican artist she escapes her and betrays her to the family, which stops her. There's a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her, and she seems to be a woman of magical beggar, but why is not clear. Many are unclear, unfortunately, including what happens to Sonja, why Rebe tells her that there is a fire inside her and maybe she is not from God, and what that means and what the woman of the magic beggar tells her. To a certain extent, the story touches the situation of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly released. Nor the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another well-thought race. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman, and yet it is the bastard Sender who quotes Sonja. Zellweger is fighting the side; she should be Jewish from the middle of the sunset, and sometimes her focus is flat, and sometimes she is taken up by the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She is at her best when she is hard and taking the toll, but eventually the movie is a mess.
