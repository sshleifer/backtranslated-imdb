To be honest, I knew what to expect before I see this movie and I have to say it has the worst act I've ever seen. It has moments and a level of comedy very fun, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There are a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were bad and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (who would go there anyway?), But I did not care about that moment, because I was amused costumes, and bad CGI. As for B movies, this is worth the title of "being so bad, good" and "kudos" to film makers, as they probably knew what they were doing. Maybe these movies continue .....
