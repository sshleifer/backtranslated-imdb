Jeff Lowell has written and directed "Her dead body" badly. The idea is first and foremost, it is as old as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is almost nothing attractive in this movie. Eve looks great like ever and offers pleasing performance. Paul Rudd seems to be jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. It looks male and offers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, like Lindsay Sloane. I was expecting more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I did not have fun.
