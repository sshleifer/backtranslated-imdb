What is most striking about this semi-musical set in Berlin in the 1920s is the wonderful cinema and editing. It's the top of the First National line in these departments. The story is easy to engage and resemble the plots of Miller's two other films (SUNNY, SALLY), in which a working girl is romanated by a rich boy, with family disapproval, complications and finality. All four musical numbers are bold at the beginning of the movie and we are going for a long time without any musical flotation. Miller sings a part of Think about the kid and repeats for you. There are also NOT NEVER blue and you are not the first. Miller here is very engaged and delightful, quite remember Irene Dunne in the way and delivery. Sad does not dance it's her force. SALLY remains his best film, the weakest being the second and SUNNY pretty poor, with a very low rank. Her life was tragically traced by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies prevented. It is worth visiting these films to see Ziegfeld's top star in the 1920s.
