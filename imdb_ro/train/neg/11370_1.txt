This video contains a way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It is a shame that the people who did it really believe that the American people are so stupid to believe in it, maybe as an American citizen, every person has to protest against this kind of nonsense. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... THE QUIET IS PUBLIC! you can read it yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not really related. The music used at some points prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what's going on there. They use images that are shifted from their original content. To finish the comment, I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think you can make the same movie exactly with every religion in the world?
