Launched on DVD in the UK as Ax, Choke is a teen glory that fails in almost all departments: the story is almost nonexistent, resulting in a movie that includes mostly people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (obviously destined to survive the film), everyone is completely doubtful, which means that the viewer can not care less when he is sacrificed; deaths are not quite heavy (unless a short blow of one pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns into a stomach); and the free scene of the sex scene has no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to do in a weak shot!). The thin plume comes with members of a punk band blocked inside what seems to be the world's biggest nightclub (there are corridors and abandoned endless rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are taken by an unseen attacker. For a low budget effort, production values ​​are fine, and distribution seems to be quite capable actors, but not with enough real scams, a reluctance to become really messy (this is a slasher, so where is the chart ?), a too terrible dialogue (especially from the drummer who did not die soon) and some inappropriate video techniques in an attempt to add a particular style, the movie is quickly becoming extremely boring.
