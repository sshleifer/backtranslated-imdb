Except for the recognition of some beautiful cinemas, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the dilemma of the protagonist if he must stay with his childhood friends in the world of misery or leave them and take their own lives. The "emotionally powerful" abundant scenes do not go with this plot, and because of the bad action they also fail to create the desired atmosphere. The director only succeeds in introducing Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. Characters do not seem to evolve, though it is difficult to talk about any character ... except for Sonny. In addition to it, the actors do not manage to play much, and when some of them have to deal as self-indulgent amateurs. I wonder what destroyed the film more: the superficial scenario, throwing away all the potential of the plot or bad action, disrupting any call that might be left.
