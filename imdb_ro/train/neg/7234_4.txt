In a word: aggressive. I was advised to read a few articles about the philosophical significance of the film afterwards, but after I placed the film at interminibility for 115 minutes and was slowly crushed under the swollen symbolism and the lava-like oppression I found it better to I report my reactions to the movie. After all, who's going to see a movie with a program in hand? And this movement was bleak. The main actor, Claude Laydu, from the opening of the film to the end of the film, carries the same mask of tiring and annoying agony as practically indistinguishable from the eternal and unlucky voice of the film. Filming on each other could work better than subjecting an audience both because basically say the same priest of Ambricourt is a miserable human being. The story of a persecuted priest who tries to help a wealthy, disturbing family does nothing to make his characters interesting or sympathetic as the family is a bunch of weird strangers, and the priest himself. The last 30 minutes suggest a disgusting message about the grace and suffering of a man equal to that of others, but because of all the terrible worries of a Laydu sufferer of the vague subtext of Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was finally over , have some ice cream. Interesting for Brother Bresson's fans, Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and setting Schrader had in his own scenes and movies, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
