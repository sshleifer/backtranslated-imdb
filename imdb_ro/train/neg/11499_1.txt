Gadar is a really bad movie because he says a false story. It's too unrealistic and it's a typical unscrewing film that aims to bash Pakistan. The purpose of the film is to guide viewers to believe that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own flaws will not work. And all the songs and the music of the movie are all bad. Most likely, the Sikhs will love the movie because they are wrong. The movie is shit and shit with power. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10 I would be, but the lowest is 1. Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this silly boring movie.
