Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. He was known to save the movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget, and its production values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for Christopher's love .... avoid this movie!
