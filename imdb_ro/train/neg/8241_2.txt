This movie has many problems associated with it, which makes it disappear as a low budget class project from someone in the film school. I have to give her credit for her campaign. Many times throughout the movie I found myself hysterically laughing. It was so bad at times it was comic, which made a fun watch. If you are looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a laugh, then throw a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is almost impossible to follow over time and the soundtrack is a bit like that.
