This must be one of the worst movies I've seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the pathetic scenario and the biggest question is how this rather low leaf script has come through the selection process. all sorts of movies from deep dramas to most-oriented male kill everything you see the movie type, so I can not say I'm pretentious. I'm trying to find something to compare, but I can not think of anything that corresponds to that, maybe the troop troops. 2. The witchcraft, in my opinion, makes the gods cry and think about throwing my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are wonderful. The gorgeous actor and script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a fun way, folks is not one of those who kills your soul for a minute.
