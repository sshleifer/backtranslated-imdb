The original film (dated 19?) Did not show any "monster", but just SUGGESTED "frightening" things. This version, however, showed every aspect of an "evil mind", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "The Mystery," as presented in the original movie, was the most frightening part: one simply did not know what caused the weird things that had happened. Showing the face of the old man, this gentleman has completely disappeared. Even worse: the special effects (weeping the faces of wooden children) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, too obviously spectacular to be almost as scary as the original
