The movies have gone to sleep before, but no movie has done that twice, so I had to finish it for three weeks. Dialogue was bad. The women talked with style and the men were caricatures. And two of the alleged Japanese women looked at the Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with clear Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmental men have been sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 is equal to a difficult choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two?
