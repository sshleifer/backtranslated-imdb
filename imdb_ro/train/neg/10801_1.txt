Now, I'm one to watch movies that have received poor reviews, and say, "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and I imagined that my Big Fat Independent Film was great. Note that I did not start to follow her with high hopes, but I thought maybe ... maybe ... it would be bad to kind of laugh at her. I was wrong. At no time, during my suffering through this "film" (And I use this term in a bigger way), I was almost close to being slightly entertained. To begin, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I know, an Amish priest would probably be a rapper better than him. The main character is simply annoying and not an easy-to-understand person. Quite frankly, I'd rather eat a bunch of fat from a bloody root of Harlequin than let me look at it again.
