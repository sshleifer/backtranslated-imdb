Like someone who was staggered at the incredible images of the "hero", I was anxious to see this movie that was billed as being in the same line, but better. I also liked an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both aspects. I bought the DVD of this unseen movie, and that was a mistake. It was not better. I realized that these martial arts movies fly through the air are a pure fantasy, but this story is stretched so far from any credible remotely that I just made myself shake my head in disappointing disappointment. A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that goes a little. Also, the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, stupid look on his face and stupid laughter that ruined the movie. Despite the wonderful colors and stunning action scenes, this story - for me - just did not have an appeal to turn it into a movie that deserves to hold. This movie is not my "hero"!
