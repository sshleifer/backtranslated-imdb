In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee has a lot in mind. He thinks about the color of racism, the mass media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "heterosexism", drug war policy, etc. <br /> <br /> This level of consciousness is its own wonderful. I think it is a blessing that more and more people choose to critically examine the fundamental aspects of our everyday life; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee makes contentious films does not make him a good film maker. What happens in "jungle fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two main failures: First, Lee simply tries too much. It seems desperately trying to host any political / social statement he can think of in 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems confused and indecisive, because he never allows time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts stereotypes, and we are left with hasty testimonies and highly charged dialogues. The end result is very scenic and unrealistic. Secondly, by trying to make statements about such a large variety of social functions, he does not seem to have a concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What happens is a puddle of regrettable non-sense. You feel he has bought an elementary level sociology book and has escaped all 500 pages. These are extremely problematic features, because the art of the film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a speaker for his voice the director's voice. He is not able to distance themselves from work and let them speak for themselves. It does not work either as a piece of art or as a solid political argument. Lee still appreciates these important issues, I have to say: Two fingers down.
