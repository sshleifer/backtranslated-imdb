You would not expect a movie like this to be good and it is not. It's a no-noise movie, extremely violent, filmed with a bad camera by hand ... and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and show up in their terrible and hilarious reading. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find was that a government experiment escaped, and a group of zombies seems to terrorize a few families. The gore effects are actually some of the sickest ones I've ever seen. It seems that gore effects have searched a butcher for all parts of the body and many scenes involve zombies that dismantle people and eat their organs. It's a funny and disgusting movie, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
