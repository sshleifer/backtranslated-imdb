As has been said many times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is not a remake of the 1980s (generally ignored) of 1977's Wes Craven's original. But wishing to offer this postmodern postmodern official stamp of Reduction Reduction , Craven himself (a double threat with his son, Jonathan) decided to enter a movie of the same quality - in English, ORIBLE. Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja and is clearly in his head - yet wonders how someone could have created a movie that can be watched on Craven's Writing 101 scrawl screen. Not only do the characters (in this case, a goofball guy who sent the national guards to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) are completely unpleasant and prone to annoying traps (played without a spoon of irony) but they constantly crack jokes that are not funny. After seeing their total inertia during a training exercise, their fate against repulsive cannibals, roaming is painfully obvious. Only in this time - as in the original sequel of the 1980s - the scenario is so simplistic (actually, in fact) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of raising an ante in repulsive shocks (we are treated to a combo -murder during opening credits, plus a free rape for those who did not bring the DVD in the middle!). Even the mutants from this trip are some strange freaks that have no memorable stature - the sticky, rubbery look of the FX looks like the rest of the movie to try to hide its face from embarrassment. I was really surprised at the surprise of the blade at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent film, and the producers literally broke to break at the end of Hills 2, setting the scene - very enjoyable to set the scene - for a third installment. .. however, Craven and Weisz created a movie that is so cynical that the 1977-06 version worked so it would be hard to find an audience after that insulting palm.
