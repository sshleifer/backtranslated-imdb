This movie was quite absurd. There were some funny parts. I'm going straight into the binoculars of the movies in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... that the movie had some funny parts, but generally a pretty ridiculous plot (or a lack of)." /> I thought it seemed that Ben was trying a little too much to be a funny boy. And I did not understand how he was a multi-millionaire made by himself and another idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. He does some nonsense, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I did not think Gigli was all his fault, I like it in general. I think it's kind of like a baby he's sorry because he can not seem to do it well. My advice would be to avoid this movie. It did not really develop into a functional plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not as well used as they could. They deserve better. Generally, this movie is not home alone, it's not a Christmas story, not a Christmas holiday or any other classic. Forgotten forever.
