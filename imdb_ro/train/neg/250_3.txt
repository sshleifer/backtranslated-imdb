After seeing three other versions of the same movie, I'm afraid that for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather boring and lively performance. His emotions are so gentle that he makes it difficult to get involved in the film. Alistair Sim played the infinitely better role. When Scrooge was the worst, you do not understand that Scott says the dialogue with much conviction, and when he suffers his metamorphosis he is not equally convincing. I can not think of the actors in this movie that match those of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and honest Muppets) to take this out are better executed. Very disappointing.
