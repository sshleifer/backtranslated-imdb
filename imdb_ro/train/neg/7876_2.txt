In a group discussion that I attended after watching this film, filmmakers said they should not look at this film but as a film but as a provocative thought. Well, the only thoughts that have occurred to me have been overwhelmed by watching the movie. Film tricks (documentary style, futuristic decoration) served as a distraction of what was to be a careful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring film that preaches the choir.
