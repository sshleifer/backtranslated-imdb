It's like having the general themes of The Obvious Suspect and Fightclub, getting your style and class and blending them together with a lot of pretentious new wave "I'm Intellectual, So My Movie Should Be Hard to Make Sense" Movie production rubbish, stone in a few extra styles for a good measure, chopped from the end, there's Revolver. Yes, I thought a little about this after watching and making sense, however, that does not stop being garbage. Waste of money. Waste of time. Above, as the worst film I've ever seen, without even a novelty value of the bad movie to redeem it a little.
