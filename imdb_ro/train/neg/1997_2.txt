This version is probably available at the local DVD dollar store. The printer is not great or the sound, but if you have 1.00 and 90 minutes available, you will get the money worth (which does not mean too much). Anna Neagle is extremely vague like Nanette. Whatever it was their charm that day, they are not obvious in this film. In this movie (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden) a great number of fine character actors appear, but the material is remarkably weak of their talent. However, it is interesting to see how these artists are able to make the most of lean writing. The musical numbers (there are only two) are pretty horrible. Clearly, the studio did not feel obliged to resort to the rich musicality of the original "No, no, Nanette". For what it deserves, the DVD can be taken for $ 1.00. It's worth it so much to say you saw her.
