How many of these fake "slice" movies have to be made? Hopefully not too many. Victor Vargas's raise is a very conscious attempt by director Peter Solett, who has attracted the attention of Hollywood. There is nothing wrong with this in general. What's wrong with this movie is, in particular, that it ignores audiences and pilots in every clich√© in the Hollywood independent production book, which is supposed to be a "edie". It is supposed to be "real" the "documentary style" of the room, except that no documentary will shake the camera for purposes ... <br /> <br /> It's "edgy" so never to lose light film. It's "hip", so let's use the kids to swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... And so on and so forth. All you have left is a very conscious attempt to impress Hollywood, which will not impress anybody out of the rare "crowded" crowd that seems to still admit all the bad movies.
