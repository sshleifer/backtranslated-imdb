It's a bad, very bad movie. Well, for people, real realistic film is a good thing. It's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, ugly, trivial, meaningless at times. Perhaps this is why people say this movie is real. Too many common places: you are black, you are a murderer, you are condemned and cursed, whatever you do, you will end up by shooting or shot by someone; do not let children play with weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to the church and then they are good, very good ... Before that, I did not see such a bad movie. This is why I have never noticed how important photography is in a movie. In this case, every scene shot during the day outdoors is clearly and annoyingly blue. They were not even careful to correct the color balance. Oh! We've rated more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is the lowest of all time.
