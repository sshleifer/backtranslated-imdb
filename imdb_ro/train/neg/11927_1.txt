Undoubtedly, the worst movie I have seen a long time ago. I have suffered to the end, because there must be something here, but not. The plan, when it does not deal with clich√©s, returns to the point of nonexistence; the dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed; characters do not grow beyond sketches; The sets are clustered. Worse, given its co-director, the picture is just that. Comments elsewhere that raise this up with Get Carter, Long Long Friday or Kaspar Hauser are far from the mark; The lives of the saints do not have an innovation, that is, their depth and shading. In short, their craft. A ruthless editor might probably send him a decent 30-minute gap, but, as is the case, is a fifteen-film project on a one-million-pound scale; rambling and swollen with his own claims. That he received funding (surely only because of Rankin's name), while other small films that fight for money are depressing for the British cinema industry.
