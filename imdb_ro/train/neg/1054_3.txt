Rural family drama - perhaps with a hint of "The ordinary people" - refers to a boy who retreats to himself after he fatally injures his older brother in a shooting accident. In spite of the fact that there was not a fearsome theme (given the cruel treatment of director Christopher Cain), there is a dynamic in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of adults to handle the situation make the film a joyful experience. What's up with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the film, the film is almost a small meeting of "The Natural". Too bad that this project did not get the talent needed behind the camera to really find an exciting and memorable picture. * 1/2 from ****
