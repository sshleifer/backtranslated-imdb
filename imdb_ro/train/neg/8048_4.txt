Suppose you've been on a deserted island in the last ten years. They have not heard of Scream and left when Halloween Part 1 entered the cinema. Then this movie would have been an explosion and a completely new vision on the scene of horror. Currently, a rating of 2.7 is on IMDb and does not deserve such a low appreciation. Slashing all the way, like "I know what you did," and who-is-like when you finally get me convinced of who and why. a nice movie to watch with a cola, popcorn popcorn and no desire to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If video rental does not fit into the top titles, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I've seen much worse.
