This is the worst piece of nonsense we've seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is bad, the dialogues make no sense, the humorous scenes have never heard of the real humor. The actors do not play, the worse they do not even try. The script itself is somewhat in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this movement, fights. They are well choreographed as expected from the guys in Hong Kong and are the only motivation to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I think fighting should fill the gap, so the screenwriter does not bother thinking about the story. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from following it all the way. Avoid it if you are not the fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
