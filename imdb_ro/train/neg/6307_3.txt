I'm going to give it 3 just because it showed the history we need to know, to prevent this from happening again. I agree with the comments of the British. The movie was pretty awful. All the clich√©s, no real plot. Historical and technical inexhaustities abound. Look at the technical specifications on DE 529 or any Everts Class Destroyer Escort and you'll see what I mean. Now I have a black history in the United States and I will be called a racist just to say this, but the history of this ship is not so great. They made an escort, followed a "submarine" that turned out to be a bullet that beat him. Sorry, but the black people did much more during the Second World War, then this foolish movie gives them credit. This movie makes them look like gold. Leave the calling name to start, I get it.
