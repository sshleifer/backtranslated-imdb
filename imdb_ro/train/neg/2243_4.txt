It's not even worth a review, other than a warning to potential spectators. It's a somewhat generic story about an actress who haunts a studio while filming a World War II antique drama. There is no fear involved, no suspense, no surprises. A shocking moment that looks a little too bad to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there is a very beautiful editing from time to time. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a total bust. 4/10.
