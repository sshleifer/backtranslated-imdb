Everyone involved (and the audience) should look for the "Candidate" to see how good this movie could have been. What happened to the story in South America? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking about letting their roles be cardboard cuts. Until now I liked all the performance and / or film of Gene Hackman. He was either disinterested (whom I hardly believe) or terrible. I also liked and defended Richard Gere (and was vilified for that). But here he had no "power". He was never intimidating and occasionally convincing. Generally, I was very disappointed. I was really expecting more from this director and cast. If you can not find the "Candidate" watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
