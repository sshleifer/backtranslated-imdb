This film must be the darkest, worst, most retarded monster movie ever. It is a total joke that it even appeared in theaters. It's kind of looking at the Loch Ness monster in West America. This movie deserves to be thrown into a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame for you. The people involved in this rubbish must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before filming. How else can you explain the total and profound stupidity that this bucket of nonsense contains. Do not miss a minute of your life watching this. Do not even waste your time to submit a review.
