On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil's child might be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in Exorcist, when girls are possessed or devils, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, she was crushed. Delia does not make me think she could be a devil child, rather she is a troubled child. Problems that only a therapist, rather a priest, could help. Does not look scary or devil. Rather, she looks dizzy and moody. This movie had potential, and if it was made by the same people who made the three previous films, they could work. But it is rather insulting to make a continuation of one of the most favored trilogies of horror, as a special film for television. On so many levels are left down. It is an inexpensive aspect, the act is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. Characters do not bring any sympathy, and do not look for them. I recently saw it again after somebody brought it to me for Christmas and gave it a scary one. If you think about that, then I would suggest you do not do that. Watch one of the others, watch the Exorcist, or watch the Good Son. Just do not waste your time with this move!
