The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I do not know if that was intentional or not, but if you had giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shown. But these were the only chicks the movie has come to. Not that he wanted to chuckle, it's a horrible movie for God's name! A terrible movie in many ways. It is a shame that such a premise was wasted by horrible moments and even unbearable for the spectator (certainly not for the weak of the Heart!)! Nor was it necessary to show all the things that are presented. I do not even get into a moral obligation (because movies do not really have such a task or function), the discussion about what is presented here, but this is a further decline in the "torture movement" that has grown in the past several years!
