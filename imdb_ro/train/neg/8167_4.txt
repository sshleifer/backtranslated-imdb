Forest is not just your daily chocolate standard, it also has an interesting mixture of supernatural elements. The story is about two couples who climb the forest on a camping trip. A dwelling in the cave, the cannibal shepherds and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them. There is something you do not see any of the Slavs. Director Don Jones gets an "A" effort, although the film itself collapses almost every level, the act is simply the medium except Jeanette Kelly, who plays the dead wife of the forester (Michael Brody, known as Gary Kent) . /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful pictures of a pair of hiking through a valley and a forest. They realize too late that someone is following them. These are both shipped in the usual tariff. Our killer uses a reliable hunting knife for the duration of the movie, except for a replica when he implements a saw, a fork, and a rusty cloth to send his spouse's lover's boyfriend. The forest has a good story, but the movie just does not work along with it I found pretty boring with just crappy acting. 4/10
