This film had mediocrity, laziness and misunderstanding written everywhere. If you are going to make a movie about vampires, which has been done thousands of times already, then it would be good to do a good job. I will be the first to say that this film has not just cut him off. Some scary / horror movies fail to break the mold "allows you to do something forbidden and left for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies." This, unfortunately, was no different, and like all the frightening movies, once you ventured on that road it does not return. And the end? How do heroes do the same thing everywhere and along the movie, but then mysteriously ends at this point and can not do the job in the end? The end was very anticlimatic and wrote part 3 that I will never follow. Horrible movie.
