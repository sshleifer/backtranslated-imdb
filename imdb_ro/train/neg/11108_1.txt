Where to start. The movie started pretty well, but after 30 minutes I caught my watch. Horror at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story came in. It has become stupid and worse than the time ticked by. The actors gave an average performance in this movie, however, I received a bit bored of Vinny Jones continually stuck in the movie. As the film fired and took my word for him, he dragged him, it was just getting taken more and more. SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie could not get worse, towards the end of the uploads, if they appeared skeletal monsters, just to eat deaths that made no sense. It turned out to be a kind of meat that eats worship, and good boys die at the end. The end actually just made me laugh how bad it was. Once the main role has Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. In the end, this movie made Creep look the best horror film ever made. I gave her a star because the feminine leadership did a pretty good job, but even she could not save this wreck of a train!
