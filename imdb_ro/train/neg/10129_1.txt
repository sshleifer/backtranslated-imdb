I barely find the words to express how terrible this movie is. I was sold with the promise of action, with Segal and stealth planes, which normally make a fun action movie. I can say honestly that I'd rather throw my eyes with a cocktail stick than see this movie again. The act was so terrible it was almost funny. The story was poorly brawny, with so many cavernous holes that you could fly a F117 through them. The script was so poor, if I learned that a 10-year-old has written it, I should not be at least surprised. Direction and production are so amateur, I would not even hire these people to shoot the worst wedding film. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this film have cheaper art and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never show his face in public, I can not imagine what made him agree with this movie, the worst movie I've seen in my entire life.
