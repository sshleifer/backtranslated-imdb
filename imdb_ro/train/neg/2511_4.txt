Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-intentioned but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) trying to catch his wife (Ryan) scientific with Tim Robbins, to make her relax and enjoy life in the years 1950. Because Ryan likes Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is nice, but the movie collapses with cornea and a stupid dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the famous singer who support the best efforts to keep this bad comedy, but fail to save the movie. Unfortunate that such great talent led to the production of such a bad film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
