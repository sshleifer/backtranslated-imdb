This must come down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. A terrible scenario, horrible scenario ... and there were good points! One to be surely miss you! The banknotes, if you could say so, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to distract her from acting as plastic! I was willing to give her a chance, hoping to improve who, unfortunately, did not! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you set yourself up for a good read! I like Denise Richards, that's why I gave a movie, but why she let it be distributed in this movie is beyond me!
