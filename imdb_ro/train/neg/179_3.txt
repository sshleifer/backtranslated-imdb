Go back to Cabin by the Lake just ... it was missing. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some quality video and simple camcorders. It makes for a very strange mixture! I think he should have found a way of not doing the "home video" effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you saw the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL ... you will never want to see it if you see it first! It will probably look too cheese and will even disable your care of the original one.
