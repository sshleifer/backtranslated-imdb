Robert DeNiro plays the most illiterate illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. Dialogue is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a self-made cartoon, not a funny one. The film moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an inappropriate manner, and is predictably unbearable. It also connects to every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but what? Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule to request ten lines for each review. When a movie is worthless, there is no need for ten lines of text to allow other readers to know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
