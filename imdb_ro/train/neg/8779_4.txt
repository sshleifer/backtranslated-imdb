As a fan of the White Noise cinema it was a total disappointment, as a director, the cinema was good enough, beautifully lighted, a good work on the camera, a reasonable direction. But as a movie, it seems to have been as predictable as all other "so-called" horror films that the market has recently flooded. Although it had a little cooling factor, the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem credible. This film did not explain the reasons for some events, but continued with them. The actress was far from blowing the mind of the main character portrayed without emotion, like many recent thriller / horror films. Surely not a movie I buy on DVD and would not recommend anyone to rush to see it.
