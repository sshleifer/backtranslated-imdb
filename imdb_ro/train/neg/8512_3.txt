I like the silent movies, but that was a little too moronic. As much as I want to say he deserved the hour I got up, I can not. I do not think that any version of the movie is even approaching the book. And do not try the kids, they might be weird. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the laws of labor were different then ... BUT ON THE PEOPLE.
