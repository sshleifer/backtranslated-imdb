Not only did they mistaken all the characters, not only the voices suck, not only that the writers need seriously to get their girlfriends, not only that the designs are really cruel, but it seems to have been created mainly for ages 1 -6 years. The only episode I've ever seen about this show that kept me looking was "A Matter Of Family," because I liked the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of the animated Batman series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is a friend of Harvey Dent, right? Over a story of two episodes, he turns into the improbable villain, TwoFace. In the Show, Bruce is a friend of that guy Ethan and over a two-episode story, he turns into the wrong ClayFace villain. This was just a small example (That may not be true), but in short, this is the biggest test on a series of Batman. And that says something.
