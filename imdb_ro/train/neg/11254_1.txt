"Captain Sky and Tomorrow's World" (an amazingly funny title) is simply a bad movie; it has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. Yes, the CGI background looks interesting, but the result is that everything is shot in an unpleasant focus. In addition, the movie uses music just like "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - never stops. Terribly, simply terrible. There are no fresh ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc, bit taken from movies and older series. There is no goalkeeper here, the movie seems to exist because it can. Save your money and time. I have no fun.
