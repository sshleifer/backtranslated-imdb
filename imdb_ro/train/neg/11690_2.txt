It's a waist to indulge in such big actors in such a weak and boring film. In addition to all the unanswered questions in the other comments, what is so difficult about catching the thieves? You just have to remove the bankers, see who was at the bank - from all the camera registration angles - before the robbers came in and you have among the most villains among the hostages. Where is the suspense that every body speaks about? It was so obvious when the soldiers were asked to turn into the identical uniform, so that everyone was going out the front door ... they had seen it several times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could associate his film with a good score of music and artistic film. The movie is not worth it. Quick!
