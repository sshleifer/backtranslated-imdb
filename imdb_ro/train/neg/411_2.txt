Normally, I do not feel too much of an incentive to comment on movies I do not like, but in a case like this, I have to say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many flaws in the story that I do not even feel compelled to develop because it's time to go out of this experience. But the most annoying point is that at no point in the movie does anyone explain if the motives for the madness of Bacon's character are due to a power journey or a physiological reaction to his condition. the effects are impressive and Paul Verhoeven has done some good things in the past (Robocop's cutting on DVD is great). However, this film is bad and generally does not come close to explaining the layout or technical aspect of the subject and, instead, is solving for predictable action without enjoying it. In short, just as many other reviews here say (I want to read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
