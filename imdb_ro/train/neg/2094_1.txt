I had to survive aging pain, high school and family conflict for almost all the show. I really do not care about high school girls who fear their relationships. I spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and I'm not interested in anything about fictitious adolescents who go through "lite" versions of the horrors we have endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show. Finally, we see a Proto-Cylon. It was good, but with one problem. Its red point would be blocked on an object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedotics always scan back and forth, giving the car a map of the world. The red object never stops moving forward and backward. I hope that the writers will remedy this abuse before the second episode.
