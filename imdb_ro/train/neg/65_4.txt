I do not really get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was really kind to give it a 4 out of 10. What else would have been a wonderful story with a whole or a few more decent actors becoming a total farce in my eyes. There are so many cliques in that movement, women's hair is terrible and most scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There is no real passion in this movie, but a bunch of actors that act beyond any limit that hurts. It's not funny to be a comedy, it's too fake and sad to touch, so it's not okay in my eyes. Following her, I could not believe that this made my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was ok and was lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen and certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
