you have to see my comments on several movies in Evren Buyruk .. I'm out to make another comment on a movie that does not even worth a minute to talk ... This movie is actually two hours by the character of Dafoe drinking - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough clues or character knowledge to surprise you. It was just a bleak and bleak loss of time. Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But the movie was sucked. Slow does not make the bad movie, it was just bad. The storyline mixed with artistic details of anamorphic details is not consistently drawn in a meaningful way for a plot, except for highlighting ghosts that are illustrated from many perspectives, eventually at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it made me sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and I had to watch the movie - which was even more disappointing.) Generally, I do not like to comment negatively or comment on the works of others, even when sucking, but this movie has justified one . It is too bad that these great actors were ashamed of this final result.
