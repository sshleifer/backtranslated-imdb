Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visibly incredibly animated movie in the current home theater version. Artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this film a vision by virtue of just the images. And now, for the bad news. I really say that when I say animation is the only thing this movie has. You may remember that "Spirit" was wrongly hurt by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who claims to have been because Disney is better established and has a better publicity can write me a four-page essay entitled "Why" Lilo and Stitch's Script did not Stink. "/> For All Technologies The incredible new animation displayed in "Spirit", the story is almost * amazingly boring.There is a lesson here and (to uselessly say) not only applies to animated movies.You can have the most wonderful visual effects ever to show the eyes of a mortal , but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we do not care about your characters, it's bad to shoot It's just like this Animation is still mined I can not wait to see what one does with more imagination.
