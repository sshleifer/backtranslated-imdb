If you have not seen the gong television series, then you will not enjoy this movie at all, not because you know the series makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 5 out of 10, because a few things make it a funny thing that helps to clear its obvious problems. 1) It's a funny snapshot of it was advanced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You have many funny cameos of people you've seen in the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he does not make his personality with the TV. 4) You will notice a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of strange things, just as you see on the TV show. I will not list all the bad things because there are many, but here are some of the most prominent ones. 1) The Gong Show has many real clips that get tired at the length of the movie. 2) The story line of the movie outside the clip segments is very poor and basically consists of a single plotting point. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most other actors do a typical flatness in the 1970s. It's a good movie to watch when you do not have the hour and a half you want to watch at all times. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even then it's not that good. ;)
