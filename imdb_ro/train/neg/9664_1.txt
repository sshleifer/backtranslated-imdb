This movie based on books is really terrible and a great disappointment. I've been waiting for this move for over a month. Many movie commentators have been hopeful about it. Also in newspapers and television, it made a lot of sense. When April 29, many people have regretfully noticed that the movie is really terrible. Why? First of all, the story was so monotonous. There were many undefined scenes, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on. Actresses from Hulya Avsar were not in harmony with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts better in comedy films, in this film, a sort of drama, she could not give up her previous role. And finally the movie is too short, just 66 minutes.
