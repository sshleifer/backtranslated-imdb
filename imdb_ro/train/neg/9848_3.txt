This film has some noirist and neo-realistic visual effects, and tells a story that has no rejuvenation of the Hollywood sugar layer, which was possible only because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes take too long (especially the wedding) and I found the exaggerated action and unrealistic dialogue to be more suitable for the scene than for the silver screen. Dialogue was particularly fun and seemed to get worse as the movie continued. Most of the characters were Italian Americans or Italian immigrants who lived in New York in the twelfth and thirties, but their dialogue sounded as if they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while mixing cement and bricks. Towards the end I laughed and not because the filmmakers wanted to do that. I think clogged poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have spoken Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they really talk. But, of course, it did not work for me. Another line of dialogue made me laugh for another reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly raises a wonderful British Accent lilting. I just suppose this is related to the fact that the movie was made in England. I give this film an "A" for effort and intent, but with a considerably lower execution.
