After reading some great reviews about this movie, I thought I'd give it a watch and, after I was very disappointed with the movie, I thought I'd give my own review. This is my first date with me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, I would scare the horror of the genre, for it is by no means horrible or scary in the slightest (except for a few weak attempts to make you jump one of whom he worked for me.) I would say that when he sounds this movie, a thriller pushes him, because I was not really excited! The film is about a mischievous evil girl who often fails. In these days, she visits a house she drew, after each visit decides to add something else to the house to become a bit more alive, one of the features being a sad boy who is also sick in reality. As she enriches herself with the boy, she realizes that her imagined world she has created is actually better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her father to the house permanently, because of a deception, her father turns out to be bad, too, and the boy must escape from his claws. Think of trying to be a slightly thinner version of a nightmare on Elm Street, but it's more like a beach trip. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10 will stop at least one of you to look at this!
