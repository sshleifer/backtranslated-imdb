I can not see the attraction of this series (which is supposed to be science fiction). It's just "see what soap happens officially this week" and oh, Cylons are involved in flashbacks. Cylon "babe", which keeps clogging the other guy is pretty blade, it's pretty obvious that T & A was added to the show. Every time it appears, I'm amazed that it happens that the WTF happens. And do not even try to beat the "story springs". It 's a ditch with some CGI thrown in. This is not science fiction besides the original premise. This series is not everything that has been developed. If you like fashionable, doubtful, strenuous, breathtaking, vague camera work this might be for you. Since they just seem to be looking for a show, it is a clear indication that the robber's views have been changed by to Picard's TNG.
