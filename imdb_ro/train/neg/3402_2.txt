That's why the Jane show will not work. Once again, Canadian producers and Canadian writers can not create a sitcom without moving something different. I think these people do not follow very much from T.V. in the US, which has the sitcom below. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the story absolutely absurd and then have a significant B story to try and compensate it. Characters are two dimensions, and story lines are over the top: racing for the forklift ??? give me a break. Here's a little advice for the writers of the show, Do not write funny situations, find funny in situations. And remember, you must be born with a sense of humor to write really fun things, not just to be an improvised monkey.
