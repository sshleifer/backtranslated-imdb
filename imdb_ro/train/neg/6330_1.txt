If you enjoy the original SNL show and then show off this movie at any price. When I first came out of my friends and waited for an hour to enter a movie theater sold. halfway through the film, the theater was 3/4 naked. We refused to let go of thinking that it would improve. When the movie was over, we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all the theaters, then disappeared. In interviews with "Mr. Mike," he refused to comment on this film. The film was a joke about the SNL episodes that came out immediately after the release and shutdown of the films in one day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and mail to get a refund, but were totally ignored.
