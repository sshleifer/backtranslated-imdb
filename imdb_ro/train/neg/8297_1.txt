Ugh! Where to start ... First of all, Campbell Scott's non-stop agitation becomes a real stop after a short period of time, while internalizing his anxiety, curiosity and anger. We just do not care! These characters, presented by the writer and director, are absolutely impossible to accomplish, and the key is in it. They have not given us anything to make us care if they are adulterers and whether or not they are still in love with each other. When Scott silently tells his wife: "I could kill you" before their three daughters at the table, after the shock of her selfish failure disappeared, and I almost wanted him to have - and then did the same thing with the homosexual, Wisecracking appearance of Denis Leary before being towed from the Looney Basket. A total waste of time and probably only resources.
