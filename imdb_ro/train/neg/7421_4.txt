Watching beautiful women sneaking, playing thieves and vardistes is one of the most delighted guilty pleasures the average movie allows me to enjoy. So the House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived, and the script uninspired and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are several hints on Hitchcock's various images, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis as the lead. She's dressed like Grace Kelly, and she's not far from the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way it is presented to the public, it should be someone with political beliefs and a purpose in life. After all the film deals with a well-defined time, real events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates in the first few minutes in a fair story of run-off-the-mill crime with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable because the performers of the actors are good, such as the photo and the design set. <br /> <br /> The finish of Central Station, New York, is breathtaking. Start in the underground section and then move to the roof. The film can be praised for the good use of architecture.
