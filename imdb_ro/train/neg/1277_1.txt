This movie is still stirring me in the thought of bones. This movie was not just bad, just like in the low budget, she acted badly, etc., though certainly It was all these things. The problem with this movie is that it appears to intentionally try to upset the spectator and do it with great success. What I want to know is that it should be a horror film? I mean, it's definitely terrible, but not the way horror films should be. I saw the first segment trying to be horror and failed, but what the heck is the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching an artistic student film, which, amazingly, makes it the least painful segment. It is an atrocity that this movie is not very low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people! I know some people have done good reviews, but, well, they're in a sadistic attempt to get you off. Believe me, it's impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is an amazingly broadening effect of life: it feels like watching this movie for years after just the first half hour.
