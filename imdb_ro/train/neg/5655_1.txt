Egyptian films have a lot of movies with a high level of drama or romance or comedy or even sports action ... "Ziab at Ta'Kohl AL lam" was forbidden in Egypt because it contains nudity Nudity is forbidden in the Egyptian movies .. When I saw the movies I felt down ... The bad story .. Nude actress .. Bad action .. Some horror and colorful colors .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a great movie Egyptian ... Simply: Stay away "Ziab at Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great movies in Egypt ... We have a great actor who won a globe win like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have dire directors like "Yousef Shahin" So believe me. You do not have to see this movie ..
