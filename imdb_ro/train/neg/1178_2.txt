The complete "ridiculous" film is just a thin excuse for his extended, graphic picture of the beast's adventure, a monster that is supposed to appear every century to violate some women. That's what he does, and the movie describes the beast really terrible; is basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a heavy-on that squirts abundant amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal porn, I think it's a real turn-on. I was amused, however, by the opening photos of sex horses in a public market.
