I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was horribly inaccurate. It's like he's got a list of names and he's done it all. His robberies and getaways were well planned, until the second - when the time arrived, they left if they had all the money or not. They had notes of each way, where to go back, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger had paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis did not even see Dillinger before night when Dillinger was killed, only pictures of him. The way the group members died was fictitious. Dillinger has never robbed a single bank, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The act was a little over the top in places. The action has also been overcome. Secondly, I doubt if I had a great deal of joy even if I did not read the book.
