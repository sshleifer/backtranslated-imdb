90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a trick for Bill's boyfriend ... Mindy's prancing at high school dance ... Mindy travels to Big Sur, overturns a piece of "pastoral bread," Mindy gets almost raped. Ah, the pleasures of the Crown International features. You have to remember that these movies have never been designed to be viewed begin to finish on DVD players. They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance, so teenagers in the 1970s would have a soundtrack, as they did in Pintos and Citations. The lack of stimulation and structure did not challenge the original audience - perhaps they were only careful when T & A on screen matched what they had in the parking lot. The film is very irritating when viewed as a story. It's much more fun to talk about it than to follow. My favorite inanits: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights in the motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being kidnapped and almost raped by depressed motorcyclists and after their innocent friend, "Pan", is beaten wild, Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy shines immediately and shouts: "I'm going to Big Sur!" But again, it's much more fun to talk / read than to stay.
