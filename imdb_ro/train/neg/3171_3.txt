Was it the biggest movie I've ever seen? Not. Was it the worst? Not. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it's nice to watch something easy and funny. It was great, but it was nice. I think he certainly had a place to improve, but he tried. I'm not sure if this movie deserves extreme abuse from the other reviewer. Obviously he does not care about Eva Longoria. I think it was better in this than in The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Actors play a huge role in the fact that it's a hit or a flop. Perhaps the distribution did not work. Perhaps too many things have happened. I just wanted to talk about an average movie, not a terrible one. It could be just a chicken shot. As for the Split-Up movie or the French Kiss. My husband is still talking about these. :)
