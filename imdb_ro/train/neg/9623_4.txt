Ben Stiller does not react so much to react. And she does it very well. He's very dependent on the comedy that's going on around him. In "Something About Mary," the hairstyle of the stand-up works only because Stiller is trying to keep a straight face. When faced with the other two suspects of Mary, he is the most unfortunate guy in the room, but the scene is hilarious. In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for difficult to understand reasons. Stiller is surrounded by a series of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which too few. By saying this, Hoffman relies a little too much on body humor - you know we're in trouble when we go to jokes to get a laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman deals with it is totally superimposed (though it throws a difficult situation as a shirtless opponent that raises a smile - obviously through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to act in a balloon, the reaction is very small. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could have played much more, much more. Aniston repeats his role as Rachael again, but Stiller is not Ross. It is rather a "Joey with a passion of Rachael" scenario. Polly is a Rom-com from the phone numbers and fails - he's heartless. You do not have roots for characters. With a little more work we could have a deeper story, but eventually the film's failure is reduced to bad writing. It's worth watching if it appears on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret that you've earned money in cash to see it.
