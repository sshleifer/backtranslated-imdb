I do not know what the other guys see you for Steven Seagal's movies, but I'm following them, because as bad as they are, they're at least always good for laughing. Why would you rate this movie with 1 in 10 based on doubles, when such a thing is exactly what makes a movie like this in a favorite of cult that you can laugh at the disturbance? The force of the attacks is not a great movie at all, but I felt it was a worthy Steven Seagal vehicle, like many other movies; in fact I did not think it was one of the worst with a long shot. It often had a half-coherent partial line and was, in most cases, absolutely interesting. The end was really aspired, but even that had some nice elements to pull. Finally, the story itself did not offer what she promised, but I thought that acting, characterizing (if I used that word so great) and the rest of the production values ​​gave exactly what a true fan of of Steven Seagal. Seagal himself, in particular, was exactly the man he faced with the stone, not the nonsense, which we expected, and the other castrati supported him rather well without putting him on stage. This people is what makes a Steven Seagal movie. Deal with it. Or even better: he laughs at him. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
