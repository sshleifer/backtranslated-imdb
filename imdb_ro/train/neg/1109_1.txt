This is almost certainly the worst western thing I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is customary for western films and martial arts - the hero finds that the family / friends have been killed, so the hero decides to take revenge exactly, expels the inefficient legislator, saves the sweetheart and kills expert arch- nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula was often successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated execution you'll ever see. Scripture is simple atrocities and insulting; it seems that a schioler has written the dialogue because it does not have depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; sometimes seems to be called. Cinema is blades, and sets are sometimes just facades. The act is pathetic; sure, some artists might blame the script, but others can not use this excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a role of speaking again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he only lowers the stamp of his voice and just sounds like a child trying to act macho. And talking about Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, checks his dudes (if you dare to see this movie): He wears these new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hardworking and dirty cowboy. If you enjoy the cinematic inertial fare that only serves to worship Hopalong Cassidy's imagined grandeur, then you get it, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
