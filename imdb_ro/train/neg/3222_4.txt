I was very disappointed in the 1970 film, based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial prejudice, and non-fulfillment of life based on distrust. A black Jewish angel is sent to help the struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) believes only in the angel (Belafonte), Fanny's wife (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically renounced life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel. When she believes her, Fanny improves, but she finally has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a mummy Fanny spoke to Morris. Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her brilliant Academy Award nomination in 1966, "The Shop on Main Street", also directed this film. Kaminska is reduced to film in most bed scenes, and her goodness in her speech does not really convey the desperate situation she faces. She continues to call Ruthie, their daughter, who did not listen to them through marriage in the Jewish religion. For most of the movie, she does not make the appearance of the angel in her apartment. The scene in the pharmacy is confusing, and the scene where Angel's face friend faces Belafonte in their apartment is memorable, but all too short. We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. Those who watch this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and despair.
