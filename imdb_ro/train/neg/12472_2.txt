Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon. Throw away some nice animals, some great games and a pair of roller skates and you will find almost an exact match of this movie. I remember seeing this when I was younger; I made Mama rent it from the video store 5 times. The story itself is not too bad, it's just that any marxists of forgetfulness would certainly have something to complain about. If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
