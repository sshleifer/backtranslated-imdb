A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is a bit more than a 87-minute music film made available to a doxen of the composer's work. Instead of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on Young's verses, which are strongly related to sociopolitical comments, to tell the story while actors act in scenes. Given the performance of the harness and the kindergarten of the image, the effect is the equivalent of Young, who blows some of his own home movies and releases them for public consumption. Although there is supposed to be a "story" going through the film, we have no idea what is happening mainly due to the unwavering aspect of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateur inattitude of the act. All that we receive for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aged hippies that silently cavort through an incoherent narrative, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. Everything turns into a boring exercise of self-indulgence. "Greendale" offers off-Hollywood movie, a low-budget movie that makes a bad name.
