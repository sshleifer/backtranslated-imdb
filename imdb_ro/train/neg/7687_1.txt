I started to watch this big-time movie. However, after an hour I gave up on this movie because it inspired me with many unanswered questions. This has already begun in the opening sequence and has worsened. Why would Hollander bury a statue? Why is an Italian comedian present? Why did Hollander's wife save her husband? Why, after being saved, did he not run for his life instead of starting to make love with the wife of the farmers? Why did the farmer's wife not save Hollander at a time when the farmer would not be around? Why did they understand these allegedly illiterate farmers of Italian illiterate? Why did the Italian comedian find Hollanders Gold? Why did she hide her in the tank in the midst of farmer's property? These and many other questions have arisen and no one seemed to have received an answer in an acceptable way. So, I think I miss the point of view of this movie and do not make any connection with the story.
