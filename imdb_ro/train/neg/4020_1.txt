I will never be a member of any club that would have it, especially on this one. Starr Andreeff is a single mom / striper who is attacked by a female vampire who has left her death. She begins to make a sense of blood and meets John Savage, pointing to wondering where she left Michael Cimino's phone number. Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire family, which consists of a British vampire blonde vamp who attacked Starr and a doll with green hair (do not do that) <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they're trying to kill Savage and Starr and Starr's baby. Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. He spends most of his screen time exposing more facial tics than Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola Bender, and he reads all his lines making a Farrelly Brothers movie. Andreeff tries to do most of a badly written role, but the writer / director Ruben goes for all the vampire rattles, as if Starr eats his son's hamster and you buy a lot of raw meat to fight against the desire for blood. The child is also beaten around, for those who think watching violence against children is really fun. The movie is extraordinarily gorilla, but not in a wilderness on the top road, such as "Killer <br /> <br /> Language." Here, the gore is crude and is never justified, it only appears. It's just in the budget. Most of the R rating refers to Andreeff's colleagues, who are routed through embarrassing tapes in the background of conversational scenes. Budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire ties! All vampires here have to break their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Great idea if you have not already seen Martin Romero. <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes, and once you throw in Ruben's attempts at artistic direction (inclined frames, blurry scenes), this is a tedious, boring and dirty journey. Leave this club and take a shower; <br /> <br /> You will need it. <br /> <br /> It is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sex / violence, strong gore, strong naughtiness, female nudity, sexual references, drug abuse, and adult situations. <br /> <br />
