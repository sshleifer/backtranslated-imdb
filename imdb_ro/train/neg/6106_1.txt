It was terrible that the intrigue was OK, but the rest was bad. I mean they come on the puppet and then they even tried to make the digital film and that made it worse! Normally, I would like the low-budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and it almost made me want to come back to the set that came. I have about fifteen low budget films with about 6-8 movies, and I should say that this is the worst movie of all this. Also, the wording is disabled and uses a fake plastic model that does not even look like a real one, it could use one that looked even closer to a real one, so you save time and money and do not forget horrible movie.
