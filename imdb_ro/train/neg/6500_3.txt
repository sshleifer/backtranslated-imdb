Look, I'm sorry if half of the world is turning away from this, but life is pretty confusing. I do not have to look that way. He dug Anthony Hopkins, the great time. I was just looking at the Fracture and I knew it would be a bunch of Quentin's steaming. But this is not well shot, and it's not bold - even if it's artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for quick cuts and edits, not that excuse "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation." This will hurt your head. It's the fastest ever-moving image and will not take you anywhere. I still love AH and I will always give him another chance, but if you do not have time to watch bad ideas on the screen, skip this.
