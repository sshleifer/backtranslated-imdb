This is actually a bad movie. Ideology is not as perverse as in those films made later by Collins. However, my main doubts about the film are that it's unlikely and quite frankly boring for a long time. The whole concept of an ex-SAS man who unites with terrorists without any particular reason is not very convincing, and you can not ask why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become quite overwhelmed) fall for he. The film starts from a pretty strong scene, but then overturns for a long time building up to the grand finale. On the whole, I think Whoever dares to win could have been an interesting 45-minute episode of Professionals, but the story does not have a feature film. Though reasonably successful at the time, this film triggered the resignation of Collins's career, which in the 1980s made mainly cheap and dubious films of soldiers or army soldiers. Pity, because he is a versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and has a career that is still successful.
