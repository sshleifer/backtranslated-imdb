This is not a movie, it is a 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon drafted by the red state of America, the third high-school football game. Another long and earnest message addressed to the converts, who are then supposedly fired enough to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. The dialogue "You have won the great when you have accepted Christ" loses any possible camp appeal by the worrying intensity of the black eyes, sunk by Alex Kendrick's director / coach. Then there are "parables". Two farmers prayed for the rain, but only one prepared their field to receive it. Who do you think God blessed him? This rhetorical question is meant to point out the miraculous climax during which the coach asks his back-up kicker: "Son, do you think God could help you make that blow?" It is a kind of entertainment we could have expected to receive from infinity, based on faith, if only the hegemonic actions of the evangelical Christian administration around the world convinced us all to become "devoted" to their example . Here's the coach of the poor Giants at the end of the apocalyptic, urging his team to cry "Who's with me!" while the devoted Eagles on the other side have quietly done the work of the Lord. So, do you think our frightened back makes the blow to defeat those self-centered Goliaths? Well, we all know that zealots can not lose. Put it this way: transfer the playing field to the Middle East deserts, replace Christian proselytism, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban-vs-superpower parable, which devoted believers in this trash may want to a minute. Luckily he will not care and do not have to: As the coach tells his team of empty pregnant ships, the answers are all here in this book. And the Christian Right will eat this on their way to their Race, that final victory for which they have prepared their lands.
