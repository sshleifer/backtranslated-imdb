I am a great fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately, the director could not translate the book on the screen. The novel is post-modern and extremely artificial in its exaggerated characters and the disintegration of the traditional line of the park and character development. It is a hilarious examination of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands, the film cries along the speed of shame, indulging in every known shot and the angle of the room "odd" possible. It's like Ken Russel's acid, and suffers from the self-indulgence of the older director, cranked up to a hundred. Even a brief look splendid actor's penis Christian Solimeno was not enough to save this wretched film for me. Abysmal!
