I'll give credit if you want credit and say that Linda Fiorentino offers good performance as an actress who drinks hard, doing what she wants. It's brash, sassy, ​​tough and very sexy; it is much better than this movie deserves. But that's IT. This suspense movie is a messy fragment, trying to be a stalker thriller, a crime thriller, a loyalty and treason story, and an erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not thrilling in the least. For example, who thought about throwing C. Thomas Howell as a leading man? It's not ugly, but to shout aloud, it seems that Fiorentino's goddess is the nicest, with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither authority nor presence on the screen to fill the lead role. The script is by far the most serious aspect of the film. There is no tension, because Fiorentino's character gets strange phone calls, there is no mystery about her guilt in the crimes that are at the center of the movie, there is no sense of liberation, Fiorentino makes Howell lose his inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for interesting but stupid cameo by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and a true sexual scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides, my first impulse would be to put this bad piece down and rent something else.
