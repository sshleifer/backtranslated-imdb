They had such a potential for this film and fell completely. In the first Cruel Intentions, we let ourselves wonder what motivated the lead characters to become as they are and act as they do. There is almost nothing of character development in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story, but this movie did nothing for me. It was as if he had left good writing instead of feminine words. And the end has absolutely no meaning and does not explain anything. The writing was terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used to rent 3 EXACT SAME lines that were original. Like the "boy down" or the kiss scene, and a few that I do not remember. I was not impressed at all by Robin's actor, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that reconciled this movie.
