<br /> <br /> "Abandon the Hollywood veterans?" (the brothers were "called"), that Hollyweird asked and that he received. However, like many of its recent decisions, this was an amazing mistake. The director is SO from touch with today's audience, trying to bring back physical pratfalls and gags instead of funny dialogue is just a disaster. I knew that, the audience knew it, and the CAST knew it. What a shame, why did they always consider changing directors? Not only that, but the two brothers Wayan played as two of the four primary characters without them just a hoax and a sad one. SP <br /> <br />
