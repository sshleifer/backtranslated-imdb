There is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It's pretty harmless, but it's a little more than a miserable movie in the '70s. The film is neither as intelligent nor sexy as she strives to be. The plot is a remake of the tired story of the casino robbery that was made with death. Except for Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery park was designed by a 3-year-old. Does the plan involve three women? one on an unnecessary scale and usually on the outside of the Cicus Circle building, one who should sit as a waitress just to blow his lid on the first occasion and one to sit around to expose his cleavage. That's about that. They're complicated, are not they? Other than Stella Stevens and her breasts mentioned above, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady collaborates with Stuart Whitman. When he does not push Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most stupid gun battles I've ever put on the film. I really wanted to like this movie. She's 70 years old and I feel like I'm always enjoying beautiful photos of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too boring to miss more than a 4/10? and that probably overrated it. Eventually, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of perfectly good cleavage.
