I looked at it hoping to find out something I did not know about the most infamous man in modern history, and I could not realize that history was rewritten in HITLER: RISE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirers. Hitler returned with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but the writers did not confuse Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE? That's pretty bad, but what really bothered me was that this mini-series is missing the whole piece of historical background. Germany lost World War I, and allied powers have made Germany pay a heavy price for it. This was the economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride, and therefore turned to Nazism. The German humility of the 1920s, caused by the allied powers, seems to be completely absent, therefore, there is no way that HITLER: EVOLVE RISK can be taken seriously as a historical document, nor did I mention that Himmler and Goering are conspired by their absence There is only one positive point about the mini series and that Robert Carlyle in the lead role. Well, some of his manners are wrong, and his voice is a bit too strong (the records of the archive show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and manages to communicate Hitler's screen on screen. The British press's comments on the fact that Carlyle looks more like the Sparks player than Adolf Hitler are unfounded and he offers one of Hitler's best interpretations. I liked Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hated everything about this mini series and wondered why it was first. Nothing recommends it to serious fans of history
