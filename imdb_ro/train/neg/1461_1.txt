I saw the movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler he is a man trying to try to be Hitler. The movie stays, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he would not hit people with his fist, but with fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: It's too obvious that Hitler is bad, he was smarter than he was in this movie. No German would have accepted him as a leader, because he can see that it is bad. So the real Hitler did not show the bad side of the people. Have any of you Yankees watched the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? this is a great movie with amazing actors. And a German movie. I think this Nazi-Germany theme should not be made as a film by people who know nothing of Germany. People! Look at "Der Untergang": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ It's a great movie about a very sad time for people around the world.
