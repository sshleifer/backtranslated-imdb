I heard (and I read) so many good things about Weeds that I expected to be tied to another television series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but I was slightly eroded with each episode I looked at of Season One. (not over the first six episodes). The writing was non-original, controversial, and the portrayal of Blacks was embarrassing. Dialogue has been forced, just as writers are trying too much to be intelligent and hip. It was a rare moment when we did a sound of laughter. The characters did not grow enough to care for them, they were selfish and wrong. I absolutely looked at the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been shot on "Getting a Predator"), and the removal of Hodes Quinn's daughter from the distribution by sending her to a boarding school in Mexico was so non-original, I had to conclude that the writers are testing the spectator's loyalty. Episode After Episode I liked the characters less and I could not overcome many of the technical flaws in the story line. <br /> <br /> Add to the fact that I heard that Season Two was not as good, so I lost all the motivation to continue watching this game out. If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you, unless you are of course stoned and then all bets are off.
