I did not think this movie deserves a bad scripture, a bad act, except Janine Turner, a fantasy, a stupid plot, a bad husband and an unfair divorce set. If you have never seen this movie before not bothering it is not even worth it at all. The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even murdered criminals. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just crazy. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Pretty girl, no. Yes, it's a real peach, no. No day at the beach.
