6/10 Action, not great, but a little better. 4/10 Director, makes stupid decisions for this movie. 2/10 Writer, the story does not make sense at all and has a large amount of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall rating for this movie. Do not waste time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it could be too much. Characters are so exaggerated that they can ever be in real life, and some pretty unexplained stuff happens "in the story," not in a good way. Because of the style in which this movie was shot, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera movements and fast forward). It's always good that the movie uses music to make the story go smooth, but there are too many tracks in it. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
