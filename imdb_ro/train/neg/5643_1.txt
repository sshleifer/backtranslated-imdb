I have two home entertainment stores and I've seen many bad movies in my time, but it was so bad that it forced me to register here and comment. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for his performance in Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande's film in this film. He was robotic and uninspired. Her baby just died a month before she arrived at the Rubber House she had given her. Once there, she discovers that she has cheated her in her whole relationship, but none seem to register with her. One day, she begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe), the housekeeper. Even though she is married to Dafoe on the screen, her scenes with him were cold and unemotional. If it was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe has managed to save this movie from an amateur, cinematic wreck.
