A horror of tiny and low (haha!) 80, such as there, is thirteen to a dozen, but it can be considered funny if you follow it in the right mood. The special effects are sticky, acting atrocious, and the script seems to lack some essential paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typically quiet and American city, where each teenager is working on the same dinner, and where the high school kid dampens cherry bombs in the toilet. Here, a television guru called Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for mind control nationwide. Under the label of "Independent Thinkers," a giant shell scoop sends waves through TVs and forcing innocent viewers to kill! How hard is this? Now, it depends on teen-rebel Meadowvale to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake comes from and his monstrous brain. There are obvious references to alien life, but that means. Meh, who needs the background in a movie like that, really? There is not a lot of shedding of blood unfortunately, and the "bad" brain looks like a big sock puppet. The only thing more or less interesting for horror lovers is to take a look at the distribution and crew that made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same people who made "The Day of Blood" (the pleasure of mine) and "Ciuma". Both are much better movies and have decided wisely to step down from the cinema industry. The most famous person in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in the Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak offers the nudity factor and she is obviously a great talent? She has exactly three films on her repertoire that she's "masterpiece" of. In her debut, she was credited as a "fugitive model," and in "3 men and a child," her character is called "one of Jack's girls." I really wonder how she feels her career as an actress?
