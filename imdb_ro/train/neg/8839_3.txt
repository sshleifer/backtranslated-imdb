A young attempt and good ideas (the prostitute's redeeming, human beings helping each other, ...) but a poor result ... The director has obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung recreating an ambience should portray Viet Nam ... The only problem is that Vietnam has gone a long way and when the "Green Papaya Parfume" had a historical past ... trying to design such an ambience (biting sounds and a slow rhythm of life. ..) in modern day leaves a feeling of fake. Besides, it quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. I can assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because there Harvey Keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war ... But in South Vietnam nobody or very few people speak with the Nordic focus clip displayed by actors ... Really strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. an old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease for people in his state), a peasant girl who can read and write Vietnamese poetry, ... even more dubious ... <br /> <br />
