I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore blows of all kinds. Some of my favorites are really "good" horror movies. But this movie has nothing to guarantee it's viewing! I will not spend much time talking about everything that is wrong with her. The scenario is horrible. The act is horrible. FX does not even deserve to talk. The set is an absolute JOKE! The sad thing is that I think there could be real potential in some actors, but this vehicle has left them nothing to work with! Suffice it to say that I saw him for "free" and feel like I was robbed! The time you waste, you'd better spend your cat.
