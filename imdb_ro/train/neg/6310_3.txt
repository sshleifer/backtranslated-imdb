I watched this movie last night and I was a little disappointed. A lot of "time deeds" have been stopped. At the beginning of the movie, Grandpa made a comment on this nephew and his friends about how they felt when he hit 9-11. This film was supposed to take place in 1994. Also, one of his nephew's friends wore an Eagles T-shirt Donovan McNabb. He had not even been ready yet. The story line was good, but the facts and the timeliness of the time were so far from the bottom that they made the film look like cheese. My friend is a passionate reader of books and memorabilia from the Second World War. I hired this movie in the hope that it would be good. The actor was like that. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was made made me glad I paid only $ 4 to rent it, unlike the 50, which I should have seen at a theater. I hope that whoever reads this thing understands that I am not talking about any dissatisfaction with those who fought the war, but the facts and the time should have been monitored a bit more carefully.
