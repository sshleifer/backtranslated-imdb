Repetitive music, annoying narrative, terrible cinema effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around the shock and the other half seemed to be focused on relaxing the type of crowd that would force people to start a fight. One of the best scenes was in the "deleted scenes", the one she is in the principle office with her mother. I do not understand why they cut that. The film seemed desperate to do something about what it might be and Domino talking about sororities would have been a climax of the movie. The high camera work is a reminiscence of MTV and is not absolutely necessary or useful for a movie. Accelerate the movie just to jump over a lot of things and rotate the camera around something repeatedly old the first time it was used. It's like directors want to use all these extra pictures they did not want to cast. Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should have told me not to follow her out of the preview. A popular movie for the crowd "in".
