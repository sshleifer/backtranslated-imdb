In a recent biography of Alec Guinness we could not find much about Paris with love. I'm sure Guinness made the movie to get a free trip to Paris from her. The film has no other reason to live. Of course, Paris is beautifully photographed with the wonderful opening of Guinness and his son descending on the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes beyond that. There is no chemistry between Guinness and the young man with whom he has a short walk in Paris. According to Guinness's recent biography by Piers Paul Read, Guinness does not like the girl, she found her unprofessional behavior. As for what Odile Vernois was thinking about the co-star, there is no record. They have as much chemistry as two cats with castration. Guinness has a good time in the movie that was directly from an Ealing comedy as he climbs a tree in an attempt to recover a badminton shuttle. But we did not expect the movie for that. At least Alec made a trip to Paris from the deal.
