As far as I can say is a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I have to say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrific actress and is not convincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is very thin, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie to your dangers David Tang of Shanghai Tang should be after the film for his little or no income that this film will generate. The banal park is trying to compete with other rom-coms there, and only mixes in the landscape. It was like watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
