Did he see on 12/24/2009 ?? April 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): fluffy Christmas emotionally not have enough specificity to explain how it happened real story in this incident based on the facts of a man who was put in prison wrong attempt to get a job for the family to make Christmas happen for them. The three children in the family then ran home on a trip to Washington D.C., to beat US President Herbert Hoover. This trek offers some stories such as their positive meetings with a hobo and a puppet, which makes the story to be something like a Disney movie "animals on the way" and does not fit perfectly here. At the end, there is no detail about how the president helped the family and this is another point of view of the film, in my opinion. The film brings tears, but it takes too long to get to it. The film would not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but has obvious failures that make it look like? so I'm not sure their information is correct. Overall, this is a simple movie (which would have been more complex), a happy Christmas story, but played gently and without much substance.
