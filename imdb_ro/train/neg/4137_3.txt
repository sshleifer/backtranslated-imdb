I have a high level of tolerance for nonsense, so I was looking forward to this. He did not disappoint. It seems to be based on classic Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu, after which a father and daughter hunt a vampire who fortunately happens to travel with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or general, as he likes to be called here) running over random zombies. Did I say it was a zombie outbreak? The dead come back to life, but no one seems too worried. We have building zombies, zombie soldiers and even school zombies at St.Trinian. It looks like Santa Claus is looking for her daughter who has been transformed into a vampire. Oh, they're waiting for vampires, the little girl is in a crazy asylum and Carmilla is her assistant, or is she? Zombies are back and Santa is crazy. Lesbian sex, I love vampires and I love zombies, but I prefer lesbian sex. Nothing like simulated cunnilingus to get the juices that flow. When do we see the vampires fight against the zombies? Is he a vampire or is he crazy? Or both? Carmilla is a female lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here the St.Trinian zombies come. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex, then zombies kill and eat vampires. Do I think zombies have won or not? Plot? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and school zombies? And cunnilingus?
