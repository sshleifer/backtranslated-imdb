I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before going to work. If you have any interest in seeing Dean Cain's dives and avoiding being fired at least a dozen times, this film is for you. If you do not touch your interest, I'm afraid you will want to be wrapped in flames , because this movie is pretty bad. The actor, first of all, is terrible, awful, terrible. Characters are totally inappropriate, and dialogue is worse than your typical Z, Sci-Fi movie. Towards the end, the movie began to remind me of "The Hollow Man" (complete with escape through the elevator), except for a Dragon, not a naked and invisible man. Unlike other similar movements, however, this was not even bad ... it was simply bad.
