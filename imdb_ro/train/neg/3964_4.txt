For all the hype about this movie, I kept an open mind in what I was thinking about in the end. And sometimes, sometimes slow, the first 90% of the film is pretty good, with more than a few "old times," scary, half-anxiety. I really thought the cinema was excellent in many of these scenes. If Dark Remains fails, however, it is in the climax. The end of the film and the name are what MILES APART seems to be in his body. The story falls completely on the face with an illogical conclusion, and the answer we look for most - what happened to Emma? - Not elucidated! The reason for the negative energy was at best ridiculous and, finally, I felt very cheated. What could be a terrible horror movie was finally haunted by a terrible ending.
