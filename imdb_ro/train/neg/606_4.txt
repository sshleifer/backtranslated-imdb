The potential was there. I saw Creep and I thought, "Oooh, that becomes interesting" several times. However, exciting plot lines exploded or were ignored, as they have never happened. The main character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point, both of us and I shouted that I wanted to die. There are really frightening / scary moments, but they are largely shaded by the moments that have just bothered the hell. It is another of those horror movies that you cultivate and intrigue for a while, but ultimately leave you frustrated and a little confused about what filmmakers are trying to accomplish. the movie is the bad guy, but when Baddie is more enjoyable than the main character, you know you're a loser.
