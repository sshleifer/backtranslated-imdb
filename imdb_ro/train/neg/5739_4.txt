A small town is attacked by a hordes of vampires thirsty in blood. The only hope is a lonely avenger and a group of broken survivors. Released in 1993, "Darkness" obtained something from a cult after the release. It's easy to see why - it's loaded with gore, and it's about energy and excitement, like those found in other horror films such as The Dead Next Door and The Children of Ravensback "is actually quite infectious. While this may be true, unfortunately it is not enough to save it. The film was shot on a Super 8, so the image is granular and dark, making things very hard to see (it would have been great if the horrible shepherd protagonists were hidden). Also, the grille is the soundtrack, made up of Casio annoying Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what about these horror movies and Death Metal?) While not expecting Oscar-like performances, the act is another hour of amateur amateur, because the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened. Finally, I'm sure our fans gorefests do not want to love this. All others, however, will want to have a little more meat on their ribs.
