I admit that most of this movie was uninspired, but I was still distracted. She has a wonderful feeling of frenetic energy, above-average music, and women in the movie naturally defend themselves, there are no prisons here. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this has had an interesting intrigue along with some social commentary. They allude to the way the army deals with viral epidemics, destroying everything on sight, even if it means the people that should be saved. Also, how dangerous martial law is, because democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to try to combine his previous work (zombie, beyond the gates of hell) in an effort to improve somewhat on them. He failed, but certainly not miserable, as a number of people would have thought of you. for zombie movies, so I admit they are somewhat biased when it comes to revising them. All I'm saying is that this movie is good for once, if it was not so much downsizing in making this film (the quit quit and bruno (I can handle the best of them) the mum took over) could have been much better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as a part of the zombie morning swans. A surprising note is that there is no scene in the zombie 3 that the cemetery man actually stole, I could not believe it myself, check it out, you'll be surprised.
