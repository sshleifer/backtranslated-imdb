This movie was bad to laugh. A friend rented from Netflix and made me look at him. There are so many busts and goats that it's impossible to bother even knowing the characters and the plot. What about these, for example ... "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's miraculous shirt appears during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> The palatal priest priest ... complete with a folding table desk <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look at technical defects, you'll find horrible adventure and casting. I was very muddled by casting a flamboyant homosexual actor to play the right religious zealot brother. His opening scene, set in his immaculate apartment, petting cat cats, was hilarious. Applauds the writer / director / producer / publisher / dentist star / distributor / dentist (and anything else he has done) to get a featured movie. If you have nothing better to do, it could be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game, but do not rent it for a storyline about homophobia and homosexual marriage.
