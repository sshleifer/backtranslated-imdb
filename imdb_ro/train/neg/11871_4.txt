Gregory Peck's actor was great, as we would have expected, and the cinema quite amazing even when we play directly in a melodramatic melodramatic moment. But the rest of the movie was overcrowded and hard to follow for me anyway. I tried to like it, but I had to move forward fast in the last thirty minutes. I feel we've lost some good hours. If it had not been for Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted for fifteen minutes. 4/10.
