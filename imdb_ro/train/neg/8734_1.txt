Maybe we saw a murder too much, or maybe they're not taking the right medicines. It was the weirdest seeker, the poor plot, the absurd plot, the simple bad movie seen in a long time. As for the direction, it seems that it took less time to show this than it did to put together. In fact, it seems like to do it directly to the video before it is completed. It's a bad "M" reversal, the classic Fritz Lang movie with Peter Lorre. You'd better hire that instead.
