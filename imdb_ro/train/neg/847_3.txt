The film is about two brothers who should be the same - but they do not expect to be intelligent - one is a surgeon and the others can write a computer code. The geniuses, as they like to call themselves, are very exaggerated sounds, if you compare them with the personal features you can perceive from the title material. Frankly, I did not like the movie style. I think the anxiety, confusion and deep blouses that they bring are there for a purpose, but what I do not understand is why there is so much. The movie is inexpensive on the scenes and tells the story, practically without any human aspect in it. Provides the comic book as experience. However, the viewer's visual counting brings some blues, with short dialogues, monotone scenes, dynamic cuts, music and steep noises. The story of the movie is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically imagined for long minutes, mostly in the delusion confrontation simulation of drug effects and dynamic cuts. I will openly say that this film has not met my expetations a bit small.
