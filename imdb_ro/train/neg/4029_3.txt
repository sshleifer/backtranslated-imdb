The story idea behind "LOST MISSILE" is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story gets a bit bored to the middle, and the excess film material as well as the weak special effects sink this movie to sub-par. /> <br /> The film starts with a rocket headed to Earth. In a panic because it is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This is not necessarily good, however, because this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor track that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit above the planet. In other words, with every passage he makes, a trace of death follows - one that could kill us all! So, it is the duty of US scientists (led by a very young and hard-to-recognize Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us - and especially to save New York, which is on its way immediate! Unfortunately, they fail to save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I can not tell if it's a big loss or not), but due to the good old American know-how, they can eventually destroy this publisher destruction! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the story idea is not bad and rather original. But, so many old combat videos and radar crews aging and looking like stitches. On the whole, a decent, insufficiently inspired film that extreme fans of the genre can want - everyone else, can see it at your own risk.
