This movie is an idiot attempt to some sort of action thriller. A tour bus on its way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white burglars who carry dug buggies. They take them to the wilderness and then steal all of their valuables. The land is constantly changing. One minute tries to kidnap a rich farmer's daughter, the next one looking for a $ 90,000 collection stamp. Dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie.
