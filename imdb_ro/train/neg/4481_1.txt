I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque's ads, but I thought I would give him a chance. So I saw it and all I can say is that it is not. This movie was so bad. It's rare to hate a movie so much. Watching this movie reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player" when writers put their bizarre ideas on the producers. I would like to know which MTV producer has decided that a Bronte video adaptation of an hour and a half of music (but this time Heathcliff is Heath and he is a rock star and Hindley is Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> <br /> Even so, it may not have been so bad if it had not done any other aspect of the horror movie so horribly wrong. The direction must have been "that you are loneliness for me." I laughed aloud during all the "serious" scenes and I got bored in the rest. The camera work has been scratched and they have repeatedly reminded me that I was looking at a bad movie, trying to be nervous. My theory is that the sound type got bored and went down to the beach for some beers with its boom - all I heard in the half-scene was the waves. And in the other scenes, I want to hear everything I can. And talking about the sound, what they did to the song "More" from the Sisters of Mercy is absolutely inexplicable, and again, it is incontrovertible what they did to Bronte. On the bright side, it was a fun scene - especially when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you can tell me what this scene had to do with the rest of the story, more power for you.
