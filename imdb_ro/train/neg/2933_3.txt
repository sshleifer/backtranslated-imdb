If you read the book - do not put your big hopes, if you did not, read it and never watch the movie. It is strange to hear that Toby Young was actually heavily involved in writing the script (as he claims in post-script book). Because the movie is very different from the book. What seems to consider film - making a piece challenging and fun rather thought that combines philosophical ideas simple and funny sarcasm, simplifying it so that everyone can understand - is done with perfection. The film is filled with inappropriate and cheap jokes for a sitcom and lost any significant message it might have. You better not see him.
