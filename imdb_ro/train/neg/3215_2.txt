The film has a nude scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed with the exposed genitals in the middle of the screen. It's a fairly long scene. What was the point? I almost think it should have been fun, but we watched it with my mother, and it was not funny to look for what seemed like a minute. The film is cold. None of the characters is really nice. Audrey Tatou is nice, of course, but her character is an unfortunate girl. I really would not recommend this movie. I expected him to be charming and fresh, but he was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a very high crust, educated a French family and looked down on these characters. <br /> <br />
