Along with 2 days in the Valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just another long line of Tarantino ripples that have appeared since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere that the film creates is amusing for the first five minutes, but then filmmakers make the mistake of unforgiveness to allow unnecessary and grotesque violence to increase the hip coefficient. It would be better to skip this.
