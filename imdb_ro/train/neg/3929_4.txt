If all this will be offered by Watchowski as to a story back to the Matrix, I have to question the claims of all the fans who think the films are meant to record at a deeper level. The second rebirth, while stunning and visually beautiful, is composed of stories and ridiculous. How many times have I heard the story of people relying too much on technology, people too eager to make war, people being destroyed practically? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second rebirth, does not the cars be good boys ?! Cars are oppressed by generations by their cruel human administrators. They struggle back, gain their freedom, and try to establish a peaceful peaceful coexistence with the people, who reject them in favor of a total war that smarter cars earn naturally. If this is the back story, then we should not be rooted for Neo, we should be rooted for cars! People were cruel and oppressive, while the cars were courageous and appealing to be compassionate. Since I do not think Watchowski intends to favor cars on humans, I must think that the second Renaissance was simply a wrong trial @ creating a story.
