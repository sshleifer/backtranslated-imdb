I just bought VHS on this movie for two dollars, I scattered my money! I dug Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan Island" Louise, but hello! This third-rate production is a revival of another dozen biker movies; a strange group of motorcyclists who travel to a hick city, beat everyone and everyone and then are defeated in the man by a bold hero. Adam West looks like a hero but misses Batman's head and uniform. Sorry, it's just not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and scared the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" once it was saved from the island ... LOL! Motorcyclists are a motley group, and the ones they know have ever acted again or at least should not. The hell's hell is the hell to be watched!
