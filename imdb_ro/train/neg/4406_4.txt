This French-inspired action / sci-fi hybrid shows David Warbeck as Miami reporter, who is chosen by the ghosts of the Atlantis people (!) To stop a bad businessman (nominated for the John Irish Academy Award) to use a fetus telepathically grown using spores from an asteroid to lead the world. Do you have all this? In spite of such a collapsible plot, this is actually quite lost, and ATLANTIS RAIDERS laugh in contempt. Frankly, the most intense creative thing about this move is the easy resumption of the theme of COP BEVERLY HILLS by Herbie Hancock for opening titles. The most unintentional creation involves a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably displayed twice in the back. Maybe director Alberto De Martino wanted to bring us all the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I wanted to declare the worst film in Ireland about his resume, but then I saw SATAN's CHEERLEADERS out there. I would also like to say for sure that I am probably the only person in the history of the world who makes a dual feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
