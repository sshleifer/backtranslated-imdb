I hired this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ..... However, the first problem was that it really was not a story ... or actually there was a story but it did not make any sense. The second problem was that these characters were not set up ... yes, we all went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you realized they had nothing in common and did not like it. .. why they continued to meet together. Failure number 3 ... the director, although long pauses and strict camera photographs were equal to suspense (especially with typical suspense music). He was unfortunately wrong. It was painful to see a terrible actress like Amber Benson's waste time trying to bring her back to life ... my only hope is that the money he made here was made to produce his own film.
