When I was a child in the 1970s, a local theater had Matinees for children every Saturday and afternoon of Sunday (someone remembers them?). They showed this one year around Christmas time. Me and some friends, I went to see him. I just waited for a cool Santa Claus movie. What I received was a terrible movie and really creepy. Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (do not ask me what the two do in the same movie) Satan (a joker in a stupid devil suit full of horns!). The images had made me gather in my chair. I've always found Santa Crazy to start, because that's not going to help. The guy in the Satan costume did not help. But what really terrified me were the wooden donkeys that drew Santa's sleigh. When they hurt and sounds creepy - I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later I still remember that I looked at that theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were scared about her. I just saw an ad on TV and ALL those nightmares came back. This is a frightening, disturbing Christmas movie that will probably scare your trousers from any small child who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This becomes 1.
