Trying to earn money in the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 versus 100 comes this entertainment blade - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy shimmy dancers out in bright red hen clothes. A competitor receives the beginning of a phrase such as "Which team lost ...". with three options, A, B or C, each one completing the phrase. The contestant has three chances to provide a response to one of these three choices. Host - William Shatner, to his inappropriate smarmies - asks the competitor if he wants to "block the answer," and when the competitor says yes, choose a "dancer" who calls him "Show me the money!" It opens a breakdown that has a sum, and if its answer was correct, it adds that amount to its earnings; if wrong, the amount is low. (So ​​theoretically, it is possible for a competitor on this shadowy disaster to cope with Shatner's money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the competitor chooses the girl who has that scrolling but answered right, nothing happens. If he mistakenly replies, the game enters the Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he does that wrong one, he leaves nothing. Before going to commercials, Shatner screams, "let's dance," and Shatner, the competitor and the 12 dancers shake the prey. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "a last dance," and they all get more agitated. I gave this show to 6 episodes at most, hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could have been worse - he could have bribed Cuba Gooding Jr as a host, though I bet he's a better dancer than "Shat," as I call it these days.) <br /> 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It only lasted 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
