In accordance with Disney's well-known practice of stealing .. I mean .. by buying known properties and bastarding them, this live-action version of the venerable classic cartoon has come to be one of the worst re- a year of bad re-marks. I grew up on the original cartoon series. Any episode in the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than this whole movie. Penny's calculation book is not present. Also, there is no gag with the self-destruction orders that always end up blowing the boss. The new is a smooth conversation gadget (the original design had a cooler car that could turn into a truck or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic story from Hollywood. Do not fill the coffers to pay Disney executives and even their ex-executives - you do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
