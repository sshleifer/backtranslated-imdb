Let's be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this is an exciting movie. Like something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a very poor product. If I safely change the channels and I happened to catch this movie accidentally, I would probably stop my eye and my attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would get a suitable cinematic product, that is, a movie, I feel deeply disappointed. It's a piece of video, something over the sixty-year series, but without that charm. Besides the principal leader, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either the chaps in the campus (too old for that), or members of the director's household who appear in front of the room without not only the working sofas but also the make-up artist the hairdresser (a hood above the bent permanent bangs or a hat above the mullet is a very long way since the 1840s). Everything is shot using a still room mounted in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. The synthesizer generated an uninspired score of the romantic karaoke "period" blade insulting viewers' ears on more than one occasion. The movie is trying to be "dreamed," while in fact it's just a collage without content of those photos that made it editable (and believe me, the standards were not too big to get started). There are interesting dialogues from time to time, but in general it is a pretty tortuous and two-dimensional production in many ways, without any glimpse of genius from the director or any crew member. That's how "artistic" movies were attempted in the 1980s. Mister. Redfield does a much better job than an actor than the director.
