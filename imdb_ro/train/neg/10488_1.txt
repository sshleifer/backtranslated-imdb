Elvis left the building and is lucky, because he did not have to look at this disgusting disaster. The scene after stage director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an even less funny non-functional scenario. Filled with unpleasant death, with homosexual characters and jokes, this film is more desperate than funny. This is a kind of movie that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Day in early retirement. Let's remember how she was (talented) and not what she became. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all lost talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize talent at every step. The guy who plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King. The only good thing about casting is the young man who plays Basinger as a clerk. It really looks like she is actually pretty good. The only reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks's cameo. The cameo is not so funny, but at least it's not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has Hanks' incriminating photographs or something that would make him make this film.
