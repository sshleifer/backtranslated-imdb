This film refers to British prisoners of war in the Second World War who escaped from a camp in Germany. I find my "Wood Horse" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspense, and adrenaline fueled, but the "Wood Horse" is said in a very simple way. It's a collection of simple and inappropriate events without suspense and excitement. The first half clearly explains how prisoners of war have dug a tunnel, but the events are so clear that there are not enough bullets and shaves to make the edge. The second half of the movie is even worse, moving from one place to another without being watched by cats and mice. And the characters could talk a little less and have more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed with "The Wood Horse," lost the potential of being a great movie.
