Lesbian vampire movie about a couple on vacation that is based on what they think is an empty manor, but is really used as a pair of lesbian vampires. Just as vampires bring casual victims the couple goes about their business until the two groups collapse together. Very nice movie with two very sexy women like vampires is nothing beyond the eye candy that they offer to recommend this cult movie. Yeah, a sexy vampire story. It's not at all interesting beyond women. To be honest, there's a reason I've seen pictures of this movie in horror books and in magazines, it looks very good but different than that ... <br /> <br /> For those who want to see only vampires sexy.
