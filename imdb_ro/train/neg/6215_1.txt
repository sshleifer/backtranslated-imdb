It was really a waste of time ... the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very suddenly with many gaps ... though the animation is top. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, telling me that it might become interesting at the later stage, but it was never unique. The same plot was always played, but what made it worse was that the big hole in the plot was the whole story about how to kill the wicked ... The writer could have done much more with the whole concept, that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. Overall, too much hype, but not able to deliver.
