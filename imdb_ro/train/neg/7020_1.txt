Watching Smother was probably the longest 90 minutes of my life. It was not a laugh to be had; in fact, I do not ever remember a smile. Diane Keaton was unhappy as a middle-aged pair of young dogs, a career writer with a motherly character, an irritating woman who obviously suffers from a personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, worst of all, boring. I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long line of film clips - a rupture, a socially distant relative who only tries to enter the "Industry," the tough and long-suffering, but very pleasant, gentle wife, but the latter moves beyond discord and resembles at home), the flock of unruly dogs who want to chew pillows while everyone is away, etc. God, snoring. I was never a fan Diane Keaton and Smother reminded me of why. Overacting exceeds no matter how many pictures you've taken in the foreground. Her attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What was the director thinking about me? While I like Dax Shepard and sometimes even tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so steady and boring that it was clear that no actor did not fuck about this movie. It was all right, because John Keaton's intolerability had not even been self-inflicted, and sometimes Shepard's contempt for her seemed authentic. By the end of the movie, I wanted to pour myself.
