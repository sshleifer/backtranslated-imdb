Personally I would advise people to stay clear of this movie. There is a cellar as a whole and fights are badly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary. But, anyway, ever since there was a movie Ninja worth watching. I can not think of one and I really do not want it. Generally, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: Avoid any movies that contain the word "Ninja".
