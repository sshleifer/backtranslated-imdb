I'm sorry, but it's terrible. I told people about this movie and about some of the bad acts that are in it and almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern Japanese troops retreat in the days of the Busido warriors and their modern weapons fit almost for everything. When the troop realizes for the first time that something strange happens, every person behind the shipment has to say, "Hey my watch stopped"? Imagine that lines like this are repeated 15 times before saying something else and you lack the greatness of the film in a nutshell.
