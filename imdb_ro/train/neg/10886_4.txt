I just looked at the Convent for the second time. I enjoyed it earlier and I realized it would be for a drunk movie on Friday night drunk, a gore, a style, a little humor and the like. I was saddened to find out that I can not appreciate much. It seemed like somebody wanted to return to cheeseball episodes, such as Demon Night, for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worth it. For recording, I'm not even a big fan of the Demons Night, but there were a few things I actually dug up. The monastery makes cheese, but not so much goodness. In addition to the main girl (performance enjoyed by Joanna Canton), the Gothic girl and a sweet camee from Adrienne Barbeau, almost all the characters were discontentedly careless, sneaking at the lowest inferior levels of moronic and offensive jockhood. The film is then hampered by the total lack of free nudity, which means that, given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and to get a harder understanding of the good points of the film. The malefics are original in design and have a lot of good scenes, although they are not frightening, certainly quite cold, and the film also has plenty of gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on stage, the movie becomes quite fun, because all the unpleasant people are dead and a foolish nun who is frenetic. Also, the stylized direction has good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. Generally, it was a film in which, for me, good bright spots simply can not compensate for the things that I hate. The most passionate of this type of film could enjoy it much more, but for me it was not a good time.
