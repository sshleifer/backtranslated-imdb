As one of the few commentators who did not see the first film, I thought it was a very disappointing film. Yes, he has a strange funny guy if you can stand (very) morally dubious. However, he fails very importantly in important areas. There is a thin and meaningless line that involves Gordon Sinclair's generous friend, who may or may not be in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronic products to third world countries - to free computers ... or, eventually, not. Vague, long and inconclusive. The lack of any substantial end is so infuriated, and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film feels half finished. Suspension of distrust is extremely difficult when a testimony of a female professor (Maria Doyle Kennedy) is very attractive, may be attracted to Gordon Sinclair's unimpressive character, especially when moving towards his progress. Ridiculous. It worsens later in the movie when it touches its romantic ambitions, then throws it all for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. Not many movies let me feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
