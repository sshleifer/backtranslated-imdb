- = Contains spoiler from both original and cinematic versions = - <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of Notre Dame Paris music, I read the book this summer and I saw the movie today, at first I was full of hope to watch a good movie, especially when I saw the 6.3 IMDb point. the first scenes were good, but I actually expected the scene of the theaters straight from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kissed gringoire, I felt something wrong. kissing in the book, even in music .. and there was a huge gap in why Esmeralda being judged by a wizard, in the book she teaches her goat how to answer clock numbers or write the word "Phoebe" .. to wait for a phoeb they did not was there? in this film he is a garbage soldier nothing more, the creators made love Quasimodo to show around and even canceled Frollo's love .. but Notre Dame was frollo. his thoughts the struggles between love of God and love of man in the movie we can not find such a thing, all we have is a villain who is really evil and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts ... and he does not mention phoebus , frollo, not mentioning jehan (frollo's brother) who does not mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's OK, the story would have cut a lot) did not even mention the true story. (another PS: frollo was not an opus dei or some member worship he actually in the interest of alchemy he is trying to make gold .. he was stuck in science and religion) finally do not look at this movie, it is sort of edition directors to the real masterpiece, and if you saw it before reading the book, the god has mercy on you .. you have to read to book immediately .. this movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II animated movie while watching Notre Dame Paris music .. pretty to say ..
