You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not particularly want, a man who creates budget hatred after budget horror for less enthusiastic receptions. But he continues to do everything. Even half-hearted praise than surrounds Camp Blood's films is given patience and is as guilty as anyone. Normally, Brad manages to throw something interesting in the mix, a clean idea, a brave character, whatever it is, but without funds to take it more than the base level, he relies on the audience to keep quiet and to appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty offers a lively and fun-filled show like Ebenezer Jackson and a credit given to Sykes that he can feel that this round of play will work within the movie. Come to a multiplex next to you in a parallel universe somewhere.
