For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the movie based on the whirl of our eyes until the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "Wedding Date", I can only record the movie with 4 out of 10 possible tears. My apologies for the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between them two characters. The premise of the film is a Pretty Woman reversal, and Dermot plays Nick, a high quality male escort engaged by the character of Debra Kat who accompanies her in England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship probably develops between the patron and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there was not enough romantic spark to fly in the relationship between Nick and Kat. In a supportive role, Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came to the screen, she served as a spark plug and a catalyst for film energy. Perhaps, if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat, the movie could have had more dynamism. But, as it turned out, instead of going to Kleenex, I was looking for Visine to try to pretend at least that this film had a true feeling and romance.
