This week, I thought it would be fun to recover Corey Haim, just when I saw the last two Lost Boys movies last week and everything. Not that I'm a boy fan - not by far - but I liked those two Coreys in some of my early teenage movies. So I got ready for three movies with him. Unfortunately, I chose "Dream Machine" as a premium (I have not seen it before) and it was so horrible, I decided to block Corey back into my closet and let him wake up Again, before you go into something else. But I managed to fight first through this movie. I had the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986) but was caught in his own illusions. Basically, the whole movie wants to be a comedy, and it almost tries to hopelessly be a thriller. The only good thing about the "Dream Machine" is the premise: A dead body in the trunk of a Porsche. Everyone else fails that bad, it's embarrassing. Even for Haim. They can satiate him as his young man, excited by himself, but at least when he comes with some directorial rules. This was not evident in the "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend's clothes? Just a blonde who has no lines in the movie. Perfect crime ... almost? A guy crashing down his ass like the bastard of the movie, trying the entire movie to steal his body back out of the trunk, never really succeeds, and then at the end of the film he thinks it's Michael Myers (minus William White Shatner mask) and mistakes Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think he could have made a hit if he tried. A stupid, unhappy movie with a story that leads nowhere to the direction of a director who does not know how to direct the cast. A great achievement! A final question for Mr. Haim: Who was the idea was you to smile directly in the room in the last photo of the movie? Yours or the director? So it's not over.
