When I started looking at this movie, I saw the typical Buffy, Xander and I realized how beautiful it is that she still makes a life in movies. Now, a strange movie can stand because it is a good dose of weird, for example David Lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highways, etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. But this has made me strangely remember the crazy websites about there about the conspiracy theory that does not really make any sense. I mean, it comes to the Nazi people who conspire with America to make an endless trinity of evil powers? I was surprised that they did not mention the empty ground in this film with Hitler's flying saucers and lizards. Perhaps if you had 60 grams of heroin with this film, it would be something like that, but seriously do not condemn drugs as if I do not accept this film. It should be burned, cut and looked just so good, that Xander could get another job. It was not his act, that was good, but the script had no meaning. Sorry.
