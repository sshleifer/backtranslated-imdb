It's not one of Keaton's best efforts, maybe it was an attempt to take revenge on the family he married - Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences make Buster marry a great Irish woman who (along with her father and brothers) treats him shamefully until he thinks he can be the heir of a fortune. The wrong identities abound here - gags are set up and because the main ones fail to pay. The short subway has at least two real laughs - Buster turns smart around the lack of dinner using the wall calendar and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to the plate. The other one is a family photo, with the whole group collapsing slowly on the floor as the camera tripod loses its stability. Overflow of yeast beer could have been the catalyst of a massive series of gags built on gags, but it stops short (for all accumulation) of development. The cinema print is crisp and clear and the score is one for the piano player, drums and sound effects. It's not one of Buster's best efforts, but it's worth a few laughs.
