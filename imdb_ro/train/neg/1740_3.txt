The film was a great disappointment. Especially because it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such subtle standards. Short (almost nonexistent) scenario and bad melody sequences every minute and in strange moments have killed any humor the movie can offer. some of the scenes were funny, but probably rose to only 5 minutes throughout. Editing was pathetic. Dismal! Overall, the film was disappointed, because the lack of a story was too obvious. In fact, only a few people have left to watch the second half of the movie after the interval. <br /> <br /> There will be nothing left if you do not watch the movie. It's not worth spending valuable money for this movie. wait until it appears on TV ...
