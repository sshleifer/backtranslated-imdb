REALLY? REALLY???? I know if you do a political war movie you will notice, but this movie was just garbage. Anything in the way. Very inaccurate in many ways. I have an easier time to believe that the President of the United States fits, flies a battle plane and pulls down aliens. It's easier to write down the few things that were correct. My face dropped when I saw some saying that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was exaggerated, apparently indignant plot deviation, and had cinema questionable at times. X-box, YouTube, Rope Utilities ?? did anyone check that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you did a thorough investigation, just five years before this movie came out. I'm a war veteran in Iraq, and if you spent a day with an infantry squad or an EOD team, you would realize how B.S. this movie is. To compare this to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why not just throw Commando and Red Dawn? I think they could be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you can see the past of the incredible plot, historical and factual discrepancies, then this movie could be just OK. No more. If you continue to hear "Oscar buzz," and you need to add your own pompous review, go ahead. As far as I'm concerned, I write the director to see if I can go back 131 minutes ago.
