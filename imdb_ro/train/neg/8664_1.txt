This is just a joke to a movie, they have already lost to the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) a dangerous creature kills another creature in the cage, this is being pursued by a scientist working there on a monitor and guessing what he does, in the cage to check things out, omg how stupid the believers think people are getting closer to it, just like jumping into a fish tank with a big white shark because it ate your gold ... Quite futile and even sweeter. And I will not even talk about distribution because it's not worth the effort. why not fired the guy who wrote that it's just a mystery to me ... And this great thing continues the whole movie. Just a good thing if cgi, which is better than the average for these kind of low budget movies. If these things do not bother you, you go to see it, but be warned if IQ is over 60 likely to hate it.
