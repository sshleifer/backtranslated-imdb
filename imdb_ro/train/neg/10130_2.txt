I have almost every Seagal movie (yes, even one of a kind that has a low budget), and I have to say that this may be the worst not only of his films but of all the films ever made. The only culmination of this movie, and only the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that it is A. Seagal and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, especially in the shop and also whole army with a knife. Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people and you do not even bother with a story, because the story not only hurt, but also the actor, that the F-18 and F-14 have changed somewhat F-16, and the fact that Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also, Stealth has never had to refuel ??? And since Afghanistan is considered a hostile territory from an Air Force point of view. I checked the last time, Afghanistan does not have Air Force, we (US) control the sky. Also, this extremely secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room, but the admiral still whispers to the other guy that he is secret. Also, how did Seagal get from the bottom of the truck to the top? Okay, tell us why they have closed him since they are Air Force commanders (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when they are drunk in Arab countries, since Muslims do not drink alcohol? Besides, since the Arabs have been obeying the orders from the females as the second? The climax of the movie was surely Seagal kills people in the store, the other 50 people killed with a knife, and the extremely short and fully-chosen lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
