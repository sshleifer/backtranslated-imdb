The Animal Farm (1954) was a very good reading about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or gentlemen with an iron hand and an empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not describe any of these. What is shown to us is a piece of propaganda with a lot of finger and showing and showing. Animation and direction have been good in terms of budget and time, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is extremely lacking. If you are one of those who want to see how to adapt the novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette, then by all means of the clock. I just found it somewhat mediocre. Just a man of opinion with all this. The remake is a notch below, but not long.
