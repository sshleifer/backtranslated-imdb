This movie makes a promising start and then becomes very confused and muddled. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort to keep his appearance right, he did not seem to have spent more time on stage. Most of the small characters in the movie do not appear for any special reason. Overall, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
