I had to look at this in school. And to summarize ... Actors without talent, talentless talent and a talentless director. This movie is a waste of your time. Do not even look at the movie. Not disturb. You will be so disappointed. My professor said he should be good. How bad it was. He even slept a little. The film's actors were just bad. The best actor there was the old man and that does not say too much. He has a terrible plot of horrible characters. So, unrealistic and I can honestly say it's useless. The script was unique and confusing. There were dots in the movie when I wrinkled my eyebrows and said, "What?" There were too many weak links and holes were built. It was absolutely terrible.
