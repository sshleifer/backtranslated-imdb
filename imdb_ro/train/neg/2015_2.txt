I really look forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent, and I'm crazy about aviation, and I have a serious helicopter adventure. I do not like this program because it takes fantasy at an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx a few years ago. The only helicopter that was ever faster was the experienced Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. It struck over 300 specimens and was a compound helicopter, which means he had a propelling propeller at the end of the fuselage, pushing. In short, no helicopter can fly over 275 due to the rotating wing wing principle. And Bell 222, the "actor" who represented Airwolf was not very fast even with helicopter standards. And it has not been in production for a very long time. It was a movie that came out at this time called "Blue Thunder," which was more realistic.
