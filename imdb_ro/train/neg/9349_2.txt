This movie was terrible. I gave her a high score of 2, as we have seen worse, but very few. From the beginning of the clich√© to have the end of the film at the beginning and to return to the beginning at the end of the year, this film used everything in the box of tricks used in the film to be filmed just for his sake, as a child with too many toys. It was the repetitive narrative, cool, repetitive, slow motion, frozen frame, flashbacks and mixed images etc - none of them made a boring movie. It's called "16 years of alcohol," but there was a little drink or drink and no description of the retreat with the film jumping everywhere without any coherent meaning. The story was miserable and extremely demanding, and the direction was as weak and it is a shame that people have allocated money for several of Mr. Jobson's previously known films because they were in a group garbage and TV, the movie. I found a major struggle to see this all the way, but in the hope that it would have been better I went on until bitter, but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better not to bother.
