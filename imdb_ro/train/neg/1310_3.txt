The plot is simple, an old man who lives on a main road in the forest, one day confesses a man who kills a child in the woods. Soft For Digging follows the attempts of the old man to try to convince the police that what he saw was not a fantasy of his imagination. However, there is a problem every time the old man guides the police at the scene of the crime, no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue that reflects most scenes of the film, an old man who lives alone in the house. During the movie I found out that I was scared twice, namely when the child killed suddenly appears in front of the old man. The rest of the movie I have to admit has not hired me; I found the pace of the movie too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions after watching the film lasted too long. I feel more about the relationship, the ghostly encounters, the child and the old man. Alone in the forest during the uncertain night of your own will can lead to strange situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see Dark Water.
