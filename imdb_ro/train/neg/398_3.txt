Guys, some previous reviewers wrote almost a novel commenting on this episode. It's just a 60-year TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable due to the worst babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in an outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series that were totally limited to the sound stages. This use of an outdoor (and babe) location offers the appropriate depth and near-film quality to a fairly familiar and familiar episode of that time. Except for some notable exceptions, for example: "The Eternal City," "The Earth Mission," and "Tomorrow is Yesterday." The old series of Star Trek has to be seriously moth-scattered and taken out of dull misery. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 is a fairly poor beating average. This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced since then, in fact, contrary to the popular belief in which some people worshiped the earth that he walked, he actually made a lot of garbage! He does not deserve to be spoken in the same breath as Irwin Allen, for example. Look at the Enterprise Bridge from a modern point of view. They used floor plywood, coffee chairs with plastic back, and cheap cardboard over board panels. You can clearly see the folds of paper! Any expense exempt or what!
