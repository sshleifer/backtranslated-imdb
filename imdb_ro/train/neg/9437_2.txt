I have never considered myself a "student" when it comes to viewing movies, looking at them, forming an opinion, and that's all. But Unhinged has changed all this. This film is undoubtedly the most unequal attempt to make the movie I've ever seen. Every child who rushes to the university, thinking he will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino, must receive this film with a manual titled "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no story, filmmakers have not been competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is tracking the aerial tracking photos in the opening scenes. It never ends! It's almost like you tossed your teeth, just not so fun.
