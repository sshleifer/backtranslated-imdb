Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID beats with badly stereotyped characters to get the author sued and then shot. You could see the use of stunt man in almost every scene. And the actor is smart. Although I have to say that the line: "I'm sorry, mate, I have to take a big big pit" made me laugh at my ass.
