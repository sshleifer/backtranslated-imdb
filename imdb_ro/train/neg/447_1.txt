It has a dull distribution, though A.Bynes is okay in her perishable way, the rest is just stereotypical stupidity ... as always. We've all seen it before, and we'll probably see it again when this show is canceled. The cause, allow them to face, a mediocre and self-evident show. Because most sitcoms are .... Well, in short. If you want to see good entertainment, you can take a twenty minute break in front of the mirror. Make some faces and continue ... More fun than this show!
