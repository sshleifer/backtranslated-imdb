Yeah, I'm sure it could be a nation. . . if four of them stood at the four corners of the world, and the other two cloned billions of times. Man, I'm very glad to see this movie on FEAR.net, instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of George Romero's films and I'm pretty sure if he saw this movie, he'd probably throw it while laughing too hard. I mean, what was with raccoon girls looking like zombies and walking like Charlie's Devils? It even contributed to the fact that the musical composer chose the spectacular fashion music, when the zombies climbed up to their killer, especially when they went to the store presenting as a furniture / police / apartment / apartment / room gong in the background, and the living woman quarreled about the closed furniture store. We could not even say what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his emphasis indicated that some nations did not help either. Well, what can I expect from a movie where they cast themselves into a random battle scene without a good reason in a warehouse where they seem to carry boxes of air all over the world. So for all those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you like to browse bad movies C (C for Craptastic), then this is the movie for you. . . or not.
