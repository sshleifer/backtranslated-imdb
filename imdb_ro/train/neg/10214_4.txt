Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good together in the hands of MUM, are coming back for this very little Horror Universal offer. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as a comedian "Babe," we'll replace Fuzzy Knight as a fresh friend called "Stuff." But the results are not as charming, and the scared level is virtually null. Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of ​​kicking a treasure hunt on a remote island in an old castle. Peggy is one of the gangs on the way. But there is a tall and faint appearance of John Carradine in a black cap and a big hat known as "The Phantom" that crashes the party in search of the assets buried itself. This "ghost" is not very mysterious, and no effort is made to try to keep its normal face in the shadows to create any tension or scare. It's always nice to see Moran perpetually, but otherwise, you can do that as one of misplaced mistakes by Universal.
