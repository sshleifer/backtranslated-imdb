I will begin this by saying that I have not been able to get to the end. I took it on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I thought I could not regret my purchases. Am I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They must be forced to look at this film all the time until the end of eternity. This is the only right punishment for which I can believe I have released something so bad. Filming reminds me of the movies we used for class projects on a big old VHS. The act is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some cold cameoes. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unhappy, and the comedian of the ship is a bigger loser. It's about as much of the plot as I have understood. Generally, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and gave it to many colleagues to watch. Everyone comes back and laughs and says, "Wow I did not think I'd say I closed a Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ...." My answer is always "Well, now you can" <br /> <br />
