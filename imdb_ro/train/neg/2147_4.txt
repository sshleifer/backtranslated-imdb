The original is a relaxing clock with some truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the continuation, although not the most serious of DTV's sequels, has no spark. The biggest renunciation is the lack of a story. Just like Belle's magical world, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magic World, while marginally better, still manages to make a mess of the story. Between the guilty, we see the mice at work and I personally think that Jaq and Gus' antic are the meritorious merits of this film. The first vignette is the best, about Cinderella's usual being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were the funniest here. The worst of vignette, when Jaq turns into a man, is sometimes nice, but he has a lack of imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, she was nice too. The problem was I had not imagined that Anastasia was a friend of the Cinderella, as I thought it more abhorrent of the scenarios. This was also affected by a rather ridiculous subtle about Lucifer who fell in love with PomPom. The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to, but I hated the songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like beautiful original Tchaikovsky songs. <br /> <br /> Characters were the most powerful evolution here. Cinderella, still tidy, lost its sincerity and a lot of charm in the original, although she wears very beautiful clothes. The Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, just like Prudence and the King. As I mentioned, mice were the meritorious merits of the film, because they alone contributed to the fun of the film. I have to say that the animation is also colored over the average, and the acting voice was surprisingly good. All in all, a nice, even unofficial story that was marked by songs and the lack of a story. 4/10 for mice, acting voice, animation and some beautiful dresses. Bethany Cox
