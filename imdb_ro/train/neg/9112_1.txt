Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 are raw intentions 1, once again only poorly achieved. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. Distribution is more unknown and certainly less talented. Instead of being seductive and appealing to me to look at her, I get to feel dirty because it compares with watching a soft-core porn. I'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines of actors or writers ... and I always feel bad saying that, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was, in principle, an hour from my life. It literally amazes me that some movies are made, and that's no exception ... I can not believe it would make a third.
