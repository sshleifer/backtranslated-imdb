Well, finally, he must see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, asexuated and devoid of any real humor. I do not really know where to start, while I was delighted with this strange tribute, did not really move me. Deciding is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are way too "Disney" there is a ridiculous "six months later," is introduced after the burning Nic Cage (which did not come quite fast for my taste) Bit with Cage in the costume of bear had the joy of suppression audience as did the perforation of comedy from various "evil" on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can not quite see, reminded me of something the Strip's comic strip would have done in the eighties, a bit like their interpretation at Hollywood Strike Minatore, very strange!
