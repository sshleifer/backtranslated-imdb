The film opens with a single long shot of corridors in the factory crammed by laborers. I, what I did with the planet, you could believe. I hope we see other things like that. Rarely. When you do not look at a terrified angle of filming from the narrator in a reading room, watch him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. It would be nice if you chose areas more suited to its subject, but it does not. So, you'll hear more narratives, watch some photos and watch them prepare their room. Why not use the camera to show more landscapes? It really kills any sense of rhythm and paints the guy as more of jar in vain. I was able to read tips on how someone set up their room, fast forward through this whole movie and waste much less time.
