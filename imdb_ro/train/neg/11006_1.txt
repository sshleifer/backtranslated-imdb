This film has played, among other things, "SlapChop Offer" Vince (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not even a name that calls "quality." And with such uplifting stories as "Supermodels picking up a garbage pit" (just what it sounds like), a guy who breaks a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black fetuses from the market should to be from a jar), a lot of homosexual joke, a sketch about a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortions. The programs are painful (eg "Batman and Rhymer"), the act is not good enough to be considered amateur and the movie is gross just because it's brutal ... and stupid. I really believe that a group of 8-year-olds could have made a funny movie with the same budget. Apparently, this film led to a trial against Sint Shot Vince against Scientologists. Honestly, I would not know who to change your mind in this case! Apparently, he said Scientologists somehow destroyed his reputation and sank this movie. It does not matter that the movie is a repulsive junk from the beginning to the end and 99% unhappy (by comparison, Ebola is more funny) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the movie. , who is Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in the fake porn movie. It is amazing that his career could overcome this.
