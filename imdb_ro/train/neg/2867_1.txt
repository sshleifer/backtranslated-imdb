I slept on the bed with a cold or very bad flu or anything else. I was thinking I'd kill some time watching horror movies my mom bought me a while ago. I wish I never chose this movie! After I saw him, I felt even worse and wanted to throw. After doing something better, I did some research about Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope nobody will ever watch your movie, but if you never eat or feel the way I felt after watching it for the first time. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better comments on this site.
