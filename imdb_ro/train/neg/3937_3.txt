It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his famous X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, at the peak of glory. Nine years later, he was almost forgotten, and his attempts to make it on the big screen failed. I can not even explain why he is a good actor, but perhaps his fictional moment has cast him into an eternal role that has great talent to break. At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well-known, and she was really lucky that a movie like Playing God did not lead her career to a dead end. Fortunately for her, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" are waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was released. There's not much to say about this movie. It's Andy Wilson's big screen movie and there's got to be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what happens on the screen, expected in this story by a former physician who saves the life of a tragic victim in a bar just to find that he works for the crowd. The off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moralist text that kills any hint of cinematic experience in the movie. You probably will not meet the movie, but in DVD rental stores or on TV. Try looking for something better.
