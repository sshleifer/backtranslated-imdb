Sorry that this movie did not scare me to annoy me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and it fell off the road. The kids! Father! Premonition! It had so much potential and zilt! zero, bum! I've heard everything before. Frightening! Not! I can scare myself, here, where I sit, than in the movie. Are there men writing this figure that women should be so annoying? It is not like that? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / writer bothered to work it. We could have had good music that would have added to the tension if someone had made the effort. What I want to know is why I get the money? Give it to me and save it all. Abandoned? ... Not where I betrayed
