with this attempt by the ABC family of the "cheaper with the dozen" hit blockbuster, comes an unpleasant amount of corny dialogue, superficial plotting, and brickbacks. With about two good actors among those who want to be, this movie was a great disappointment. It's a Hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already evil plot. Then, because they needed a lot of actors, that meant they would probably be better. The actor was not five stars. The land moved fast enough, and the twists were bad and had a horrible moment. The character knot and "end-to-end relationships" were also too strange and clingy to me. Destroy and rent something better.
