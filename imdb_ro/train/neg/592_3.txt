All the logic goes straight from the train window in this British horror film, which is underground in London and plays in Run Lola Run, Franka plays Kate, a business woman on the road to an office meeting meet friends asleep at a subway station just to wake up and find she was locked up and wakes up as being watched by someone or something with intentions of murder. <br /> <br /> The incredible pitfalls are full and there are very few moments that are actually pimples / scary, but a lot that is simply boring. Generally, an unpleasant movie that should remain locked underground forever and make us a favor to everyone. > <br /> The only plus point here is to include in the distribution of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who did better than that? this even includes "Erasmus Microman"!
