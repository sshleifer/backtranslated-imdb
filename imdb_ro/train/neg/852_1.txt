I'm going to keep this short. This "adaptation" of the wonderful King's Book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously found its way into the top -250. Jack Nicholson is ridiculous like Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess, and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete tips. My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters in this story: Stay on the TV series. Oh, and the people who say that Kubrick had every right to destroy the king's story because King is not ... a good writer should stay on reviewing "masterpieces" like "wide eyes closed."
