I see the guys preparing the budget for this movie. "Well, let us see now, we will spend 50% to get Dirk Benidict, because the Battle Star Galactic and the team were cool. We spend 40% doing a Demon costume, it does not bother that Demon should to be incorporeal in the script And we spend the rest doing the movie This was pretty bad and very cliche .... Have a loved one present when you watch (or bring a good book)
