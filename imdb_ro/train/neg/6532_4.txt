The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost, but just floating in space, close to the planet. When recovered, one of the crew members is sick, one is alive, and the other two are missing. What happened to them is said through a retrospective of the surviving member. While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a lot of very stupid monsters with stingy eyes. Strangely, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the fools I've ever seen in the movie. In addition, in a strange experiment of realism, production used a process called "Cinemagic". Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation made the film seem pretty cheap when you were on Mars and intensity roşcării made my eyes almost bloody - it was THAT bad! Despite all the cheese, the movie had a somewhat interesting story, as well as a good message about space travel. For lovers of gender, it is worth seeing. For others, you can find everything stupid enough - see and decide. While by today's standards is not very good science fiction film, compared to films made at the time, is stiveste pretty good. <br /> <br /> PS - When watching the movie, pay special attention to Dr. Tremayne. It looks like Dr. Quest's spitting image from the cartoon "Jonny Quest"! Plus, it sounds and behaves a lot like him.
