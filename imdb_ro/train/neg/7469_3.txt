The script for this television soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at one point had to play as a school theater student to bring life to his dead character. I do not know if this was the purpose of the director, but Hopkins' Ciano only wanted to get revenge, to fear and not to have self-esteem. True Ciano was possible, but then, why make a movie about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long way was as close as possible to the truth. Edda Mussolini was simply ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent scenario), while she had to be the central character of this supposed family drama. Watch it only if you enjoy the theater of Venezuelan theater.
