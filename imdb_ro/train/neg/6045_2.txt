This is an interesting bad idea. The hidden meanings in art remaining as clues by a serial killer sound intriguing, but the execution of "Anamorph" is awfully slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie than boring. The indications of death are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives credible performance as an investigator, but has little to do with a scenario that is stretched to the limit. Several support characters are wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as Chief of Police, Paul Lazar as Medical Examiner, and especially Deborah Harry, who is featured on the back of the DVD case, a few lines spoken through a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
