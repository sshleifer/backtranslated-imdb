Documentary about Persian nomads making a passage of massive mountains to take their flocks to the grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, partly marked by an oriental music score that could not be used in the original exhibition, is even sweeter than it sounds. The spectacular landscape is lost on a small black-and-white screen and there is a total failure to fix any type of plot line. I loved Nanook in the north and march of the penguins, but he despised this film, despite the likeness of the theme. Only physical weights are not so interesting.
