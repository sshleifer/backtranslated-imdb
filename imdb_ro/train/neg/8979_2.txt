Jon Pertwee said, "It's very difficult to be fun, but very easy to be stupid." Well, if that's the case, PASTY FACES is "Very Easy". David Baker (as a director / screenwriter) and his distribution seem to be under the impression that the comedy involves the theft of scenes and style from the supreme British such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a totally underdeveloped scenario and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey particularly suffers from this type of OTT performance, but it is not enough to destroy the movie, because it is not enough to destroy a movie. PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially in the scenic sense. I did not understand why it ended like she did, it seemed to stop in a very steep and stupid way. Oh and other flagrant mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there - This movie should think you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorization - You still pay to donate blood to America - People who know in America and who give blood say my payments for donations stopped a few years ago and that you can buy any kind of weapons in a weapons store. As far as I know, America's weapons laws differ from state to state, but no weapons store sells anti-tank weapons on the counter. So, we have a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal film and so dysfunctional. Perhaps this is the vengeance for BRAVEHEART that it is a very big Hollywood view of scoops? Maybe, but that does not prevent PASTY FACES from being a bad comedy
