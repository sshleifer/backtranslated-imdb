That was not good news. You have this nut riding around the sun lit in a buggy with a sun umbrella over it, killing people for their own reasons. You have the same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting off parts of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere where wolves are out there that are not there. What is the purpose of this film? Could Bruce Dern not find anything better to do? It was a film loss.
