God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and images here), but what about the truth? Everything behind "naturally born killers" seems to be an "intelligent" look at how media can turn into garbage completely, but unfortunately the film turns into garbage itself. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of television shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same thing with the movie! Michael Haneke said quite intelligently about this film that he denounces fascist media fascism with fascist cinematic ways. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache that you have after staying in that too much load of nonsense!
