I saw the original German nemedicated version and I was surprised at how bad this movie is. Thinking of seeing my part of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabin Grannies, Zombie Lake and so on, nothing would have prepared me for that! It was really a pain to stay with this movie because there is no plot, no good action, and no special effects are convincing, especially zombies so-called, wearing nothing more than white makeup and their clothes old, so their good set would not be ruined by the spots of ketchup and marmalade. <br /> <br /> If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then look at it, for all the others, you do not, because you will regret it!
