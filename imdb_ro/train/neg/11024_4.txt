I saw the first film in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply written by the censorship committee. But then in Poland in 2000, I looked at it in a complete form. So what? The plot is incredibly incomprehensible - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on a planet full of strong, straight and extremely serious feminine women. Men are now trying to fight and then a lot of stupid clich√©s - sex drive, constant desire for male sex, feminists who are shown as complete idiots (can agree with them or not, but idiots certainly do not. are), and so on. The show of the Jerzy Stuhr steward is here in wood and strangely bad - he just pulls unhappy faces and repeats saying expressions such as "I'm in the elevator with a nude chicken and I did nothing!" It was intended to be a comedy, but it turned out to be a hoax full of spells, full of predictable and innocent jokes beneath the waist. Do not waste your time with it - it's bad.
