Hmm, Hip Hop music in a Western period. Modern phrases such as "cool" and too many others to keep track of. "Sistah is in the house"! Microphone packages clearly set on the back of Li'l Kim. I can not continue with the litany of errors made by the director and editors. The act is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women did pretty well with a poor script. It was strange hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent. The girls are beautiful. Fabulous costumes, even if they are completely incorrect. I can not believe he's made a wonderful story. I would feel offended to think that this movie was loaded with such traps that it would play well in the inner city. <br /> <br />
