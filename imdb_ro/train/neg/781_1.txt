This show was absolutely terrible. Because a George is not funny, and his kids are snobbish brothers. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Hispanic, I am extremely offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed. In addition, the problem of the dysfunctional family was done with death. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show fun when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would get to its senses and take this piece of garbage out of the air, but unfortunately we will have to stomach it until they "skip the shark". In my opinion, they already did.
