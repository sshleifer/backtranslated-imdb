A little of a disappointing film, I would say: the act was stuck in a way. In many cases, I could not feel that facial expressions corresponded to spoken words or the intention of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the spectator believe he is upset (or sad, happy, frustrated). This is not happening here. <br /> <br /> The commentary on the writers assuming you already know the characters is apt. They do things and say things that come from nowhere: the Andrei character accuses his parents of passing their signals to dinner; then blows up and breaks out, telling his father, "Do not touch me, you!" Perhaps, if we had seen the prequel, we could understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat at sea in terms of reason! <br /> <br /> A strange, weird thing, which Andrew does, is to go to an old stone quarry to sit on the top; then go into your jeans pocket and pull out a pack of cigarettes and light up one. He did the same three times during the movie; Do I think we should see this as tortures of loneliness and loneliness? Maybe once, but three times? It may have been four times, I lost the number. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he has recently learned he has adopted; this happens very early in the movie, so there is no point in any dramatic change that she might suffer from this discovery. It's not clear if this is so bitter or if it's something else. I think there is some sort of Lynchian feeling about the film, but should a director for the first time try to drop such a mountain so early in his career?
