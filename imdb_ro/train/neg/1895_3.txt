1975 MASTER OF THE GUILLOTINE FLYING is an amazing and wonderful movie to watch. This is not because the fight is inspired in particular or because the movie has some meaning. It's because the movie is so stupid and so exalted that it's a classic camp - bad but pleasant bad. The movie plays a blind guy who has a Frisbee device as a chain that drives people's heads as he completely throws it at his enemies! Who cares that physics is impossible, or that the movie presents such stupid things as 12-meter-long gunsmiths or the guy was blind! It's just a ball to watch from the beginning to the end - and one of my favorite movies "bad" and wonderful to see with friends. Because of this film, I was eager to see FLYING FILM GUILLOTINES (1977), though, unfortunately, it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a beat - taking many of the original ideas but neglecting to make the film as coherent or tracked. Sure, it's fun, but never comes to MASTER OF THE GUILLOTINE FLYING worth entertainment. Like the original movie, there are these strange flying devices that pull out the head, but they are quite different - with circular blades and almost a mind of their own. There is also no blind guy, but a bunch of bad guys that have no depth, and the audience does not understand exactly what's going on in the English version because the plot is completely incomprehensible. However, at the same time, some of the martial arts is very good. Although it does not meet the high standards of most of Bruce Lee's and Sonny Chiba's films, the action is useful despite the ridiculous and often confusing plot. Generally, this is a movie that fans of martial arts may want (despite their numerous, many, many, many), but one that others will hide or laugh hysterically instead of enjoying action, because the film is just as absurd. BUT, most importantly, never approaching being as funny or as pursuing the GUILLOTINE FLYING MASTER. Sin.
