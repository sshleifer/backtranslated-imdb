Okay, I can not think seriously anything worse than the PR series. There are many evil things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of something worse than fifty-six teenagers (who do not even act like an ordinary teenager) dancing in identical costumes of different colors so you can tell them? Fans, have you ever met a real person who struggles against a mental wall and rises almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys and I think I never liked this show when I was five years old. I think you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Adolescents actually act like adolescents, and Tommy Oliver actually behaves like a mentor or not, a teacher. He has adolescent humor, although battles are blades, I do not hate Dino Thunder. Many people say the Power Rangers are stupid, but I would not. It would be an insult to the nonsense. So, girl, five-year-olds, the Power Rangers are garbage.
