I tried to look at this film without really being able to stand by it, because although it is supposed to be a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to a certain interpretation of Scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. Besides, I'm a film maniac and the action in this movie was completely unacceptable. I never wanted to record a negative film. So if you want to be uninterruptedly preached by those without authority, then, by all means, you get this movie. This comment is also a warning to those who love or love scifi, because the title will also deceive a lot of people. It was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and these possibilities were scattered. The exclusive quality of the film is that it made me realize that the Machine Time character would probably have shown a less moral revolt against the strange behavior of those in her future.
