In the first forty minutes, Empire really forms: it seems to be a powerful, confident and relatively unknown gangster film. When I did not know why, I thought it was good ... but now I do. <br /> <br /> One of the main issues with this movie is that it's pure and disgusting. I do not mind the psychotherapy films and things to prove a point of view - Jackie Brown, for example - but all are so terribly superficial in this sense, but that's obviously being released for entertainment. You literally feel that a node pulls in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is dizzy, arrogant, but quite ironic - not so bad. She does not seem pretty close enough to be a killer of women dealing with drugs. The fact is that at the end of the day, this movie is completely pretentious. It's not slick, not smart, just boring and meaningless - this colossal misery should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (1 of 5)
