As long as it seemed the longest time for a 35-year term I had to support for a long time, Al Pacino offers an accurate performance to be sure. It's not his usual guy, which was beautiful. But his character was pathetic. Someone to fight as he stops forgetting about appointments as we realize that Hollywood's social life has drained him from the energy of his life. But in this movie we needed someone to like. And for some reason, every character in the picture said "I do not know why I like Eli," to Al Pacino, and I could not get close to him. other actors have played their usual styles. Leoni Tea, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their characters on television or previous films. And Kim Basinger has not even been in the film long enough to offer a show of any kind. The story of the movie had no time. Most scenes never lead the story before, but only collecting factoids about characters that later came into play in an anti-climatic end. He had the potential, except for the refusal to build the story. What does the movie mean? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have thought that "once you've made Hollywood, you can not go out." Yeah sure! That's why so many people are fired at Hollywood.
