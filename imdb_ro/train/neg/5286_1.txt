I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever to come to the US. I had to save my money. What's going on with Anne after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. It is not impulsive and vulgar. And Maria, has a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor her normal course. There is no chemistry between the two main characters who have completely done their "romanticism" completely unbelievable. In the final stage they even had Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not follow the 1995 version, which, although it had flaws, remained pretty close to the book. The book, I do not even think I read it. This is some sort of Cliff's Notes's film of persuasion. Press all the high points without explaining anything.
