I do not know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment I was irritated. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they make this decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do criminals act badly, though they managed to get a huge amount of money from a bank and get away with it? Why is not the helicopter the main killer, shooting Stallone, taking the money and flying the chicken as a hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give this film 5 points for a nice action and a great scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can give this film 1 point ...
