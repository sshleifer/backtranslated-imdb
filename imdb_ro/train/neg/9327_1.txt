This has been the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some REAL negative movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover seemed to be a decent horror movie. I did not really know that coverage would be the best part of the film. Where to start? Film filming has been scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving on a farm on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they drove only silently. The whole movie is boring, with an annoying, unbelievable dialogue and actually no plot to talk about. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
