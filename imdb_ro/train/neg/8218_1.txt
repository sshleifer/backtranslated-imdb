I've never finished this movie for some reason, it was terrible, and that's just the act. I was not even sure what the movie was, that it did not make much sense and that the violence was terrible. I mean ususally like nude in a movie (lol), but it was just sick due to what's going on. All the characters got angry and they were just full of screams, and the camera shuddered and seemed a continuation of the blair with the project, but with no good qualities. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time and I would love my time back, please. I would not recommend this movie to anyone or even consider it. (N)
