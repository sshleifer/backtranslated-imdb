Yes he is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to strip off their actors and show their private publics. Pintilie IS "Emperor" naked - so to speak ... It is the right time for someone to tell the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, an arm blocked in an old man's body. His abundance of nude scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It is a 100% visual perversion: he makes his strikes by making the actors sneak in their comb and look at them. And if he does this to the audience, he could get into a difficult situation! Did you know that on the set of "Niki Ardelean" it made him Coke Blossy poor, saying, "Oh, Coca, how do I want to be to you!"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she has become uselessly ashamed of her satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian public, so many people are still so stupid to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! Will anyone ever be decent to expose the truth about all this?
