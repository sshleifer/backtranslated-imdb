I got really caught up in this movie, at least in the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic! But that's over. I seem to be very good when I imagine who the killer is and I like when a movie can mislead me completely, but I felt outside and I lied to him, they always lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end of the year, did not give any result to this, it does not mislead the writing and the very poor planning, someone did not think at all! I felt the movie would have been much better if it had been stuck in the plot you were leading, and they seemed to not respond to anything, why Jane (Maria) burned the teacher's house. as I felt it started out as a relatively good film.
