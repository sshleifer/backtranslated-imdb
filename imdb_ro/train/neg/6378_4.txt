This movie was fun sometimes, sometimes he was even funny. The basic message we received from the film, however, was that women are responsible for all human problems. Every time a woman is described in the movie, she is lazy, being slutty or lambasting a poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message is good for women or gay men. But it's a comedy and a piece of art, so it's just a person's point of view. Even if I disagree with it, they still have a right to this. A funny movie, but some of the comments others have made are just bad. The best movie ever my foot.
