I remember watching this movie several times as a very young child and being parts of it (many in fact) that I did not understand. I think I once saw him as an adult and then I understood those parts. The only problem with the adult look was that I did not have fun at all. So what kind of movie is that? Is it a movie for children? Not hard. Contains language and topics that are not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what each parent feels is happening to their children? Maybe, but why would not he focus on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a movie has a 7-year-old character to do well with its audience, it should be a movie for the seven and under the crowd, otherwise older people than these will have no connection (even 8 he would not want to see a movie about a kid who is a younger year than them). I'm pretty sure this movie did not do well in the box office, and the reason is that it did not succeed in finding a niche on the market.
