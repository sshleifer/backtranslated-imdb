Quote: Theurgist: Anyone has an I.Q. over 50 would have seen this film what it is, an intelligent precursor acting in a modern classics, yes, it does not have a blockbuster or a huge budget but it is still very well made and caught up for the whole duration. <br /> <br /> An IQ over 50 that you say ... that most means you have an I.Q. less than 50 .. His name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! which means you should have something with the first one to make ... and a good movie if you .. CHANGE THE TITLE AND ANY CHARACTERS REQUIRED BY CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps does not comment on a movie if you know nothing about movies. but I think a I.Q. under 50, you will not know what the hell I'm crying ... <br /> <br /> Peace out!
