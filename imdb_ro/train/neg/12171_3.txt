Being an aficionado of the movie, I usually sit down to watch every slash movie that passes over my retina, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I will say. While the second night's surf channel, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross the paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I've heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but I have never seen any of them (for shame, I know). I will notice that, since I have not seen the original, my criticism should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is entirely intended by the design of the franchise. assuming that the franchise of the Sleepaway camp is, in itself, a joke in itself. Hell, even the name comes as an intentional joke. Sleeping away from the camp? It's fun. I can appreciate the movie because I just want to put together something for the horror of the pure camp, but that's how I can go. The actress in this film has made the distribution of the original version on Friday show that the spirits are teaching Macbeth. Campy requires bad action, but come on. Pamela Springsteen, as a bad killer of reality, has done a better job of killing my interest than having killed the entire distribution. Regarding the comedy, there were several times where I chuckled, but it was few and far between. Eventually, SAC II is pretty boring, and I even wanted to sleep dormitory camp. The deaths are so obvious and false that you can hardly appreciate them. If you are looking for a good movie slasher comedy comedy, I recommend Club Dread. If channel navigation will get you over, check out and see what else is.
