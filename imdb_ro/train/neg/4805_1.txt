I liked Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great in the Top Model and was very happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems a great guy. But this show just made me SICK! I'm so upset both about what happened on that show. I do not care that they were different ages, I know age can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for seven months. I'm not surprised at what he did not propose. And I do not see the need to force someone to get married before they're ready. If it is to be, then why not just enjoy each other and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was totally useless, it is obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you because you broke up and you set it up anyway! You went through two failed marriages, how could you hurry into another marriage just because it made a match? I hope the relationship lasts, but I think the marriage has been hurried and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe I can now breathe and find the right reasons to be married in the marriage.
