The true shame of the "assembly" is not in the bad action or in the superficial plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series he started, though he had a main attraction: Takashima. I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. It has that sarcasm, with that double personality that is just as volatile and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story that involves the assassination. Patricia Tallman - who has not returned seriously until the end of the series - much later - fortunately, has become much better with age like Lyta Alexander, who is just a tired and disturbing telepath. I want to leave you with a last thought ... Why does Delenn look like a space frog man (even if a woman)? Thank heaven for the way Minbari looked later in the show.
