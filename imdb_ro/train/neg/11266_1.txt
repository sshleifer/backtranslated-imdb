Well, what am I to say ... After seeing the movie, I still have to wonder what the hell really was? The camera's camera moves in the yard at a time ... I had to look away from the screen, I felt physically ill ... Round and round and round ... You have an idea ... <br /> <br /> VERY VERY strange accents in many places .... "Those who should know, know" <br /> <br /> Unless you enter for free or are paid to watch it or your partner is about to it makes you paint the house or something .. then you forget it ...
