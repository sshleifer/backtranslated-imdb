This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's (I think) a story about a rebel college basketball player, his tough but faithful coach, his girlfriend and a colleague (who played Michael Margotta), who has constant nervous disturbances. The story does not go anywhere, there is a development of the zero character, there is no one to care about, and the performances, except for Bruce Dern as coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such a terrible movie. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
