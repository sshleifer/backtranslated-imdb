It was an atrocious loss of my time. No plot. The act was so downright, it should be used as a copy in the classes of action you do not have to do. It's just a commercial rupture of the former university soldier, which also overturns the bottom of the barrel that acts. It is sad that VD has to affirm its ego every few years, and sadder yet that people will pay good money to stay in it. This kind of schock offers martial arts movies a bad name. By comparison, it makes Segall, Norris and Arnold seem almost talented. Perhaps VD should take Leslie Nielson's track and make references to his genre. At least then we could laugh with him instead of him.
