the only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Ordinary. The line of plot about Gary Sinise's character trying to commit suicide is a ridiculous premise and you will feel him as a sort of salingeric recluse or retreat in a boat driving the golf balls in the ocean because he could not do you live in the pro / am golf community? Cry Me a River. I wish these were my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a salary check for Sinise. The scene where little Timmy Price is verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tour is so high I am ashamed to see him
