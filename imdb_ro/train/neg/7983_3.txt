On the whole, overloaded and full of subplots than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wants to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. In addition, the movie is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken as regards the legal system in committing French citizens against their will and apparently the ease of evading drugs in French hospitals. I watched this movie on my TV on my home screen and woke up shouting the movie to continue. Finally, finally, I passed the long final speech that one of the main characters made to his ex-boy's son. Until then, I was dazzled by the complicated plot, dealing with a dead boyfriend, a marriage of convenience and an ex-boyfriend. Sometimes the plot goes to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - Ismael or Nora first. To the detriment of the audience, the views continue to change from Nora and Ishmael, her ex-boyfriend was confined to his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films, none of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really end many of the sub-parcels and seems to want the spectator to believe that Nora will find happiness somehow, though it dates its circumstances in real life, the chances are equivalent to a chance of a snowball in hell. The actors do everything they can and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the mistakes of poor writing, editing, and lack of focus.
