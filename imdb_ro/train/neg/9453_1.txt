The holy cow, what kind of film is this film. I did not realize how these directors could take a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I think they did not even know! I do not remember any farting or bad in this book, is it? They all took classic classics, added some furting, laughing and sexing, and prostituted her in a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea about how these Hollywood producers think. I have to say, visually, it was interesting, but the bright visual story is ruined by the toilet's humor (if you really think this is funny) I do not want the kids I know to believe it is. > <br /> Do not let the kids see, do not rent the DVD. I hope Dr. Suess's ghost will come and haunt the people who made this film.
