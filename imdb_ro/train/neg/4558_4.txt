Frankly, I was disappointed with the "Expiration Date". Very clever title and interesting premise, but I do not think it was issued. What was that about? The desire of the main character to reconnect with the native roots? Or, more likely, he had to overcome his fear of death. But he was not set up as someone who lived his life in fear - it seems his life is going well, but as the day of judgment approaches, he should start worrying now. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not seem to have needs to blend into a big story. Everyone was doing things, parallel to the main character. Also, what was treated as a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he just plan to stay in his apartment all day of his birthday? These are my criticisms, but I liked the Seattle strikes, the cinema was beautiful, the action was good at times when it was not remarkable.
