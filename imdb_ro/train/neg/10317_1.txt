Until this new season I was a great fan of the "Little Mosque". However, the new season has absolved it absolutely. The new Christian vicar has destroyed the whole intent of the show. It has always been to live together to overcome prejudices. The New Vicar ruins that prefigure and show Christians in a very bad light. I am neither Christians nor Muslims, but loved watching the show and seeing friendship between Amar and the Reverend. There is nothing else. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and do it with her. It's not worth watching. It could be saved, but there should be a lot of change. Revert the old format.
