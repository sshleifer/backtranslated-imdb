This is one of those films that should have been a lot better than it turned out to be. I'm afraid to think about what the Blockbuster-approved edition looks like, because cutting the director on DVD was a boredom of epic proportions. Of course, do not expect him to be the "Godfather," but an acting class or two would have come in handy. Also, there were so many nice guys in this movie, but they were poorly exploited. I like to see a bunch of baskets around them in BVDs as much as the next guy, but even I have the right to expect a little more. But it was not a total loss; at least we have a look at a Drew Fuller (covered) junk and really disturbing haircut. And Huntley Ritter looks even more cute than he did in the movie "Bring On" (and he does). There's always a silver lining, kids. You have to look very hard for that. And, occasionally, you have to use the pause button.
