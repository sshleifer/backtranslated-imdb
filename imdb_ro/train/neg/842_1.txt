That's not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hard in it. This movie was terrible. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not describe how idiotic it is. I'm sorry Michael. The cinema was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you follow it, it feels like a soft porn, but without nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual vestiges because it's a S & M underground killer. The act was bad, except for the parts of Michael Madsen. She looked like she wanted to laugh. I hope he was paid well for this terrible movie. It's something I would not be proud of. It's not even a B film for cable, it's more like an F and should never be ever shown.
