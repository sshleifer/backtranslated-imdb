Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I've seen the promotional material a lot and I'm expecting a professional movie, like "Stormriders" - what I was introduced to was a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. Without Atmosphere, very boring, more than worse Battle scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I will have the chance to make a movie like this and then I will show how to make such a movie !!! My Asian tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> We are sorry for my bad english!
