I thought watching videos about hiring companies was boring. This movie did not go anywhere quickly. What could have been a half-hour twilight episode was turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on the people who parked their cars, a picture of the pool of a guy (indeed he has to answer on the close phone) his work and Heuy and Louey standing in a yellow light control room repeating "T minus 10 and counting" as if something interesting would happen. Do not make your hopes up. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC in something other than famous television celebrities and stretching out to find something good. And it does NOT make me start with music that was totally composed of a Tympani, big marine mammals and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I gave her one, but it gets 2, because I actually managed to finish this insomnia treatment and did not have to go in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
