I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment how terrible this movie is ... my cats and a string have a better story than that. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but when you destroy almost all the cast of the movie in 5 minutes, it leaves a little to be desired. There was no single "frightening" moment in the movie, unless they watched the movie "Halloween" on the TV. Around, it seems that it could have been a good story, running the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss because I did not recognize her right away and her scene was already over before "I'm so glad I saw this in a hotel and did not pay for it because I would have checked if I had paid a cents to see that. normal, I like or can find at least one redemption factor in a movie, but that's an exception. It's so bad that it's not even so funny so good ... it's bad ... it's pure and simply bad.
