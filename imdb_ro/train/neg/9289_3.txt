for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in your original movie, your chance is, and then go back to the real world. The guy who hid the gold in the first film told Twitch, so he was transferred to another prison, where the wrestling mobs hang around the search. Twitch intends to leave prison within a month to get the gold to start a life with his wife. Then something happens and someone is shot, and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the fighter's daughter is trapped in everything, so he and the twitch go to find her and Twitch's wife. As you can imagine, the act is under the hair, it has a lot of (very annoying) rap music, and poorly played battle scenes. Besides, it's that the Hispanic is kissing in him, playing in every jail / action / thriller ever made and closing a door in that. It's not very full of events, but at least it's harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a massive fan of the original, it's good. If not, you were warned.
