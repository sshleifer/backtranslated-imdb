Was this the leading role in cinema? the character, leon, is pretty funny, but shortly thereafter jokes and sexual humor are too bad to listen to. some movies can escape with sexual jokes and base their audience to know when they are being advertised. some movies that do this are American pie and scary movie. the scary movie was bad and the American pie would not have done well without the jokes. the only role, besides the leon who had some humor that followed, would be ferrell. the character was really stupid and that was all, the humor was all that was watching me. the movie was ok, and nothing else. I really do not understand why snl people who die about leaving the show always get a movie based on a character they played at the show. diving takes about 5 minutes and if I can make a movie on a 5 minute sketch, then what's the world coming for? molly shannon had a superstar, the o'terri cheri had a scary movie, but she was not a main actor and had an elf. but that was good, but he did a bad movie, but I do not remember, and mike myers with his world wayne. how is the crazy TV crew ever getting movies? saw only one guy, but only in 2 movies and a television show with Andy Dick. but this guy is based on comedy to continue his life, funny or not. this movie is not good, but it has some positive humor. what loss of film and people's money.
