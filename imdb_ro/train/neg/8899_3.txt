Where is it written that the sequela must suck? Scream 2 did not! Others did not! But this sure ... Problems include horrific actors (only Christopher Walken might act in the whole movie), bad writing (you will never understand what happens and even have done research on Nephilim's idea before) and just horrible choices for casting. Eric Roberts makes the most stupid Archangel Michael that I have ever seen in my life! Avoid it like the plague if you're not desperate to see Christopher Walken. In this case, just fast forward to the parts in which you are in the movie and avoid others. Yech !!!
