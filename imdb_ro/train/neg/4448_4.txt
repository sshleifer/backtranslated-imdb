The strong start of a movie when the character Julia Roberts is perforated in front of her abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a strong movie at the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was a wrong leader. This movie was nothing like the burning bed that had power, and Farrah played the role of a woman you really felt, and you felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy escaped after the first act of cheap emotion, and Roberts stole the death to get rid of her husband and went to live in Iowa. Her husband at first thinks she is dead, but she starts to grow suspicious that she may live and go after her. The rest of the movie is basically a game of cats and mice with Julia getting a home in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity ... there is no mention, of course, how she got the money for it, but right now the film did not care too much. He meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him, and her husband finally gets caught up to her, but not before she rearranges her soup boxes and straightens the kitchen. It was supposed to offer a cheap emotion to the audience. But I did not care too much if she was an abusive wife because the movie, as I said, deceived the audience. If it were the course that I would have felt for her and her situation. Of course, the husband is murdered and everything is good for Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world was something close to that ... See the burning bed and understand what should be a movie about the subject of domestic abuse.
