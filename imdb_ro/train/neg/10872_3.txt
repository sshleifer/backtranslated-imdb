Here's an indie movie that I really wanted to like but eventually she could not. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the headlines) really shows and kills the image. The story is a great mess that is not worth trying to figure out. I got bored quickly in 10 minutes, then suffered for the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before reaching the chapter that stops to get to the end (meritorious) ... even it does not deserve extra effort . OZARK SAVAGE is trying very hard to be smart, raising the best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, in OZARK SAVAGE there are not many things that have not been done before and better. This movie would have been much more fun than a short 10-20 minutes, but as a feature it feels just padded and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons that I suppose they reasoned to be stretched at 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows a great promise and I wish him good luck.
