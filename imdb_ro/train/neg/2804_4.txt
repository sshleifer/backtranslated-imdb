Probably I was spoiled after seeing the 1973 release with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack for the first time, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I did not get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of theater and theater actors just do not do it for me and what it was about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. If the casting director actually read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester is certainly not! And Zelah was just, okay, weird, a couple of mixing. In her favor, the support distribution was pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best adaptation, but generally did not capture any magic of the novel. Of course, it would not require anyone to look at it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointed!
