Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! It is composed of extremely weak effects and unrealistic effects, which made me chase in my chair, seriously, my cat could have done better than this batch. Some of them were ridiculous, because it was so incredible. they would have ranked at this inferior level, but they have nothing else! So, remember my warning and if you do not get bored so close to suicide and want a good reason to continue the suicide mission, do not bother with it. I am still in shock that this could be made available to the public, it should be a crime and all those involved should be arrested. I've been gathered so far, so I'll let you decide.
