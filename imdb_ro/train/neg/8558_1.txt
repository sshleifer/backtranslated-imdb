This movie was absolutely terrible, I feel really awkward calling a movie. It's the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a twenty-year-old whiny bunch that gets stuck around trying to "figure." I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but let me be honest, even horrible. I'm not out of sync with cinema, I appreciate the films Dogme95, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies. So I do not mind if a movie is made cheap, as long as there is a substance (any). Everything in this movie is horrible, the actor, the writing (or everything was improvised?), The direction, but most of all, above all, room work was simply stupid. The room was never logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit that I'm a guy I heard was nudity in this movie, so I thought well, even if at least horribly it was nudity (yes, I know, I'm a bastard). Well, thanks to the uber crappy shooting room, you never get to see anything and the things you see, TRUST ME - DO NOT WANT EVERYTHING. This movie made me want to vomit on many levels. The dialogue made me want to vomit, the work with the room made me want to vomit, but especially the idea that this film was praised by some legitimate critics, now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
