I do not know anything about Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of this story. However, as independent film, I found this very boring. Battle scenes have tried to be great and spectacular, but they were just CGI. The act is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt has been expressed only to attract ladies. But he does not make a good warrior, too beautiful I am afraid. Good points are design. This film looks good with the impressive castle landscape and buildings / walls. I like a movie that tries at least to get the true personal accents, but this movie seems to completely ignore it. I have heard American English, Scottish, nothing but what you could expect for a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. Generally, I do not recommend this movie for a family. It's too long and young people will get bored. For adults, it's good if you do not care about the lack of realism.
