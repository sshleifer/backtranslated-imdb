I went to see this movie (actually, I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the festival in Mar del Plata (Argentina) ... just and I simply could not look! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of the cutting times and have a look from time to time. When it was over, my stomach was head down and I felt light. I wanted to leave the cinema a few minutes after the start of the second short (BTW, of course I was not the only one to leave the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I'm impressed by many courageous people who actually loved him. I just do not understand how you can love those movies! The shocking and bloody and terrifying images I've seen have really stayed in my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my friend saw everything and told me about it) and I just do not think it makes sense. I mean, that amount of violence and other things, you just try to shock people. And it's not a good enough reason, I guess. There is absolutely nothing in this movie I can say "Well, at least" x "the thing about it was good." But, well, I think I will never understand such movies.
