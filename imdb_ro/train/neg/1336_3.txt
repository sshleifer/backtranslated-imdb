This movie was certainly not one of Mary-Kate's and Ashley's best movies. I really did not like it and I was rather disappointed with that movie. For some reason, it seemed that it was a movie they really made really fast. In some parts, it was so boring that I had to move it forward. It had no bloopers or interesting parts like their other movies.
