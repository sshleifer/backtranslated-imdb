It has to be the most corny TV show in the air. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother suffocated all the talent outside of his younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and not to speak again except with a negative use. Jim must retreat or something. Please, let go of the air. If I had a joke from that show, I would throw up and brush my eyes with a toothbrush. I prefer to be taken from the devil myself rather than pursuing half an hour of programming. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know we're sleeping with the TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, do not ask.
