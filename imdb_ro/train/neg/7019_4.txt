After seeing the poster in the movie Smother, I knew I was going to live one of those intolerable movie experiences that made me want to take my eyes. Still, I felt a little optimistic because the movie had a solid cast that I thought was going to save the movie. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Mother is a horrible movie, but she is not extrovert. This is the best thing I can say about this scenario. the same guys from the License to Mie, something that explains they have nothing but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor.

After the large number of garbage she has been involved in (such as the monumental atrocious and exuberant because I said so), some people might think of Diane Keaton's career goes out. she has brought to our forefront our decades, films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother, she is doing her best with her performance, but her character is written so terrible she can not do anything with her. Daff Shepard gave me a good impression with solid performances on the Baby Mama and Idiocracy films. However, he does everything he can with his character. Mike White also does a good effort, but he does not get too far. a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown on films such as "The Good Girl" and "School of Rock"), so I would love to see that he was one of the screenwriters in this film instead of acting only on him . Liver Tyler suffers from the same situation of all of the above mentioned actors:. Smother's worst failure is absolutely boring and dysfunctional. His script is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations that I've seen on the site. Come away from this bad comedy.
