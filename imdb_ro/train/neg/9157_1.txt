Your first hint that this is a brown film is that it was shot on video, not on film. The story is convoluted, and production is amazingly negligent. Note, for example, that when the title couple is on a plane that appears to land in Vermont, where they left to celebrate their relationship at a civil ceremony, the plane is shown coming to an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a tropical garden, including palms, that would not last for five minutes in the New England climate. On another plane trip, the layout image describes a FedEx charge plane. Perhaps they could only afford to travel. As for the plot, this film awaits you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devoted Christian brother, is kicked out of his church when the congregation finds out that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor puts Victor with a man struck to kill Ben and Arthur "to cleanse their souls of sin." It seems that nobody in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it was not for Jamie Brett Gabel, which is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film would have no redeeming qualities at all.
