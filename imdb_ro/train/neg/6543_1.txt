The 1990s began to have daytime talk shows, to grow left and right. Each network had one, and all of this did not have one thing Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the tiring trailer park mama with a Marlboro cigarette that hangs from her mouth while feeding one of the dozens of illiterate teenage children. The English language and other cornerstones of mankind, where they are destroyed, show existence. Titles ranging from the Girl you have a pigeon head and so on. How can anyone see this garbage purely and totally? Did our society really become nothing more than a bunch of parents of hill hills and dead dead? The people who appeared in this show were the Trash. The people who watched this show were the Trash. Anyone wishing to see this re-performed or put on DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are becoming greasy and too fat to get jobs, having such shows to tell them that it is OK to overweight them by 500 pounds and 12-year-old girls act as prostitutes. Having such garbage on TV has ruined the morale.
