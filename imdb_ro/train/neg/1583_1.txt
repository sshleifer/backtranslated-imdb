I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I liked The Running Man. So obviously, I was very excited that somebody made a movie about it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was ready for a night of fun! The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone threw Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply can not believe that a man who has become famous for films filled with a "fire" could play a more cunning part, as described in the book. Still, I was convinced that this movie would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? Well, he did not. Soon I learned that the only reason he was voted for was that someone re-wrote the whole story to make him fight in a "fire." Yes, it was a standard film from Arnold: the hero is mistaken, the hero solves the problems by bending strong muscles and scaring everyone and the hero becomes the face. I was surprised. This is not what the book said. I know books can not be put on the screen literally, but this has not even had links to the book. Stephen King should have frankly denounced any affiliation with the film and should have forbidden the use of The Running Man for this shameless film loss. I'm not saying too often, but this movie was BAD. If I did not look at home, I would have tossed broken tomatoes to the screen. Again: bad. (Note that I used a lot of someone I did because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I do not want to do more to make them here)
