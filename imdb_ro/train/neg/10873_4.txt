Many people thought it was a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spacecraft crushed on the ground and some of the strangers escaped from the spacecraft, then killed some people on earth, but for no reason. It's also in a dark forest, I do not see anything on the screen, I barely listen to the sound. A few days later, the predator came to the ground, but no one had sent signals before that, he should not know what happened on the earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found the director of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He was not alive on earth, he did not deal with things here. Eventually, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not tell the storytellers clearly. To conclude, I do not think it's a good movie.
