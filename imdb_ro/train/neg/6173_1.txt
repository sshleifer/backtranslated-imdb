This movie is a blatant attempt by the Hollywood left to describe Reagan's administration as incompetent and bungling. There were mistakes during the crisis, but I'm sure not to the extent that it is presented in this tortured film. My first reaction was that the movie was to be directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others.
