Steve Carpenter can not make horror movies. First, pouring was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was Buffy the Vampire Slayer's hot hair hairdress. This film has no gore (usually a key ingredient for a horror movie), no action, no action, no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he's so dry and clear in that he's sad. There were some parts that should have been fun (continued horror / comedy) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought this movie was rated R, and I did not pay attention and I realized it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, you see this movie if you liked it, I still know what you did last summer. This is the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely. And seriously, this is for you Steve Carpenter, no longer horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
