This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie - so if you have not seen a movie and want to leave spoilers, please do not read this review! the film should be about the Christian encounter and Kathryn for the first time, the film is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors portrayed by Kathryn Christian Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar are indeed very weak substitutes. Nor can he pull from the dizzy, snooty rich-child attitude that the original actors did. It is absolutely horrible that some of the dialogues were verbal - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely, you will recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this was really the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, why did the Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He is supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). Also, the link with the photo / "You could be a model" end was total blades and did not add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe they have made intentional intentions 3.
