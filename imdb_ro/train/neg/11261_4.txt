To begin with, I must point out that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, something happens, but you do not know why or why. When you finally realize, you realize that there is nothing but a lost work, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegal sons ... Characters are pretty poor and actors (especially young people) does not help much to make a credible look. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a gorgeous actress, no matter if the movie is a pure garbage. The only positive things to say about "Frío Sol De Invierno" is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and shot some scenes that are quite intense ... Well maybe next time ... My rate: 4 / 10
