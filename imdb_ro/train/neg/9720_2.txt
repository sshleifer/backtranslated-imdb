This movie is just boring. Try to copy some effects borrowed by a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain," but it's too much. Dialogues are bad enough, some of the worst we've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost did not find him too convincing), his father plays very bad, the story is bad, the conclusion is ... I think I did not like a movie so much from "le pacte des loups" by Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year), but at least the film had some actions and a lot of good actors. I did not comment here (just rated), and when I saw the rating and comments, I thought I had to write something down. I think we will not have trouble selling the DVD they offered: not such a bad movie in our collection (great) !!! <br /> <br /> I opened my eyes (watching SF, western, drama, comedy, silence, horror, fantasy ... movies) but this movie was so boring that I felt I had lost an hour and half.
