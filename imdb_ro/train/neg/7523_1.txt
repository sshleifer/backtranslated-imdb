Once again, I took a chance and rented this bag of nonsense. Made like a horror blow, it was not a scene, not one that was even scary. NONE!! Of course there was nudity, but all the lesbian action has become a little old. I think it should have been the saving grace of this film? And Dan, what a bag! Right from the beginning I knew I was there when good Dan spoke the first time. And should it have been intimidating? What a laugh! Generally, this movie is terribly awful! How are movies like this? If you want a movie with some emotions in it, do not rent it. This movie is just as exciting as the Teletubbies.
