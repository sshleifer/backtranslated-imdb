the great mystery, but the movie comes down from here. The beginning is promising with a car and a woman and her daughter burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized over this and the popping pills are seen. A mysterious letter appears from an old girlfriend asking for help finding her missing daughter. So, Ed travels to a commune of the island, mainly for a woman. They do not like outsiders. A lot of stuffing is with Ed shown around the city for the girl. That made the movie too long. Finally, it gets a little better towards the end, when we learn about the crazy rituals the woman is doing and, ultimately, about the sinister plan for Edward. Generally, it's not a well written and too long story. <br /> <br /> VERDICT FINAL: I would ignore this.
