A fan dedicated to TLK movies, the first being a milestone, and the second, perhaps, Disney's best continued sequel, alongside this movie ... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice, music, but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwdriver in the TLK atmosphere. Though not bad, adds nothing. Basically, this movie is a big joke ... and that's all it saves. Make a true TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
