"A Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents," but it comes as if it had been edited up from the rest of the cameras to cut those two movies. Fortunately, I hired her for a 5 day rental because I could not stay and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where the other boys are automatically covering up Paul's pills (the save-mart checker was great), but the writing of the writings is absolutely horrible. Dialog goes down most of the time and only when you think things will eventually end up, an unconscious inconvenience is blocked for no good reason. How many jokes do you really need a movie? Do not get me wrong, good humor is great when it's done intelligently like in the other movies I've mentioned, but the movie loses only the sign. Too bad as I like Julia Stiles (The ten things I hate about you was great), but even that could not help me stay in this terrible movie. Save your money and rent "There is something about Mary" once again.
