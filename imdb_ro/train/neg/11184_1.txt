This is a really terrible movie. I only wrote this, so some people somewhere are stopped watching it. If I stopped a person from losing some of their precious life watching this movie, I would die happily. However, although Al Pacino is, I was fooled into thinking that at any moment it was something interesting to happen. Then the credits rolled and I realized I was completely tricked into seeing this incredible move. I can not believe that this movie got a score as high as IMDb (over 5 stars when we last saw the vote). Are you people who ironically vote? Please, please do not look at this movie!
