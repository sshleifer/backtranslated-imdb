This is the worst crackle imaginable. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very fun and dramatic. Producers of this worthless film do not follow him closely. Well, the old novels are not sacred, and making free versions of them is good with me if someone has their own ideas. If all that can be done is changing things and replacing them with uninteresting and wandering clich√©s, we should stick to the original. If he had made this film at least twice as good, even with worse actors, and filmed in a cardboard hut studio. There is no imagination just fatigue. This should be bought or watched only by Victorian novel collectors made in movies. Just a hint, and not a spoiler, to make those of you who read the novel understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch this on TV or - do not allow - to lose money to buy this. Gagool an old witch witch in the book and a precursor of Gollum was transformed into a beautiful horror!
