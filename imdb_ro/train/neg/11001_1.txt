I have never seen a comedy that turned out to be a very good thing to stand in front of ... not to laugh at it. Okay, maybe a little giggle for little Michael Clarke Duncan as the big, black gay maiden, cheala. But the rest was not funny. In addition to being laughed at all, "sketches" continue forever! Avoid this if you value your time and money. Afraid !!! The worst!!!
