I rarely thought about making an online commentary about a movie. But I do not understand how this has been done. Who did it? How could he think they would be able to make a feature film? He did a weekend school class, got a big check from his father and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to come in? Or was she, in any case, a long-standing family friend / a distant relationship, who did this out of goodness, welfare was missed? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he feels extremely embarrassed to be in it, mumbling his lines and hiding his face from the room. Meanwhile, the DOP must have been the gaffer from the Neighbors, it seemed like there was absolutely no sound, the script, the direction and the editing were all stupid and, frankly, the apathy that overwhelms me right now means it can not be disturbed to spend more much of my life thinking about this movie.
