Clean up in your favorite chair and start the play station as you throw it into the waste disposal unit. Spend a useful 90 minutes. enjoy your favorite game. Disjointed - junk filming unwanted. It takes bits from several science fiction movies and hard attempts to join the pieces in a poorly pathetic story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would do a monetary game, but it takes a touch of ingenuity and talent to turn it into a good movie. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and I personally want to return 90 minutes of life.
