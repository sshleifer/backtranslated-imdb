This was a disappointing film for me. He came to me through a set in a box titled "Classic Film Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually enjoy movies made in this style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre) . I do not think it's a noir movie. It seems that there is a tendency these days to label and market all Black and White B films made between 1947 and 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the action of the movie takes place inside. These are just the noir elements we could see. There is no ubiquitous paranoia, no real reason you should be sympathetic to Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overwhelmed and unconvincing as fatal females. I do not want to ruin this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested in hearing what other noir film connoisseurs know about it.
