This is the hardest love story I've ever had. The perfect film for a housewife in the office, in the jacket, in the house and in the high-heeled muscles to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating candy. In fact, sticks play a prominent role in the film. The only reason I was able to look at the end is that I finally managed to look at Keanu Reeves' dreamlike face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, who is waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as rigid as the wood. Unfortunately, the bodice is not broken - the hero is desperately perfect - mannered and easy. The clich√© family of the old family with aristocratic warm blood is as old as the hills. What if Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairytale story. I knew before the titles ended that it was not the movie we hoped for. Bright grapes looked like the line of all food ads in the Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his names listed, but the director of art was certainly Thomas Kinkade, who painted millions of dollars of fugitive Irish cabins. This film was literally seen through pink glasses. If you like pink and blue sky, this movie is for you! (The candies looked very good, too!)
