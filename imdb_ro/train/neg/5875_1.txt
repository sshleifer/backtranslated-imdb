This film deals with two former football players who are Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all sorts of ladies and men with a bad background. Mack Derringer is approached by former wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who is working on sex talks over the phone. Jennifer is threatened by a caller who wants to do something horrible and asks for help with some other ladies. Mack and Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl golf courses or spend a sporting bar in which all sorts of things happen in town. There is a lot of punches, murder and a lot of double-meaning words that bring this movie completely to a big ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
