I appreciate the need to hire strangers for such horror films, but at least have to hire some appropriate actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monoton at the bulldozer on every line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is not really a recognized plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other assorted languages ​​instead of proper dialogue . <br /> <br /> The story, as it is, is largely made up of a seemingly random gore and death with some valuable "surprises" that take place about 10 minutes after you see exactly what happens happens. Not only this, but there are more bullet holes and continuity errors (Why do I go there? Did not have a gun? Did not she die?) So make the entire movie look like she was being shot of the hours they would take to fix them. Another film that simply relies on blood and gore instead of real cinematic experience.
