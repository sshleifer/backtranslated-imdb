Easily, the most famous of all Shakespeare plays, was seriously abandoned here. A bold direction, stagnant work in studios and irregular performances spoils a fine tragedy. In the city of Verona, Caplets and Montagues have been feuding for centuries, but the tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Bloodshed soon bursts ... Work in the studio, especially during the days, seriously impedes the energy of the play. It's a story that, with her energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. Along with this, the costumes are terrible, with too many stockings and strange codings. The battle scene looks terrible, with too much stretch and running around to be hired. Patrick Ryecart is too easy to be a really effective Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the plot goes, but its imposing emphasis and gentle, often inexpressive eyes, limits the interval. It is very difficult for the public to refer to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she surprises the naivety of the character, but a little more sassiness would have been welcome. Support roles do not go much better. Joseph Laurence, Joseph O'Connor's brother, is fine, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Mercutio's Anthony Andrews is on the stage and not on the room. He scares and gesticulates excessively and therefore seems ridiculous. Alan Rickman, who understands his role, has virtually no presence like Tybalt. He has developed a margin and intensity to provide some fine screen performance in the years to come, but that's not proof here. The Prince can play a very good role in his short appearances, but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give up his authority on the room. Only Micheal Hordern, probably in the best part of this series, comes out of it with all dignity. His head is well played and a joy to watch. See one of the other versions of this story.
