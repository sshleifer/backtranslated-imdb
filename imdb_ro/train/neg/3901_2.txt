The script is beautiful. Though the casting is totally unobtrusive. Not style. Costumes do not look like some of High Highbury. By comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Mrs. Paltrow, although Mrs. Paltrow is the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mister. Northam is undoubtedly the best Knightley of all versions, it's romantic and not at all sharp and ruthless like Mr. Knightley in the TV version. The spectator can not see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. Developing the Smith relationship as it was in the motion version, so you can not understand where Emma was trying to make a Elton-Smith match (besides the portrait).
