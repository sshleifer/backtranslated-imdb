I could give 6 or 7 this propaganda film, because it shows when and how a propaganda film is successful. If there are people watching this play and think "well, then Jews must have done something to treat how they were treated in WW2," then the movie is very smart done to hide "why and how" and false remarks about how a people live. What more can you watch a propaganda film? The part that includes an American movie about the Rothschild family is re-used, for example, very cute here. The question of why the Jew keeps wealth away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the tax system within that social layer. In addition, the level of emotion (or level of disgust) in the movie grows slowly, and the end of the movie's purpose and the need to do propaganda. The public would leave with joy and gratitude in the times that come ... well done. In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the public. The film is a kind of today's story, so you do not have to really get a lot of excitement about it. However, in this simplicity of the words of ethnic degradation, a careful supervisor can find relevance for cultural hatred, violence, decivilization, and integration issues. In general, fine rubbish.
