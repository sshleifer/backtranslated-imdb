Drew Barrymore continues to see his alter-ego across the city and begins to become a pain in his ass. After Dee hired an apartment from a hacker, meetings with "the other Drew" more frequently. Writer-Dude feels it's his responsibility to hit the "real Drew" out of his stupor, so he does everything he can to help, including seduce her as soon as he has free time. It's not very interesting and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when he gives a finger to rude laborers ... yes, Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene could be if Drew spoils her mother, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
