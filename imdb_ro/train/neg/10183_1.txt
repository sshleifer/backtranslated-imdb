This is a very tough production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margareta could have been spoiled and pampered and could have found herself in the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful woman. Here was the weakest point in the production, the actress failed to get it. It also appeared that the production budget could not extend to a hairdresser - from the very beginning Princess Margarete's hair had a permanently disoriented bird's nest and seemed to have been dragged through a bush. The actor who sang the duke of Edinburgh seemed to prepare for his role, seeing Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and it was a farcical. Production was a disturbing, disturbing and disturbing load of garbage. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
