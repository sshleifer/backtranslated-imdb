When I read the back of the DVD box, I thought it sounded very interesting ... so ... I had my mother throw it into the movie pile of the "4 for $ 20" section of at Blockbuster. When we got home and appeared in the movie ... twenty minutes ago, we found ourselves returning to each other by going "this is a thought ... Let's put something else too." I admit, some of the lines from our friends at the caf√© made us smile a little. But come, at least you get some decent actors! From time to time, in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie does not go at a painfully slow pace and actually looks interesting, I can do it and laugh a few laughter as they passed (or under ) make their lines. But I can only take that much. The scenic plates showed the actors had hysterical baits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines ... the amateurs did not even approach the actor in this movie. Anyone who came here saying that this movie was good should have been on some really good drugs while watching the movie. It is the most useless thing I ever had the discontent to look at. DO NOT SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
