First of all, I have no idea how this movie made on the big screen. It's not even a movie with low-budget SCI-Fi channels, it's just terrible. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. they went to see the movie waiting for me this film to a Dragons Transformers and mindless entertainment. All I got was an hour and a half without a mind. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so terrible, along with acting, she did. In principle, a Dragon Chinese who returns every 500 years ... Does it sound like a good remake of the fire? No, the plot is trying to be deeper than it should leave not only plot holes, but magic and a very small real war between dragons (pretty big snakes) just becomes ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor to the failed film. My friend and I laughed the whole thing (along with the 5 publics) and I did not think I spent money on that. The short trailer on the TV makes for most of the action, while the rest becomes debris. I have seen a lot of B movies, such as Reptilian, Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want a laugh non-stop for an hour, watch this. / 10 CG: 5/10 Action: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but would have helped before watching this movie
