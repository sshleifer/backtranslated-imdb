Written by excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. He spent a lot of time creating Hovis' atmosphere and laughing at Catholic requirements. Then, very quickly, you have the fascist and socialists who are struggling for the family's attention and the terrible ending. But my wife believed that Liam was cute.
