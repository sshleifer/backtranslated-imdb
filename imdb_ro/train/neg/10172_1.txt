When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was eager to see the movie. And I have to say that the first fifteen minutes have been nostalgic in a way. Then he walked all over the hill. I did not expect this to be a pile of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo. They took all the controversial issues and threw him into a stupid story. I was frightened by the fact that Noah was involved in this, especially his role. Nobody with a fully functioning brain would actually accept all the crap about the Vietnam War. If someone really wants to know what communism is, sit down and read a book about him. And not one who praises him or is against him, only the cold hard facts. I just watched some scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all I cared about. Everything else about this movie irritated me.
