Hollywood does it again. A lot of money without creativity. I'm sure the writers were something other than oxygen when they wrote that. Based on the previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you are not in the last stupid pop culture, then you will lose most of the stupid humor in this movie. Why you waste your time. You can put yourself in a diary without doing anything and have more fun than this movie will give you. <br /> <br />
