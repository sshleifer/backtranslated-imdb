The Incredible Melting Man plays as an extended episode by The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and nudity. I know this movie is a little boring, but I realized it was impossible not to like it. The act and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year film with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a long time to melt, but when doing so is reasonably impressive; we also have an invented death scene that involves electric shock. It is also noteworthy music, it is crazy - a mixture of cheese-tastic nonsense. <br /> <br /> Wonderful highlights: <br /> <br /> * Marvel at the slow-moving nurse that jumps through a glass panel for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed for a day in the life of an overturned head. Beware of the humanoid melted by psychotic cannibalism. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed when our hero takes a break from the hunters who melt to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient biscuits in the kitchen. it's too much for me to hate him. It's hard to handle, but I thought it was really fun. You could do much worse.
