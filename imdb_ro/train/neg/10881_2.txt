My friend's mother worked at a movie store and watched movies before going out, so when I brought home to The Convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to watch her. Since it should be frightening, but it is actually hilarious, I can say that, in a strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the act is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so funny! "WHAT DO YOU DO CA-RACK?" I did not know this movie was ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... Yeah, so ... in general, the movie is bad enough (you have to admit so much at least) , but I promise you, you get a good laugh out of it. * this movie is a shit, but it's good for a laugh ... especially the guy who owns the "dagger of despair". THE DAGGER DESPAAAAAAIR!
