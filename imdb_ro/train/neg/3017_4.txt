Now I had the best intentions when I looked at it. I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even if I heard other people else. But that was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott is trying too hard. Everything was too much. Allow me to work out. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was defeated, not in a good way. People who had good performances were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their time on the screen did not save the movie. <br /> <br /> There have been some scenes that have jumped in their originality, but somehow they felt as if they were written by someone other than the main writer. A certain song was used around 4 times, which began to appear after the second time. I am a firm believer not to use the same song several times. <br /> <br /> Also, editing really came out on this because the cutting rate is quite high. Oh, and the repetitive echoes of some of Keira's lines just called cheese after they heard it for the second, third, fourth, and so on. Practically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-move that is high-speed and "somewhat" funny and you do not care about all that I mentioned above, you like it. <br /> <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
