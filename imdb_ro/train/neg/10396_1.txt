Being a single director, having a slightly dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was sad when I took home "Wrongs ..." (not that the cover of the DVD gave something, preferring instead the ambiguity quoted by the director controversial, Chris Morris, "a short film that includes scenes"). I should have known better and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle. The scene in the church is reluctant to look (especially because we are too familiar with Morris' deformed attitude to pedophilia in his notorious series, Brass Eye) and has no purpose but to shock. How this movie is labeled as a comedy I will never understand. The runner's comment seems to be an idea in principle (being a runner myself, it is often an interesting and unobstructed perspective on the filming process). however, this is unfortunately not the case here. On the contrary, we are treated with a certain school pupil playing dogs on the film, before concluding that there are no really wonderful dogs movies. This is very interesting, but it does not deserve a single celluloid frame. To say that this movie is not going anywhere would be an understatement. It relies too much on its enhanced style, to the detriment of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unfulfilled. His simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is so obvious and poorly illustrated. The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately fails to persuade, to entertain, to light and to become irritating. If you want to see a really big piece, I strongly recommend "The wonderful life of Franz Kafka" by Peter Capaldi.
