This is the kind of movie so bad that you can not watch it because you continue to say that "it can not continue to be so crushed to the end." Just cant "You know," worse than Jaws 4 " I think we honestly saw only a movie that was worse than that, and then we talk about religious nonsense about how you "end up in hell for lying or watching football. Gore? Indeed a lot of it. Gore well done? No way. The actor is beyond harm and all the lines are unpleasant clich√©s. The same thing happens to the story that really consists of sex, blood and violence, just like many other gore films. If you scared for a mix between Ichi Killer and Underground August? continue looking. You will not find it in Live Feed.
