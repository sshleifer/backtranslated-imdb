I saw the movie accidentally yesterday at a cinema. I had some hopes for the movie, because I like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The movie starts fine, because at first it seems to be a beautiful thriller. Although the film becomes a misery with non-interest lines, characters that are never hardened and no one in the audience they care for (such as Marjoke) and terrible editing. The film fades into black fragments that are too long, a tangled timeline that jumps back and forth and a lot of scenes that add nothing to the story and could have been easily abandoned. After you have suffered through the story, you will be treated to one of the toughest endings that I have seen a lot. It should also be noted that the film has a lot of explicit sexual scenes that you will probably use if you watch a lot of Dutch films. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. About one-third of the audience had already left the theater halfway through the movie and did not hear a word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at any cost. has really destroyed any belief we had in the film industry in the Netherlands.
