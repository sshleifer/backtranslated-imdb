I was attracted by the title ... I was expecting an inspirational and exciting journey into alcoholism, but I have a pretty boring and inanimate story about a lame laugh. The main character is not much given psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify poetry as adolescence as psychology. It was a shame because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to describe the inner feelings of a man who had had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be rather: "I am as I am because it is me." And the bad attempt to give a certain poetic edge to a lower class man makes things even worse. Returning to the overclaimed cliché of "poète maudit" recurrences of quick repair, an inexpensive way to make a dull movie seems smart, artistic and meaningful. But "16 years of alcohol" is not much intelligent, artistic or meaningful ... The main character does not evolve at all, and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt was made in blue. The film borrows a lot from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately fails to regain their grandeur even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, giving us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but insipid to the brain.
