This movie makes mistakes. a few American actors in Spain, and Spanish actors speaking English. English "spanish" is OK, but the way in which the act is done makes everything annoying. dialogue across the scenario is very poor; maybe it was a Spanish script but incorrectly translated, who knows and cares. I can only assume that they are famous Spanish actors forced into English, they can be good, but not on this flop. you will find the movie in the first 5 minutes, that's how pathetic it is. then the rest is just bad. a lot of time losses, a lot of UN plots required. I said that one of those in Baldwin is in this.
