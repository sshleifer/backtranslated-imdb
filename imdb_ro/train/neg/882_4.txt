There is a reason why this went directly to the film - the story is camouflaged, Nick Cage interprets Johnny in the wrong way - sex in churches, and other scenes that surround the tasteless (such as the scene from the laundry) harms this movie. Judge Reinhold is all right, but the movie itself, with degradation and revenge, is not well done. But it is a good movie for trivia contests - because so few people have seen it.
