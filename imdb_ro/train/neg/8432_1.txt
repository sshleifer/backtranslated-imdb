Let the genius like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to persuade his country's supporters to subsidize this wrong trial of a movie. The sad state of the film industry in the country is a product of trying to make a film of such a thin material. Most of the photos taken in Spain fall into two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, who like to present the past history that writers consider fit. The other type of movies shows the spectator with a lot of free sex because the "creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> As the movie opens, we look at Pere's penis as he tries to cut it off and place it in one of the party plates. Later, Sandra will show everything he has been given to the public to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happy married, is false from the start. Our only interest in watching the film was centered on an earlier picture, better done by Mr Pons, Amic / Amat, but unfortunately has nothing to do with the misery we are being punished to pursue this adventure. As for the comments sent in IMDb, all negative votes come from Spanish spectators, who speak volumes coming from them!
