Howling II (1985) was a total of 180 from the first film. While the first movie was campy and creepy. The second was crazy and cheesy. The production values ​​on this issue are rather bad and the action is atrocious. The third-party anchorwoman's brother wants to find out what happened to his sister. The "scene" of the first movie was re-created wrong. A poor, looking woman accompanies her brother (Reb Brown) in the old country (Romania) to discover the mystery of her sister's killing / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears now and then as a kind of wise / guide for the two. Sybil Danning and his two greatest assets appear as Stirba, the headwoman of Romania's head. Also, suffer from a bad morning case, ewww! <br /> <br /> The film is bad. There's nothing good about this stoner. I am surprised that Philippe Mora has directed this image because he is usually a good filmmaker. The movie is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (not content, it's the movie itself). To browse the movie, you get a "punk" interpretation from a Babylon "Damn" Babylon. Perhaps if he had overcome a few extra dollars, he could have got a real deal instead of an imitation. Best to avoid if you are not desperate or lost your remote and you are too lazy to change the channel.
