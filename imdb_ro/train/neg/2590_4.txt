American Pie has gone a long way from the first. At first, I think the actors have no idea what they are doing, and in return it's just a remake of a party college going nuts. The story sets two freshwater college boys (with the young soulmaker) to see the dreams of going to college just to experience late night parties, sex and, of course, the drink. The plot is bad and comes away from the original pie. In fact, they did not show an apple pie somewhere in the movie. Fortunately, I work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember that it's a waste of time if you do not enjoy sex-free sex videos with absolute nudity and crazy drink. I'm a teenager, and I think even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice.
