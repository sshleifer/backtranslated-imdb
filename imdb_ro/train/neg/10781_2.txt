In fact, it has never been. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a screw comedy from the 1940s. What is useless to delete! None of these people are approaching a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, today's public is not so responsive to this mild bite. Writing is trivial. The terrain is thin and obvious. The chemistry of the main characters is nonexistent. It's interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think it's a reincarnation of a great star from the "Hollywood Golden Age" whenever it is. It's an effect he's trying and fails to touch again with Richard Gere in the Runaway bride.
