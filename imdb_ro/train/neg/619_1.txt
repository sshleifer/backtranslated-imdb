WOW is all I can say if your reading is either viewed or thinking about it. believe me to watch the clock! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard in so many parts of this movie, the worst act ever made is very funny! I can not believe they overlapped the school sign! I've probably played that scene all the time to laugh more and more every time. If such a movie can be done, it gives us all the hope to make our own films. even the costume was bad. it seems that my 7-year-old cousin could have done a better job doing that. I know he could write and act better. all I know is that I have to look at the second part just to see if it was as bad as the first. a wonderful idea about a killer scarecrow, but much better work could have been done. we hope another movie will come out of killer scarecrows, just not like this one.
