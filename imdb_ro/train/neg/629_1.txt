I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so good they are good. A ninja scarecrow who creates wisdom and can put corn cobs as a lethal weapon ... surely fits this "budget for brilliance" system. The depth of the movie is surely its force, and the twists and movements that it implements by holding the audience at the edges of the seats really lead the terrible ... ninja ... adolescent ... a thirty-year-old student ... drawing non-cowboy ... wise break ... female scarecrow in the spotlight as the weirdest horror icon of the year. All I can say is "you can dig it" and recommend you watch movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy such hilarious horror. (WHAT THEY HAVE LOVED!
