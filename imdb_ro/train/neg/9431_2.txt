The premiere of the basic film for slasher, 3 young ladies destroy their car and end up with a gruesome family. Yawn. Watching 36 minutes from a premonition of OJ's search with a white sedan instead of a bronco. Yawn. The old lady with hot and cold dementia who controls her daughter ... YAWN 23 minutes to watch the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the hell ate ... OK, it could be a drinking game here ... Nope - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free showering scenes ... OK took my interest for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Complete random and uninspired choices ... YAWN <br /> <br /> Conclusion ... Dude! that psycho is disturbed - why could not the rest of the movie be like in the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately, that is my - my advice - goes quickly in the last five minutes and watch this and then put something good in the player - for I'm going back to bed.
