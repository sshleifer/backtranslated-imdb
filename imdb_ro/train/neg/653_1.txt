If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in the minus. While respecting the fact that someone has to continue doing these terrible horror movies seriously, people buy a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more worthwhile . Despite the fact that it's a horror movie, there's nothing scary besides that, unless you scare the idea of ​​seeing how many horror clips fit into a movie. If the rating was higher, it probably would have done for a better movie in the long run. Whoever made this version of "Prom Night" was wrong. The actors should probably have done a decent job if it were not the questionable scriptures. It was a terrible waste of a cinematic journey. I'd have to see again "Lost Call" again, at least having a plot.
