I actually took this movie because I saw Kitato Takashi's brilliant remake from Zatoichi and I had a mood for another updated samurai story that also played Asano Tadanobu. These two films are separate worlds. Zatoichi brought humor and depth to his characters and pointed out traditional samurai clich√©s. Gojoe goes from the other end in the opposite direction. First of all, I hate films that have other characters, inform the public about the main character instead of having the character developed throughout the movie. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character from Benkei's presence, yet this inner disorder is barely conveyed inside the character himself. Instead of developing the character, we will get scenes full of beatings, boring and fighting. Asano's character is undeveloped and even seems to get bored and does not know what he's doing there. I know he usually looks distant and cool and is part of Asano's appeal, but this film does not serve him. Much of the room movement is nausea. There is a scene that unfolds forever when the camera turns around the main characters until my wife and I have vomited. The conclusion is ridiculous and rather anticlimatic. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that really good samurai movies are not made in Japan these days with this type of budget. The colors, the decorations and the costumes were wonderful, but the rest is just a waste of time. I would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
