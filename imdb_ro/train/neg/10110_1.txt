This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I do not even joke. It was stupid and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together. The case in which the film has entered is certainly a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie in the front of the box. Apparently, the director or make-up artist just put the black eyeglasses under his eyes and called them a zombie. The credits at the beginning of the film occupy almost 20 minutes of the film. What was watching the credits was the best part of the movie. It was a terrible movie and I could not believe how badly it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes u were like "what's going on?" The sound was terrible, and the action strikes looked like a teenage joke around to make a fake battle scene. If you think about renting or buying this movie I would advise you to look at at least the trailer because it shows how horrible it really is. I would have wanted to have followed her before hiring me.
