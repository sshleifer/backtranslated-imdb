I was raised by watching the original version of the Batman Animated series, and I'm a Roman animated collector Batman. With a cartoon hero, as iconic as Batman, there are certain traits that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are good and good, but when it completely changes character, it is too far away. I bought one of the "The Batman" seasons in the hope that an extra bonus feature could shed light on the creator's reasoning to make this show such an atrocity. In an interview by The Batman, one of the artists or writers (I do not know who) said that "we felt we should not get involved with Batman, but we could eat the villains." So they made the Joker a little immature baby, asking for his attention, the Penguin in an anime knockoff, Mr. Freeze in a jeweler thief, Poison Ivy in a hippie teenager and countless other shameful acts that do Bob Kane was rolling in the grave. <br /> <br /> To summarize everything: I would like to have more hands, so I was able to give this show FOUR FEDE. Squeezes through my 2 out of 10 rating simply because she uses Batman's name. Warner Bros. ... rethinks it! Please!
