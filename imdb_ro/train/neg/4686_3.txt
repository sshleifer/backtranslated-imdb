They were good performers by Robin Williams and others, but the movie was boring overall and very disappointing compared to positive reviews. I thought Sy could become a serial killer that makes people die: Ugly clothes traced its victims around food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting the medical history until they asked him to shoot them. I think the film is mostly addressed to egomaniacs who think foreigners are interested in their photos. I expect most retail workers to want a break from their customers.
