Bollywood fans keep the Amitabh Bachan's Mard pretty much, but I think he's very overrated. Manmohan Desai has previously collaborated with such films as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie and I have seen all those who liked it, so I waited a long time before watching Mard and I he was disappointed bitterly. My main concern about Mard is that it resembles Amar Akbar Anthony, part 2, maybe Mr. Desai has run away from ideas after using this formula for years and years. 1. First, several members of the cast are repeating from AAA, for example the police inspector who brings Amar, the Muslim who brings Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few others. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses sight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. After seeing the AAA over 1000 times I noticed that immediately. My other shit is that some situations just seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai has left the brain as much as the door, but with Mard I thought it went too far. My last gripe is that, compared to the previous Manmohan Desai songs, I found the songs pretty disappointing. I know she has a lot of fans swearing through her, but I did not like it a bit. It prevents me from writing this review because I'm a huge fan and I loved the movies since I was a kid.
