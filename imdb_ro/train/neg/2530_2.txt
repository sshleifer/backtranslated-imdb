This movie was great. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First of all, the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is happening with this van love. In reality, the plot is: the boy wants sex, he buys a truck (which, in fairness is quite cool). Incredibly, given that he looks like a bassoon, he scorches with a lot of chickens! And he does not succeed with some. Then he scores with a really hot chicken and realizes that he loves that duddy bird who played hard to get. Then he races with his hot chicken friend. And he ends his truck. At this moment danny devito saves the day. Although he did not need it, because in the tip of the wagon, the ginger kid had first crossed the line. I gave this 2 *, because I am willing to assume that there is a 70-year Vanning subculture that I do not receive, and also because there is a 70-year-old bullshit.
