And it falls into the "wonderful bad" category - that is a student boy movie would rent to get a kick out of. I was at the SF film festival and all I remember is a wave after a hysterical laugh wave that this movie premiered. Other critics will better describe the fecal nature of this film, and I felt so bad to the poor guy from the production company who has obviously returned to measure the public's reaction. What she got was the equivalent of a drunk student's science and an "serious" anime movie, I think it was "blue," the audience was in a state of drowsiness, and then this movie was opened and in a few seconds, everyone in the room they were rolling in the islands. I will beat the worst point; <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this film is scattered on a straightforward and predictable road on the wrong side. Waste, but ridiculously ridiculous. Animation: Very well done and put together, if you can make a bad background and the expensive costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), Then take care of the assembly in which she "draws" from a Swedish peasant girl in LADY DEATH ! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensionally painful, there is a short backstory (with side-by-side dialogue lines) and little light shines on the real motivation behind some of the main characters. So, briefly, if you have a captive audience and a few drinks around (try to make sure you're an alcoholic to relieve pain), then slide this movie on DVD and enter a "mystery theater 3000" mentality. There is no other motivation to watch this movie than to laugh at it, and it was not meant to be a comedy, DO NOT HIDE TO DO THE ONE MOVIE. It might be even more boring to watch solo than the "New World" with Colin Farrell, because you will not be able to laugh ridiculously with a friend or two.
