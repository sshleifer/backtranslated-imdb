And that comes from someone who will resist almost any viewing. The actor and the sound are terrible. This can qualify for a merit point "so bad is good" for some. However, I take my horror movies seriously, and that's just stupid - it's just so cheap, I think it's my major complaint. Dialogue is often hilarious - the attention of how many times you "scared me" is used. The "child" actress is seriously terrible god - I pray that an acting career has ended here. The "DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS" line is worth to see repeatedly.
