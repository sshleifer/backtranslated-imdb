The box for "To Die" brought me in - a guy without a shirt and the promise of laughter and sex. It was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is light on the eyes but does not laugh and evil sex. Young, Mark, and Simon have been together for a few years, but no character is interesting enough to care for them, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. Guilt seems to be in the scenario, not in shows; both actors do everything they can with what they are given. <br /> <br /> The end is sappy and unaffected (well, not completely unaffected, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about homosexual relationships and AIDS, which is funny, "Party Parts" are much better.
