This movie is not funny. It simply takes the D & D stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30 kilograms a year, all live together with their parents, are socially retarded, and have no luck with women. Banknotes are horrible and unimaginable, such as two players who were beaten by a black leg because one of them had a hood that KKK was looking for (his wizard's suit) and the other guy chilled with John Rocker (oh how funny, he's a nerd, so he does not know about sports). Maybe you have to be childish to find something funny. The miserable workers are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to do. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only opportunities available for travels abroad.
