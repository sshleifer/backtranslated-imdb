If you are not petrified by the Russian people or boars, this movie is the most snorefest. Actually, I slept for about 40 minutes and had to fight the need to leave the theater. I'd like to have. A waste of a perfect evening Sunday afternoon. Even "Silent Hill" was more frightening. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was more frightening. I still do not know what should be scary in this move. First of all, I'm very lazy of movies that use "Russian pidgin", as it did in the opening credits. I'm embarrassing because I brought a group of my Russian friends and I all gave in. Dear good. Dear good. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you), this movie has already lost my brain and I just got out of it an hour ago. So, I have no specificity, just unshakable visions that go nowhere and some hopes that are now shaking - dead - that something would happen. Perhaps I have seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe we have received such great reviews here (that's why I have seen it) and have become so completely devoid of horror or suspense, but also of the total value of entertainment. I fell asleep and I wanted to go after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
