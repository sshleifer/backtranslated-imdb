The wicked man, with Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good film, but I can not really say that it's regretting me to forget. I could go on about the negative aspects of the movie, such as dreadful scenes and long scenes where Cage is looking for a girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence - with a hallucination, etc., but it is not worth it let's talk about a movie like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, even if it is bad: 5. It's hard to deny it has really horrible ideas, the only problem being in its weird execution , unintentionally funny. If not, this is a movie that can inspire you to see the original movie from 1973 or even read the unexpected story on which it relies. <br /> <br /> 4. For a horror / thriller of cheese, it is really aesthetically pleasing. It is quite obvious that it was filmed on the site, instead of using green screens or elaborate sets, so we came to see great landscapes. There are also many beautiful pictures. It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor, for it is a force of nature. Whether you are a fan or not, it seems that it is impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always a kind of eccentricity or nerudity that brings to the characters they play and, personally, I'm always fascinated by watching him in any movie he's doing. If Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his own unique energy into the game and it's never boring to look. It's terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could have written a movie about this movie because it seems to be the most powerful anti-feminist film ever made. "See?" you could write, "this happens when women are allowed to lead a society!" Also, the similarities between this "Summersisle" society and a bee colony are quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read this, it's probably a good chance to have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" in the movie, including Cage running in a costume Bears and, of course, "AAGHH! Line: These scenes are hilarious from the context and are still pretty funny while watching them in the whole movie." I bought the Blockbuster DVD for about $ 5 ... when you work this, it's a pretty good deal.NOTE: The unrated movie version is the best to watch and it's best to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on the epilogue that has a cameo from James Franco.
