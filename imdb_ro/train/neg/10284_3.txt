After seeing the men behind the Sun, I think we were hoping for an evolution in style and technique to fit the bigger scale of this film. I was also quite interested in seeing someone make a fictional account of what happened during this most notorious Japanese atrocities, but that's not. It behaves like a European Nazi exploitation film from the early seventies - for example, SS Experiment Camp etc (probably more like the women deported from the special section actually). Granted that it has a wider sphere of action and that more people are moving around it, but it resorts to the same cheap and unpretentious device of many countless unfortunate people, who often fall into the sound of flames of fire, accompanied by "shock "sequence. The often horrific documentary film is divided between such disturbing scenes that even these real images are stolen by much of their power. Watch Channel 4 (recently broadcast (still broadcast?), Starting 1 No 2006) for a really disturbing documentary documentary about the evil of the war (which has an excellent use of images in the context). This is the type of treatment that the awesome Nanjing deserves, not this unlucky exploitation trap (a better exploited exploitation film minus the unsuccessful use of stock images would have been good, but again this is not even a very good exploitation film). Rating: 3 (5 as a exploitation, 1 as a treatment for the subject).
