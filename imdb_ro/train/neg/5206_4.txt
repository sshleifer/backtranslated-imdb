Adapting plays to cinema is often a bad idea because they are two different environments. Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU a stage play? Imagine if two waves rescue dresses sit in a tent finding "Blimey are thousands of them out there" Great movie and a bad scene game Because a scenic game to make a big cinema needs two things Essential </ b> <br /> 1) A fine cast that creates chemistry on screen <br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> On Cher paper and Chazz Palminterri would be a good choice casting but not in these roles. The story revolves around a successful man played by Palminterri who enters a house to kill a wife played by Cher, with most of the action going on inside the house. I could not take those two characters seriously, though it was probably the scenario that can not decide if she was trying to be serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is extremely important for the dialogue to shine, and again, because of the bizarre tone of the script, it is more than anything else, with much conversation that revolves around sexual acts. if you want to see an excellent translation of a theater piece transferred to the silver screen, give the FAITH a wish and watch 12 ANGRY MEN
