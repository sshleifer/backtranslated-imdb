This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Except for some chuckles and one or two gore scenes, this film is a complete loss of time. Calling Campy does not even cut it. "Campy" involves fun that this movie was not. I'm going to spend the first half of the movie thinking "It's got to improve, is not it?" Correctly, by the end of the time when he finally explained who the brother / sister is and what he wants, but until then you do not take care, because you spent the entire half of the movie asking yourself exactly what Mr. Onorati & Mrs. Pacula has begun to beat someone from now to be stuck in such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
