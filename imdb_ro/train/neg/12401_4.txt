I'm in a distinct disadvantage here. I did not see the first two films in this series, although I've seen many of Larry Cohen's films. The fans of the series seem to think it's a good movie. Judging on her own, it was pretty boring. You never have a real look at the policeman's face (Robert Z'Dar), but what we saw was quite bleak. Dead scenes seem to be organized to eat the most, not to give emotions. Perhaps if I saw the NC-17 Director Cut, I might be more impressed. Ending with the tracking machine with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. the best part of the movie.
