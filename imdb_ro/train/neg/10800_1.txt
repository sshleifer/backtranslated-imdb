What was the purpose of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can not act, people do not know to direct and I am Kazaam! A cute kidnapper? Come on. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this one. I remember looking at this to kill the time. I did not really care. I remember thinking "who put Shaq in this movie?" The whole story seemed simple. It made no sense. I think an unrealized morality of this film is that you can find something in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so terrible that nothing worth commenting on. I want this movie to disappear.
