Spike Lee must be one of the best executives I've ever seen. He is dear to the critic because he is supposed to make films with a "message" or is just as bohemian in his approach as to make critics who are soaked in movies in Hollywood movies to eat their stuff just to be different. /> Summer Of Sam does not do that well. Cinematographic and editing style is Oliver Stone, so is the narrative. The plot is very similar to "Do not do good". The representation of Guidos or the set of Italian-American PCs (which happens to be one) is directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian macho type who is fighting a higher African American is much more credible than the Italian cartoon cartoons drawn here (the character of John Leguizamo being an exceptional possibility). <br /> <br /> There is someone who has seen this movie that could not figure out how it will end? As soon as Richie entered the movie, I saw his fist in front and his leg in his stomach, seeing him already being accused of being the killer. This character had the greatest integrity in the whole movie, so of course Lee will show what happens to people who notice in a crowd (what a clique a white beard!) Someone please please give it Spike Lee has a lifetime for all the basketball games he wants. So maybe he will enjoy too much to pick up a movie camera for a long time and we will not have to be subjected to a great self-esteem and, moreover, I will not have to see the critics (some of they respect) ohhhh and ahhhh of a king without clothes.
