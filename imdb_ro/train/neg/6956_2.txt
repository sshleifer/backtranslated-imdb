I'm sorry, but every time I see a movie where a sneaking woman - gives a man and man does nothing but cock, the film loses all credibility. So the new (feminine) Starbuck immediately ruined the plot before it collapsed even out of the ground. Dirk Benedict was far more plausible than the sensitive-than-old hero, Kattee Sackhoff - whose overlapping would probably be praised as "a convincing, exciting performance, you must see it", the correct new-talk policy today's copy review publishers; but, in essence, it's just an old tired picture of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a house: the biggest clich√© on the screens today. I could give more to this series, but only human cartoons will not keep me up to date. As James Hilton was once somewhat frightened: "A story, please give me a story."
