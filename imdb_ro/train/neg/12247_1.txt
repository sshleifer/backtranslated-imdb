This movie is very terrible. terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. The act was not convincing. It's a crocodile that attacks a tourists while filming a documentary about "surfing the blood." The surge of blood is when it sails around the sharks, but it turns terribly wrong when a crocodile 31 foot stops there feast. Sharks do not seem real. The crocodile is even worse and becomes more pathetic when it escapes from the creature, but the crocodile is blocked and the 2 females light it. Deaths are false and pirates are just to fill in time. A useless, terrible movie that is not worth watching!
