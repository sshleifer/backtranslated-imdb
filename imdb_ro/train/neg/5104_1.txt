What happened to the actors who took part in these crap? Michael Dorn should stay on the Star Treck goods. John Diehl, does anyone remember in Miami Vice? I enjoyed it there ... Well, anything - what can you expect from a movie with one of the baywatch rescuers at the head? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters is really nice, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a joke (very bad). There is no logic for what is happening. I had the feeling that the filmmakers were trying out a kind of "killer tomato attack". Especially where all important people were discussing national security in some sort of cabinet ... If you happen to watch it on TV, switch channels - your TV will ever be grateful.
