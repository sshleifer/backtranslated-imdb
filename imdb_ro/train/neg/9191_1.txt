Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write the review right after I saw this pond. Why? Because I have to tell everyone how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. Just to let you know how bad it is, I'll give you this little detail about the movie. During the chaos scenes, which usually consist of people who shoot or hit the zombies, they intercept scenes from the video game. Yeah, you heard me well. This movie sucks. In fact, it makes me think that it costs ten dollars these days just to enter the theaters of today. And see that bullshit? There is no story about where to talk, and the movie has nothing to offer besides occasional shooting and cheap killing. I'm very disappointed with this, knowing I looked at it. Okay, I'm stupid. It's so bad I can not even find the words. RATING: ZERO of *****.
