I'm a fan of arty movies, but I regret to report this movie to be pretentious. Agonizing slowly to develop an inexistent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, we will say, trying. Even after bad movies, I feel like learning something or enjoying something, but there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie begins and ends there. The actress was fine, although the characters were very dull. For the protagonist to move towards such a goal, he is strongly naked. Mercy. I usually enjoy movies that are informal, but the lack of the formula should not be confused with zero content.
