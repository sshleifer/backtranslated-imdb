I do not even know where to start this. It's family. This must be the most serious line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie, although this movie could not be a horror movie even if it tried !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing a type of chips that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man co-wrote "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stay on indie films. It's not happening here. Eventually, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no place to act legitimately for it. I am serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
