I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I'll go to any movie to see what's what took me to the Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and extremely slow. Because the movie seems to have been shot with a hand-held room, important parts of it do not focus. <br /> <br /> The film has a very small dialogue and what does not tell you too much. There are endless scenes of people just sitting around cigarettes smoked or sitting in a room looking at each other without conversation. The way the movie is changed is also very confusing and hard to follow. Even after reading a series of reviews beforehand and having a general idea of ​​what it was about the film, we still had a hard time understanding what was happening. <br /> <br /> I knew earlier that the movie was not as old as Ziyi Zhang earlier, but he was looking forward to seeing it in something different, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. He never smiles in this movie, though he often has no reason to smile. I could have done without sex scenes because they were pretty much like sex and no obvious feelings among the participants as you could find them.
