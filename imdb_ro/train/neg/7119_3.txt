* SPOILERS * I'm sure back when it was released in 1958 it was very appropriate for its time. At that time, the films moved more slowly to allow the public to trace and analyze the story. Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife who died mysteriously with his new wife. Mickey gardener (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) is indeed an underrated character. She has a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she has problems, since she knew there was an illegal game in the death of her first wife. She can not tell Jenni what happened, so she's trying to scare her with the skull. Jenni, I also learned that she saw her parents dead, causing a life of mental suffering that leads to institutionalization. Like many publications today, I realized that pacing is too slow for my tastes. But if you like horror with slow rhythm, without too much gore, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
