Many fans of the king hate this because they have left the book, but the film is a different medium and the books should change when they make the jump. In spite of this, the film fails completely, but fails entirely on the terms of the film. I'd like to rip people who tell me it's the most frightening movie ever made. I have always continued with the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I asked, she was silent. Occasionally, someone, at a loss for a decent scarecrow (There is none ...), calls the grape "grape juice-pull-out-of-elevators". If you are afraid of this, I do not know what to say, except you may be easily scared. I just breathed my eyes, looking at these horror ideas of type Z, playing in this incoherent film and an unconscious film. A place that removes the book and is really insipid is the tedious work of the movie, Halloran to Overlook just to kill him; the worst member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor to take Halloran FOREVER to go down. Really one of the stupidest sequences he ever put on the film. <br /> <br /> A delightful choice for Halloran Stanley's artwork! Afro-nymphomaniacs of black light really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a "farther" shot in any movie ever made? I think it is a miracle that I eventually managed to bypass it and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a really important film, given the immense "bad will" generated by this stupid and stupid film, as well as the worship of some old fanatics of Kubrick, who could not describe an idea at work with her, the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Discover Jack Nicholson's grotesque captivity, the introduction of tense moments at tense moments and the performance of Razzie by Shelly Duvall and you have a very bad movie.
