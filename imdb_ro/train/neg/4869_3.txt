This film has not been able to explore the animal world that left me feeling empty inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up the big deal to help his blond friends. While Babe (the original) hit the big-budget blow trend, focusing on human animal virtues to their human counterparts, all the animals in this movie were just comic caricatures that someone (especially if you could understand their useless use). Without Eddie Murphy's tumultuous behavior, this movie would be a flop.
