Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about him, you are a better person than me! This film, while a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy by appearance, sound and routine, does not respect them at all, or even is a film of any substance. I'm blaming Larry Harmon. The dialogue is broken from the old L + H films and unrealistically planted, the plot is embarrassed by an unnecessary characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did a great job with Ollie's accent , it was hard to create the wonderful blend that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is tangled, action is rigid, lines are horrible, physics is - impossible - (though probably Tried to give it a sense of cheap sets) and, in general, it's a terrible thing to see. It is even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last film in the 1950s of writing and photography. Make a favor and watch as much as possible from LAUREL and HARDY's original movies as you can and learn how things were. You know what MAGNATE is, do not you? Stan Laurel did not consistently respond with semi-moron chips to each sentence. I'm afraid of anyone who thinks this is a decent upbringing / honor for boys. Where was THE SONG CLASIC THEME?!? Why ruin "Here's another good mess"? Why omit the wisest? Why was there a crap-free gang of co-stars? WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ???? Why should Larry Harmon be in it? Why BOZO! And did the learning channel help finance this? I mean, indeed. Fart jokes, for God. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
