The earlier part of the movie was rather pleasant, but finally it became tritued. Although Turturro is an actor I like in general, his Luzhin often resembled an unpleasant impression of the rainman, and the portrait of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall, it seems that this movie is trying hard and ending with a pump-like look, despite its pretty good performances.
