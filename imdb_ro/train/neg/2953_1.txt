These reviews claim that this movie is so bad that his good will go overboard. This film does not have the bad guilt of Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. These movies were fun in their horror, but this heap of dinosaur dung is so painful. I was not in this pain so much watching a bad movie because I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust. The New Line Cinema refused to put into the theater. They cut their losses by sending it directly to the video, making it the most expensive direct-video movie in decades. Whoopi succumbed to being in this disaster after a huge salary. Plot: A millionaire clones dinosaurs, so he can launch rockets in the sun that would kill mankind and start another ice age. A female policeman named Katie Coltrane and an idiot dinosaur named Theodore Rex detained him to stop him after the death of a dinosaur buddy. The plot is given to you at the beginning of the movie, a film of its entire mystery. Then you have to worry about the fact that this movie is pretty awful. Whoopi looks agitated and tries to land it with her performance, but without any use. Theodore Rex is unhappy, and his scary behavior is reduced after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him, threatening to bite people and hit people with the tail (accident and purpose). I thought the Burglar was bad, but it takes a back seat for Theodore Rex: Whoopi's worst movie. Do not let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I did not see this when I looked at this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who must have had some sick admiration for Howard The Duck. Humor is on that level, and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's cousin. It's painful from start to finish.
