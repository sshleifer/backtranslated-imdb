As a Turkish man now living in Sweden, I have to confess that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if I never understand them. I think the actors in Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "Polish Wedding" with a Polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie I've ever watched. Unfortunately, I'm wrong with this "Angels House" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the so-called star woman Helen Bergstrom. The story is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think everything is a mess right from the start. a lot of bad action, except for Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
