Strummer's hippie history was a revelation, but generally this has kept a job. The fishing camp works best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many anecdotes of old semi-boring friends and too many stuffing stuff. I like Clash and Joe because I did not reunite them and sold their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this document left me to want to ... relate more. Using the campfire storytellers without an adequate explanation of whoever tells the anecdote about alienating the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed alone. Even using Strummer's "voice of the radio" did little to stick the movie together. And can anyone explain all the flags that fly behind the campfire? After the wonderful "full of fury" we hoped the Temple could deliver. A doc Joe Strummer deserves better.
