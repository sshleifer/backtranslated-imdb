Like most people I like "The Christmas Story". I have not even heard of this movie and probably a good reason - it's terrible. The same locator, the same narrator, the same director, but the lack of the fake warm of the original. Charles Grodin was a poor foul to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone who can replace him. The story seems forced and does not have the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "Christmas Story," Ralphie's obsession with BB pistol looks nice, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the bullet of the original neighborhood, is replaced in this film by another child with arms and a strange hat, but with few threatening calls from Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to match the original, even if this movie was made with the original crew.
