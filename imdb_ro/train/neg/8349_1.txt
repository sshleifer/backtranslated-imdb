The type of walking without reason ... I will never get the two hours of my life. The guy continues to assume his identities and cheat his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did you win this price anywhere? I understand he loves his father, but otherwise, the movie was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose of going so long and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did he enrich this life? Why did we have to see the dead old lady on her underwear? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> Although it would be deeper or more interesting. I do not recommend the movie to leave even during sleep ...
