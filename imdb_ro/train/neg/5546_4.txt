This movie is something like a sequel to the "White Zombie," because it is produced by the same human (Halperin) and features zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero of his days, fails to deliver with him, though. We have a man who can control the minds of the people of Cambodia and a quest to destroy the source of his power, so the zombies can be sent freely. Also a love interest for the bad man. If this movie really excels it is in pictures. The temples and dancers in Cambodia are very cute, and the zombies look very strong in large numbers. Unfortunately, we do not manage to see much of the zombies in action, and the love story seems to play a bigger role for a horror movie (although this has a valid plot reason later). /> I would have liked to see a 1930s zombie who attacked the helpless people of the city, but this film just did not give birth. And no powerful villain (like Bela Lugosi) was waiting to fight against our heroes. And using Lugosi's eyes? A nice, but deceptive effect, as it is never in the movie ... why not recreate this with the eyes of the new actor? Overall, a movie that might be extraordinary with a small script, which could be a powerful remake (especially if it keeps it in the same postwar period). Heck, if I can solve "The Hills Have Eyes," then this movie has hope.
