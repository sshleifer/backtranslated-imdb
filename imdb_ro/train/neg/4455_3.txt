Where to start? OK, do not compare this movie to fight for a start - ridiculous. If it were a patch on the fight club, violence, blood, gore, etc. would be more obvious and more realistic. Secondly, this film is not a soccer factory - which is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look embarrassed). Pretty fair, the story is pretty decent and the battle scenes are well-balanced - with a decent finish that I can add. But the whole movie is weak, seriously poor. As people have mentioned, the accents should not destroy a movie - I do not agree - either a simple casting error or a lack of effort in voice coaching caused by the film being irritating to the end - it was obviously from the first scene an American Geordie played the role. Do not hurt me, a good guy who looks good with a leather head - but not a football hooligan. I could go on for how ridiculous the football scene was - the "steward fake" situation. Also, when the GSE will play United in the north, they will go on the train waiting for just 3 of them - it makes no sense - this is a true organization of gangsters and fighters that is portrayed in the movie as a mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. From a precision point of view, West Ham and Milwall have not played in recent years when they were together in the Championship? Hmm, ten good. And I'm sure the "Bother" might be rolling in a mill in Milwall. Basically, a very poor film people want if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and you are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel that this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
