Recreation in the 1950s (London) Soho and those who are approaching. Based on a novel of worship. Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him $ 15 million and make you a $ 15 million video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people who can not really act is one thing - but two hours? Why did he think? Besides who am the audience? Who cares about a book that was well remembered. The usual London story of the chancer who took his chance. <br /> <br /> What could really pull this movie down? I know, third rate songs that sound like they were made on the spot. David Bowie has been crowning the film several times, and that's the culmination. The album in the soundtrack is clay dove material. But there is a good thing. Good Recording of Soho. Shame they could not think of anything to put them in front of them.
