You joke it was AWFUL !!! <br /> <br /> But that's despite the fact that I gave this movie another 3 and it was all on DVD. The movie starts almost a good movie, but it goes down from the middle. And, well, just saying it was one of the most anti-climatic terms in the recent history of the film. A lot of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of horror schlock, then this is the movie for you .... 3/10
