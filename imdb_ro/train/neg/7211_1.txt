I looked up at Inspector Gadget. It was and still is one of my favorite designs, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from Field Trip from Inspector Gadget. I wanted to slip on a banana shell and become the biggest detective ever. But the movie destroyed the reputation of wonderful cartoons. Matthew Broderick, a potential actor, was certainly not the Inspector Gadget. The first thing - in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in cartoon. In the film, Gadget solves the mystery of himself. In cartoons, it was almost always Penny, Brain and the great book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was accidental. The film gadget seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon it was pretty bad, where the humor came from. Another thing is that it's too much "Guy Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. Not just to be a cartoon of the morning. Also, Gadget should not have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. I also miss the real gadgets of the Gadget and especially the Gadget. In the movie, it was a chic convertible. The cartoon was a sedan police car and could be turned into a truck. It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get it from one place to another. But if there is anything, the only thing that was terrible about the film was that it was a feature film. The Gadget Inspector was a cartoon in the morning. The film was too serious, too overwhelmed, had too much plot, and it was not even fun. Tip for those who did not see it: NEVER to see it. EVER. Watch the cartoon, it's a classic one.
