This was the Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took two little kids to see that. This was the darkest and most bleak scene - the family has no money, the mother is losing her job, the father is killed in the bank, the bank theft was stealing the family car with both children behind, and after pursuing high speed, she remove from the bridge and drown them in the river. My mother is left alone. No wonder her Christmas Sprite has disappeared. Christmas angels do not save children who have drowned, and Santa Claus does not bring daddy dead! I thought this is the MORE message to send copies. Better to tell them that there is NEVER blood than to show them a movie like that!
