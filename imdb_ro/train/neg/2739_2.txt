I have no idea what was shot, but you can certainly say they have no budget. Bad action, horrific cinema and bloody plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. The WWF-style movie will make you cry ... where's the tripod? The filmmakers turned their attention, but they did not lose their mark.
