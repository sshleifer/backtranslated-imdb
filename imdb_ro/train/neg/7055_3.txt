allows you to start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic film. I agree with the last person who told me: "I missed joyride." LOL. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just terrible. Performances were average. Something terrible happened to the movie. Emraan deserves something better. All CELINA JAITLEY was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Emraan hashmi was OK. MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. he uses RADHA and claims he loves it only because his father is a music director and can help him become famous (since his father obeys everything his daughter says). One day MANN and his friends go to the GOA to have fun. There she meets with ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely for her appearance and tries to flirt with BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> That night ROMA can not open the door of her room and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he can not, the ROMA is asking for help. While she is gone, MANN is able to open the door and decides to get in and sit on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes and they have one night stand. However, one night, ROMA falls in love with him. That morning, they see the world in the underworld (MAHESH) who sees everything. The Don loves ROMA and can not resist what he saw. He orders them to marry and, being scared, MANN obeys Merry's ROMA order. Then their marriage news ends in the newspaper. MANN later learns that he loves ROMA after making a video together. Now it is caught between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also wonderful. The title song is also great. PEOPLE, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE.
