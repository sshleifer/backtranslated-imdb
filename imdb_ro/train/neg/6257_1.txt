Spoilers. Strange people, with generous tastes, have seen this movie. Let me add a balance, emphasizing the following: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. As Tom and Dan know each other, banging about the movies, he speaks clearly about one person, and I suspect he was the director who worked out his intelligent words carefully. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you heard about the HIV virus?" and sounds as natural as the question: "Did you communicate with nine extraterrestrial races?" By acting: white teeth do and a carved face does not make a delicate performer do. Speedman did quite well with what he was given, I think, but Marsden was terrible - insensitive, unbelievable, daring and astounding in all his captivity. There is an emptiness for his performance (see also Interstatal 60). The half-escape moments were not thrilling, but irritating and weak. Remember that Marsden pretend to try the keys in the door and then throw them down: "They do not work, man!" Tee-hee. And beware of semi-black-and-white flashbacks, which are initiated with a schlocky sound taken from the CIS and other criminal dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, evil and offensive is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a movie where HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan could have escaped his condom or not used it at all - excuse me, where was Tom while having sex? There are a number of insertion partner evildoers who are unleashed as a gay deception in general. <br /> <br /> Total: Beware!
