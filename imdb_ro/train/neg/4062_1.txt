Some movies have left me with such a sense of restlessness and this is not a compliment. Since I saw her in a theater (How did it end up there I can not ask), I was subjected to 90 minutes of nasty trash, derived, the main impression being about like another sick film "Do not answer the phone" - but worse. Everyone's reward, rape and everything, is shown without any distance (unlike powerful things like the "last left house") and total contempt for the victims (perfect) and for all involved, leaving the spectator treated as a sadar voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a shower. There are no credits to the director
