The toothbrush is about the ghost of an old deformed witch who draws the children to her home to get a prize for their free tooth and then takes her life. In the first few minutes we introduce the beginning of the 1949 fairy tale legend and then proceed to the present. Worry parcel is pretty much saved by solid action. He could have done without the Hammond Brothers and with some other scenes, but generally the gore scenes were bloody but fast, which had a minimizing effect. The candy of the eyes is pretty good for both genders. Working with the camera is good. Dialogue is correct, but cheese. I expected the movie to be an empty, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the movie.
