I felt compelled to watch this movie until I found it in a shopping cart and bought it myself, but I often came close to stopping it and taking out the money I had to buy it, I paid for him. If you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If there is something that the producers of this film know, it's the creative use of the blood and parts of the fake body for a disgusting effect. If this does not make you feel, stay away. The film is filmed on a home video camera with school props and terrible actors. It's called from German, but even for that, the sound is terrible. This movie is about as much budget as the budget, except for the special effects mentioned above. If he had spent a little more money on the actors and a real script instead of blood and courage, the film would have been a bit more enjoyable. The story is about three men landing on an island inhabited by an army of masked saddlers. They're captured, and the rest of the movie is about trying to escape. I call this story to be the most free, because it is indeed a series of torture and struggle scenes together with the incomplete dialogue of obscenity. There is nothing to redeem this film, if not as a gore without a mind. Consider yourself warned.
