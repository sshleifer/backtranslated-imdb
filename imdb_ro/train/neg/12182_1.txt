Where do I start? I think it's very insulting to original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love Annie, and I expected it to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! the actress is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, now I'm 25 years old, and Annie is still one of my favorite films. So I was really excited to see Annie 2. The actor was terrible in the movie, were any of the original characters? very badly written, guided and acted. This is not a movie I want to see again, and any Annie boyfriend recommends you not to watch this movie because it will leave you very disappointed. Girls who sing are not bad, but they do not compare to the original
