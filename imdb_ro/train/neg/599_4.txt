Okay, I have to say this before disclosing the "monster". saying it really does not fit into that category, just a weird thing that has an annoying spark! And personally, I think a grandmother could have run away from that, but anyway. Actually, I went into this movie, though the drunk main character and a heroin addict did not come as a call. But such scenes as when you run off the train and see that the figure at the door was a bit horrible, too, where the guard just got killed and the monster got his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> But then the disaster has remained since the monster has been revealed that it has just become your average horror with limited creeps or screeches. Slowly, I became more bored and wanted to close things. I like most people who have said they are rooting for homeless people to do this, especially the guy, gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could have been really special, but it has become what any other horror is in our day! Just boring and not worth the money. If you are looking for a cheap hope here and there, or a gore fest without a mind (which is limited, almost at all), give them away, but for all those who seriously watch your horror look elsewhere, much better movies there .
