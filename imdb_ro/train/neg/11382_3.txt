Anyone notes that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. The furious eyes look like it gives each enemy. 2. Holding hands to the front, agape and fearful eyes. 3. Smile Tommy Turnbull. I have to say that I really hate this show, I do not see it, but it's like the Lyoko Code, I have all seen at least one saying that this show is racist, uninteresting and useless to the limit. Each episode ends with winning robotboy, except for an exception when robotboy basically let this extravagant freakazoid fly on a jetpack. <br /> <I realized that there are many people who say the word "Suck" or farting, I think the aggressors of the show are quite shocking. hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God, what kind of school is going on. Not to mention his older brother, who is psychoped at the limit and has no other character of character. The whole show I feel is that it destroys megas XLR and Fosters. As you could say coop trio, jamie and kiva, and Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone, regardless of odds and is freely spirited, despite being a robot. There is simply no appeal to this show, I am surprised that it is still running.
