I caught it tonight in the Showtime, and I was amazed at the way a movie with such an exciting interest could end up so incredibly terrible. WHO IS DADDY? He calls Brandon Davis, Chris Hughes, an adopted high school, an heiress who inherits the heir to a pornographic empire left by his biological parents. Although the premise seems to be very fun, it is ruined by an inept director directed by director Andy Fickman for the first time, a skewed and predictable scenario and action that is bad with direct-to-video standards. Even normally funny, Charlie Talbert turns into a surprisingly subtle performance as his best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and rude dock. 1/10
