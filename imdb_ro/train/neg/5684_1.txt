garbage routed wrong. a sadistic nihilistic sadistic gorefest ... if you are the kind of person you like ... see a psychiatrist. even if you are that person, this does not make a good movie, the actor is very poor, the story full of holes of plot, the director should give up and find a real job, because he has no talent for it. I can see why people do not like uwe boll ... I had some of his movies lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! A complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to fit people, but here is just a barbecue. Horror movies can be full of desolation, they can be miniature artworks, they can be watched only when there is nothing else ... SEED is really very poor.
