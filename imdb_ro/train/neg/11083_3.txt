This movie was late at night when I saw him. It was interesting at first but did not convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually, I do not like the box anymore. He is barbarous, obscene and double-faced (by society) that some earn money to beat each other. Still, I felt the beginning of the movie was OK. Good actors, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how safe the blow is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but it was quite fun. As the movie continued, I felt he had lost some of his charm and lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
