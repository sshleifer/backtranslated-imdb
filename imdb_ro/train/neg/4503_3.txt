I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's Memoirs prove to be another failure of combing Western and Asian arts. In general, the scene is beautiful, but after anxiety over exotic scenes, some might wake up with them. The excessive cherry cherry was, frankly, angry. It is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the type of show, because the really beautiful geisha would not be over the Westernized pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have correctly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. An actor / actress can play any role when he / she can look that way. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions she showed in this film has not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a beautiful and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favouring actresses, did not even think it was Japanese. Some comments have mentioned the delicate, feminine features of Japanese women, with which I can not agree more. They are so delicate that I do not even assume that even modern Japanese actresses are not eligible for the roles in Geisha, not to mention the two Chinese and a Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably do not know so much about culture Japanese. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good shot to stir the curiosity of the American audience. But it would be an island for film and art if the film wins the Oscar for best costume, best director or best picture.
