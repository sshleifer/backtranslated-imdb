This film starts very slowly, but when the action starts eventually, it is unnecessary to follow it. I could not understand why a few events happened and many events happened before explaining them, making them a kind of confusion. The only thing he really has is the massive amount of blood / gore that he has, though, most of the time, there are no special effects. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. The lashing of the skin sounds like someone climbs a bunch of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateur sense, as the writer did not take long to perfect it. I feel like it could be a better movie if the effects were better and more time was done on the script. Frankly, I wish they did not follow this, not because of the gorilla, but because I feel that I have lost 90 minutes of my life. If you like the extremely troublesome movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
