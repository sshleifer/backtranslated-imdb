It's not the best of the actors' movies. The director focused on the style of the actor, instead of providing a good entertainment artist. He can be the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. It certainly does not deserve a neutral audience. Battle sequences are a total comedy. Dance moves in song sequences are pathetic. Music is medium. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the hype created over the film, the movie has failed. You do not even think of watching this move, even if you want to kill time. You can watch some cartoons instead. A good film guy can not digest this shit for 2Â½ hours.
