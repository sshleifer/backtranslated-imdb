I have to say - it's a stinker! (I gave her a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Only watch him if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of chewing and hamming scenery, but there is nothing else in this movie. There is no suspense, no profound, shocking secrets, no real threat to the welfare of the heroine. Some misunderstandings, a slight lift of the voice - that's quite a lot. Secrets are nothing that could not happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is completely predictable at this point. The plot, as it happens, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), an artist who is committed to painting a series of wall panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very widowed woman very rich and richer and a mother / daughter relationship that grows an older woman craves with her. Apparently, the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, died. You can even match the rest of the pieces together. Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not advance to the point where you are really afraid of its safety beyond perhaps a second or two. Why is it still about a year after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question that in this vast mansion there is only a servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the table, answering the door, etc. Everything, except for the apparent closure of the door - for that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters enters a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to make you grab the chair's arms and lean forward on the edge of the seat because there is no "pitching" tension in this movie, but just some boring revelations that is being thrown from time to time. <br /> <br />
