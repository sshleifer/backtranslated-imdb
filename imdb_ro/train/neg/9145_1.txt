Let me first say that I like to watch bad movies. It's funny how some of these movies leave more impression than really great. This movie is bad in a disturbing malicious manner. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's illustrious ego does not just limit the talent without talent but redefines the meaning of the words. This should always be the barometer of bad movies. A kind of Mendoza line for film. Mr. Mraovici writes, directs and sees as a heavy object, Arthur Sailes, struggling with despised wives and Christian forces of evil, as he and his partner Ben, "dead behind the eyes," are struggling for marital equality. As a libertarian I think homosexuals should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur do more harm to this cause than an army of homophobes. The representation of all Christian things is so ugly as the ham, the Mraovich trademark, that you can not take anyone seriously. Victor's Victor's brother, the Bible that is facing Jesus, is so terribly upsetting that you have to wonder how he was thrown into this role. That's because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich also distributed a director. The worst of all is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think the leading man makes the passionate words, canopy, and vagabond that come to mind? Sam also offers lines like domino, cold and usually wrong pizza. Final resolution: Suggestions for writing, directing, acting and casting. This is Ed Wood's quadruple crown. Congratulations to your horrible man.
