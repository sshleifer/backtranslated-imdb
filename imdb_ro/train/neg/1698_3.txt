Lynch. Man has some very good things! He knows how to bother us, then reward us by making us think in different ways. However, this is quite different. Dumbland's reward is an absurd comedy of 1%, earned by a stupid 99%. You may have laughed once, but somewhere around Episode 4 I started to look at it quickly. You did not miss anything. I felt relieved when it ended and this is part of this series. It is an annoying series of annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded with annoying animation, voices and sound. But recognizing this and other absurd qualities still fail to make Dumbland worth it.
