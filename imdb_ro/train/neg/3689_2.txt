The main aspect of Superstar's films at his later stages was the frequency, the gap between one film and the other. Being a well-established star of the cinema in southern India, the reactions she received before Baba were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he played in Tamil as a mass hero in 11 years was just 11 exactly at an annual rate. All of this was a great success. He had an image that many of them could not easily bring. But after Padayappa (1999), he entered a state of hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to see a movie of any kind with their superstars in action. So the film industry in Tamil decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> Film makers believed that fans would take everything they see to the Superstar. But this was not clear in this movie. As usual, media hype and fans' expectations were far above the limit. <br /> <br /> Rajinikanth's image was totally affected. Fans have slipped. The film's collection did not reach the expected level. The reputation of good people has fallen. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film was A.R.Rehman's plays. Rehman is known for composing good music for some of the worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. I never thought this movie would join this league. > <br /> You feel very depressed not because the movie was bad, but because the image of the superstar is coming down. It took him five years to regain his full back with two Chandramukhi and Sivaji films and gave the fans what they really wanted in a superstar movie.
