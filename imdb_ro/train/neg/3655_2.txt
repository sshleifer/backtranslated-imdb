Oh, I think this could be the gentlest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best b movies. The first proof is that it's not a $ 5 DVD. Oh, that's not too much for that. I got this on VHS, from a bin full of ex-rent movies to my local movie store. If I can quote blurb: "In the 17th century Japan lived a samurai who would have set the standard for centuries His name was Mayeda He is sent on an epic journey from all over the world to buy 5,000 bites from the king of Spain In while at sea a violent storm swallows precious gold intended to buy weapons and almost takes her life, Mayeda has to fight to survive and secure the fate of his Japanese lover. "He then continues to say," An epic set of adventure action in several million dollars on three continents "I probably saw another movie. This was not an epic, and it certainly was not a million dollars. No, "Shogun Mayeda" is really just the crazy adventures of English speaker Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). It's not even a shogun, but that's not important. What is important is that it makes a very good impression on John Cleese's repeated loading of one of the castles of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and his ability to move from serious scenes to the manifestation of the powers of the samurai's mind. Wonderful. The best thing about this movie is Sho Kosugi's English accent. The film may lack almost everything a good film does, but it does deal with some of the safest lines ever delivered by the greatest English accent ever. And honestly, do you really want something else? You can repeat "Shogun Mayeda" all the way down and resume the final line of Kosugi. The tape will probably be worn before you get tired of that single line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very very cheese.
