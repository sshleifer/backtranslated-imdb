Gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black and gay aliens exploring the galaxy until they stumble on Earth. Being homosexual, their goal is to have a masculine universe in which all people are gay. Therefore, when they discover that women or "females" live on Earth, they are initially terrified; in the end they decide to eliminate all the women on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist story, though probably conceived as a satire, gives this film a certain amount of shock. However, there is little substance underneath. As another reviewer has pointed out, there are some jokes beside the names of the characters (eg ArmInAss.); I think I once laughed at a little homosexual joke. I think we have reached the point of rapid film, a satyr of bad science fiction, but after that we had enough; We wanted the movie to end (and it's a short feature!). It is not brilliant or very well written.
