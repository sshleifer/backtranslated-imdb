I watched this movie on a Sneak Preview screen and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It is full of jokes and fart and does not boast the action sequences (such as the Little Germany shootings). I made a small list of the things I enjoyed in the movie ... and many of them did not agree. Dave Foley's Penis. 2. Banknotes fart. 3. Poop jokes. 4. The guy was a pussy. 5. No, Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again, Bush's fun ... WE BELIEVE THAT IS AN IDIOT .. move on. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. Plot. 10. Killing minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the songs were just scandals and there. <br /> <br /> Now, some good ones <br /> <br /> 1. The guy uses a cat as a noise cushion as in the game. 2. A lot of action. 3. Crotchy made a comeback (and a cameo of the postman producer) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few moments of "what's" that Boll has done again. He made another rough game in adapting the movie. Kudos for you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
