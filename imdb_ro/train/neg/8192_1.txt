Well, I have to say that the movie was so bad that I'd be out if I did not have to revisit it for work. The worst thing is, I wanted to see so bad I drove the whole city, I paid the parking 10 times twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. However, the plot has potential - it sounds great in previewing, but it is filled with completely ridiculous, predictable, weak points of return. And we hoped it would be a Christmas movie where Christmas must not be saved and that Santa needs no replacement, but another. The only interesting part was sleigh ride, and the bladed kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for little children, but for adults it's so lame that it's a task to stay with them.
