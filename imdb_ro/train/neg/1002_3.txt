I do not want to go too far in detail because I can not really justify losing much time in reviewing this movie, but I had to offer an alternative view to scare people to avoid the movie. The animation is cruel and the story substitutes between boring / useless and extremely irritating. Humor has been completely lost to the public, and yes - Ghost in Shell fans, this is not a science fiction action or something like that - a slapstick comedy, and humor did not work after it was translated . It was a total work to watch this movie and a terrible way for me to start kicking the movie, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for everything - I did not expect a Ghost in Shell sequel, but I expected something fun and just did not succeed. Yaaawwnnn ... Instead, rent Jorney to Kino.
