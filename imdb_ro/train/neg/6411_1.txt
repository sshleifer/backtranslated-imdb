Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like the movies that they wore and confused at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a woman who does not kill the vampires and does not wear at all throughout the movie. I was willing to do this, but I did not want to deal with the worst editing ever combined with unnecessary flashbacks. At the end, she seems to end her car in herself when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and that was just a flashback. With this movie is impossible to say. Can you think the same guy who made the Army of Darkness produced these nonsense? A much better idea is to stay home and watch the Dark Army on the Sci Fi channel. The film had everything: curves, zombies, and a guy with a chain for one arm. Forgetting did not even have one of these things.
