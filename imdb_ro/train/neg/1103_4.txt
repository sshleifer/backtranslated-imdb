As a young black / latin woman I always look for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie at the video store, I thought I'd be glad; unfortunately, I did not. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story has not been sufficiently developed. The film continued to shoot and shoot, and many of the characters on the screen just come and go without much contributing to the movie. If the director had done a better job interconnecting the scenes, maybe I would have enjoyed something more. Frankly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" over this day every day. I was not too impressed.
