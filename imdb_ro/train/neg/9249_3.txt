While watching the movie, I'm not sure what fun to take. There is a reason for the writer not to straighten his work and even act on it, you can not do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this film because of the director who was wearing so many hats. Mrs McTeer is the movie. To add to his amazing talents, portraying this woman was the reason I was engaged. Here's a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes drama and a wonderful story. I felt that this movie did not have that. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the chakras from getting what they wanted. Watch the jam, but especially for Mrs. McTeer's brilliant performance.
