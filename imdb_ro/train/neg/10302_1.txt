Since the "Rugrats", which falls under the category of good and fun cartoons, at a terribly mediocre and even horrible price for the past two years in the last three or four years, obviously the Klasky-Csupo tyrants should either without ideas. After I fell asleep all the characters, adding even new ones, replacing some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, she is not Chucky Finster!) And no sense of continuity (eg: in a Kimi episode I on the other day, Tommy and Chucky have a new puppy, but the episode later, the dogs mentioned above do not appear), you think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo. All I'm going to say about this is that it's shit! While it's not as horrible as Kimi's episodes, everyone is even worse than they were, including my grandfather (my God, he was the best character in the show but now he has no real purpose). The end is useless and the only difference between this episode and other new episodes ("98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. What a Fun!" No Star for The Rugrats All Growed Up. "Klasky-Csupo, please DESTROY this performance before it gets worse.
