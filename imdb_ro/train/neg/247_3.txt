It was last night, last night, on my pickup and I was so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park is air at 10:30 and we decided to kill time watching the show now broadcast, Father of Pride. I'll start by saying that I just looked at the episodes. The first time I watched him, I realized he was unhappy and brutal for nothing, so I thought, "Holy, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I do not have to see stupid cartoons anymore" . But yesterday, I tried to give my parents a second chance. It seems to me that it is a complete rupture of The Simpsons, replacing only the yellow human characters by the lions. The second is that I wonder why it got the TV-14 rating. Simpsons find it more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is some homosexual (non-functional) jokes. Simpsons is also much more violent (Halloween specials) and gross. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, but I have a word for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he was too much in the family. However, I must admit that Father Pride made me smile (even laughing one time) three or four times. Everything does not bother the Father of Pride. I do not like it, but I do not like it either. I've seen a lot better from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
