This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How the blob manages to eat is the biggest mystery of the movie. The blob moves so slowly that one o'p in a zimmer-like frame could get rid of it. The blob has a big piece of luck that enters into a typical horror film woman who, instead of running away, is still half an hour so she can be eaten. If you have not seen this movie we recommend doing it, it's too funny to be taken seriously.
