When Rome is a clear improvement of Getting There. Getting there I found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day I still consider it worse than Olsen twins. However, while When In Rome is not a terrible movie, it's not even a great one. If she had to summarize it in one word, I would say it is acceptable. It's a nice fun for teenagers, but I think adults will not find too much to go on. When he has good points in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent, definitely very beautiful actresses. I will recognize when I was 10 years old, I really liked it and generally liked it somehow. And I enjoyed movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minutes. Back to the target, both girls do not do that bad, in fact they are very appealing. In addition, their clothes have to die, and the scenery in Rome is absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is not bad at all. However, if the film is low it is in plot and scenario. The scenario is mostly cliched and has suggestions of already vu. The film, like most of Mary Kate and Ashley's films, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other Olsen twins will find some pretty unintelligent elements. Most characters are thin cardboard, and you do not learn too much about them, and sometimes the rhythm is uneven. Unfortunately, the stunning landscapes are spoiled by the cameraman's work, which seems to be repeated constantly. Everything has good points and can certainly be tracked. However, for my taste, it is a harmless and predictable pumpkin for teenagers. 4/10 Bethany Cox
