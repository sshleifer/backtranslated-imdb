I can not believe that the same guy was driving this stupidity and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well-written if it did not act properly. This pile can not even support this. It starts with Dracula's defeat at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignores the narrative that then describes what happened afterwards. As a result of the narrative, this could have made some success somewhat, but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films without having a good tie, but the name of the main villain. Even the actor who played Dracula was different (going from the dark hair of Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies.
