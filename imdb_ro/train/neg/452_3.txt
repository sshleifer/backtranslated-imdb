I watched this movie for a love project. tell Nicolas Cage to learn how to be his character and then recite the lines he says. My life can not continue ... I accidentally cut my hand ... my brother was close. Obviously, it's his fault. And since they have happy endings, they included the beautiful guy who cares for the sad mother and alone. No closing, a bad script and does not have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless you make a good laugh. The costumes were duly made and the excerpt made a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to do, but to keep it more specific to the genre, I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it's not an intellectual movie. It's not a chicken shot. It's not a strict romantic. And I can not show the kids because of sex and the questions to follow. On the whole, not just a good movie.
