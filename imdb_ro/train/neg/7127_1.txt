This movie was bad at least! The many superb cars are disappointed with being featured in this LAME movie. Start with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in a Ferrari F430. I did this in 1RR 50min in a small 140cc 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie is not right about these cars. Obviously, these writers are just the ones and probably drive below the speed limit with their hands at 10 o'clock and 2 am. I remember seeing how Eddie Griffin crashed a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo, running on 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... director ANDY CHENG IS THE MOST OFFER !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people liked from the oral point of view just to get into Hollywood. He participated in a film that describes Asian Americans in such a negative way as FALSE. Asian women >> cheap money that defaults on curves. Asian men >> lose compulsive players and bullies who beat all the time. What the hell is all the fear about the Asians? Why the need to always reflect them in such a negative connotation? I feel sorry for the way Hollywood ALWAYS describes the Asians in theirs a negative and false pretext.
