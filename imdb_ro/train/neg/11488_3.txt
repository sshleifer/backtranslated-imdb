It's hard to imagine that someone could find this short favorite if they saw most of their shorts, but they know that humor is very subjective. I have seen all of their sound shorts (by far the best of their IMOs) and I found this from their weaker efforts. In the year when it was made (1930), Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and a feature. They were extremely popular and their boss, Hal Roach, took full advantage of their constant work. In addition, it was a moment of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say it was an experiment that really did not work. As somebody else said, they do not play at their strengths. Too much dialogue and plot. The best part of this for me is the sequence largely improvised with Stan, like Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girl" stuff. <br /> <If you really want to see boys at the most creative and funny Blotto or Brats exam of the same year. They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think it can be forgiven because it made less than short hair. They made about 108 movies altogether. Very few (except those made at FOX) were failures, but there are some. County Hospital, Me and My Pal, Live Spirit, Fixer The top ones came to mind as the weakest. But other than those find something wonderful in almost all shorts. Pretty soon in my book. If you saw and enjoyed all the other shorts, then by all means, check this out, but I'd be willing to bet that it was less memorable for Stan and Babe.
