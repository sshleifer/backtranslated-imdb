I did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographic songs and dances in it ... It was a serious drama ... not the actor was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a serious quality actor. Definitely not. I had difficulty staying awake with this dissociated film. The message of apartheid and the "tribute" given to students who died during the overthrow of students is noted. But as entertainment, this was very poor and as a documentary the style was worse. See for yourself, but in fairness I hated him
