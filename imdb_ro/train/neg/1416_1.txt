Strange ... I like all the movies of this film and the movies with closed humor; but I did not like it at all! It's terrible, horrible and certainly not funny at all. Too bad can not make a whole plot, no disgust. And it was very boring. The long empty moments fill the film; could have been removed. It should have been in another shorter format, for sure. Perhaps I've been expecting too much from the crew - such as saving the lol -. It is also filled with cliche characters and unused situations ... I do not understand why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; Nope, mother, he did not see that! At least he is empty and brutal, poor and hopeless.
