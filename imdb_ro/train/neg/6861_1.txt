My first exposure to Templarios and not a good one. I was delighted to find this title among the offers at Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other classics of worship, such as "Spider Baby". The quality of the print is excellent, but this can not hide the fact that the movie is very humiliating. There is a delightful opening sequence in which the villagers behave in a terrible vengeance on the Templars (and fixes everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, weighted and eventually unrealized. Adding insult to injury: The movie was copied, not subtitled, as promised in the video jacket.
