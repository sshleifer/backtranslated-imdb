Most of the French films I've seen - and I've enjoyed it - were more words than actions, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well photographed and interesting actors. (Still, I thought at some point whether Gerald Depardieu is in every French movie ever made! It seems like this.) This movie has the same interesting views and has a good opening. But then he spoke, talked and talked ... which is good for a drama, but not for a murder mystery. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching this. Actually, the movie looks more like a play with almost all scenes playing in one room. So if you like pieces, you should like this ... but I want a little more for a crime story.
