This is one of the worst movies ever made. Banal. Foreseeable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that rated a point was that there were some beautiful scenes that accentuated Barcelona. I imagine they will use movies like that in Guantanamo or other prisons of the CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. Often bad movies have some redeeming features, this has nothing. If I were or would have worked on this, I would change my name. Truly a tour. It's hard to write more than that, but I feel that the world's film observers need a head on that. On the other hand, it will make a great gift for people you can not bear. You could send it to the politicians you do not like in law, ex-spouses, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and a number of others.
