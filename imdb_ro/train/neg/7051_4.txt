A movie about solving the problems with which you have developed and being true to you, Blue Juice is the mind candy for those who prefer surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the true star of this film, while celebrity Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend, and Ewan McGregor plays his drug addicted friends. For those who do not like their surfing Cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie suggests it's interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long photos of somewhat interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters lead to most of them being dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the superficial characters you have no idea why it works in the situations in which it is introduced. Only the characters of Ewan, Sean and Catherine make this movie a movie that deserves to be on the video box, which is why it was only released on the US video box after Ewan and Catherine became famous.
