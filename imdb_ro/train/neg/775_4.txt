John Candy. Do we have to say more? This is the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how talented he was as an actor. Let's confess it by changing it from the poor poor man to the horny bastard. Just a simple (subtle) facial change and we're leaving. There are many good bits in this movie and really bad bits. The best moments for me are KUNG FU U scenes, as well as when John (in a trance) steps up the stage and talks about how much his girlfriend loves - so he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure you read this, you might think this sequence seems to be very raw. It is, but it is also very funny especially because John Candy does this bit. The story is generally tormented, and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV graduates with Candy) do not have enough to do in the movie. Levy has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end (think of Rod Serling) and a wonderful scene when he talks to Mom with the phone. Generally, a good movie if you had a hard day and you have to put your brains on the wrong. I give him 4 out of 10.
