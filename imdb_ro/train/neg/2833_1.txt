With a Bo Derek movie, the audience gets exactly what they expect. A thin paper plot and some photos of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "The ghosts can not do that" is just that. The first fifteen minutes are ordinary television drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with a long experience in many different roles, but it seems that sometimes a famous actor has to work only for money. Bo Derek is inversely playing a beautiful, beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The film is a total waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence from Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude or bad women act, rent any porn movie.
