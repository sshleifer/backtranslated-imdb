I liked Dewaere in the Noir Series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, there are some guys that throw themselves in the most absurd and irremediable way; many people find such fun behavior. This was a boring and useless exercise meant to shock. I think smirk Blier's face, the face behind the room, annoying. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal liberty and licensed behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere bent on the abandoned lot, we have an idea of ​​a wonderful anti-hero that we will spend the next two hours. When we see him watching the woman in the middle of unfortunate age together with his friend Depardieu in Places Going, we have a good warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soulful. I have problems with any even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
