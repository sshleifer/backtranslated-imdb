A video below the average level is transformed into a kind of conspiracy for the next terrorist to be discovered in the American yard. Welcome to the madness of movies made directly to video. It is full of unnamed actors and actresses with a little worthless plot. However, this weird game continues and our "hero" bets real money and does well. It's something like gambling, unless the gambling side is gone and it's bleak. Instead, it is an online game with a low real value and you will get authorities on your queue if you do well. What makes it stranger is that two strange computer programs somehow struggle and everything is saved in the End. I will let the viewer see how everything is happening. <br /> <br /> In general, it does not even deserve a $ 1 rental. Loan it, please. "D-"
