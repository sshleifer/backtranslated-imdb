Cedric Kahn's films were based on characters rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and the Feux rouges), so it's difficult to see this series of truly in-vehicle vehicles interspersed with a few attempts to give Succo character. I can not find Stefano Cassetti as an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro sportsmen who are coaxed in films, such as Bret Favre. This unseen condition looks like a very vicious deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality than to admire his skill in carjacking. The little ones who act here come mostly from Isild le Besco, as the needy school, Succo, takes the storm. The interview at the police office is a miracle of gentle ruthlessness, with little fear of the mixed future. Besides Le Besco, this film is a little recommended.
