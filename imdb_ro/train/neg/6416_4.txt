SOME SPOILOUS SPOILS Why do people, when they are disoriented, ill or scared by a club, cut off in the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who, in their right mind, will hide under the bed when someone comes into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a foreigner's door and do not answer IMMEDIATELY, open the door, go in, cry some greetings, and then start going through their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you've been followed by someone you just discovered a murderer, what would you do? Are they slipping quietly and hiding under a wooden platform or metal gear? Are you, of course, fleeing in an old barn or another fallen structure? <br /> <br /> We could talk about almost any thriller that has come out in recent years, but since it's the "Return" page, obviously I'm talking about "The Return." I saw her free because I work at a cinema and make a screening spot for all the "terrifying" movies. I thought it was tolerable ... besides the well-worn clichÃ©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really unusual and looks like "Huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the script are given slowly as the movie progresses and is nearly enough to become interesting except that there was not enough explanation as it moved, so I was almost lost to the last two thirds of it. > <br /> If you're a tough thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there's nothing better at theater and you really want to watch a movie, I think it's worth a matinee ticket. If you think the trailer made it an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
