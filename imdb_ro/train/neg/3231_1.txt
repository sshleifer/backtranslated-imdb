This movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. After I just saw him, I can say that he does not stand up to these statements. The idea of ​​the film is indeed demented. But overall, the execution was not worthy. Even the final scene (eye-catching) is not that ugly. I was expecting something crazy, but it was of a lower quality than the gore on movies such as Violent Sh! T budget budget. Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed, there's no story (although most people know for sure). Gore fans will be disappointed because, unlike beliefs, the blood and courage here are few and far away. Not to mention that the actress playing the victim could be one of the worst in history. No matter what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it is clear that everything is tangled. Avoid it.
