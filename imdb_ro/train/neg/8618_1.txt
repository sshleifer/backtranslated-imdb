Incredibly terrible movie. We have recently seen some of this on T.V. My face dropped when I watched a terribly conceived plot and listened to the clogging of my mind. Not a single line from the captain of a single-line shirt can almost come to produce something like a chick. It was so bad that they made me want to exhale Rodney Dangerfield's body, swear and cry, "How could you?" I know that many movies are done in a hurry, hoping to earn money on the popularity of an actor or a theme. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It is sad and frightening that people should pay to see such sticks. The bottom of the basin, even after Sunday afternoon television standards.
