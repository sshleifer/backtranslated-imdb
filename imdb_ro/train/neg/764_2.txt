The script for this film Columbo seems to have been shot directly from a soap opera since 1980. The depth-of-movie movies are wonderful, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this movie, the only convincing thing was my desire to change the channel. Diary of the villain seems to be written by a romantic novelist. Great Lieutenant Columbo is not where near his famous, adorable, self-wiping, cruel sinuous; and the bride / kidnapped victim is a frightening, scary one-dimensional (she takes care of a small scalpel in the hand of her kidnapper - come!) I could have scalped my hand and hit it in your mind - you know what - in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would at least be TRIED to fight or to get revenge at least a little. And talking about reality ... the story revolves around a kidnapping that is solved and solved by the police. The police?? Save me. Everybody knows the FBI is taking over any kidnapping. Nobody was Columbo, a little deep and predictable murder drama written by Lt Columbo, who wrote to us and we were at 2 hours.
