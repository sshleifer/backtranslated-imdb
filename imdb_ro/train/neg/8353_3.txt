Beaudray Demerille (a poor Peter Fonda, who also directed), an aging player, wins a young adolescent Wanda "Nevada" (pretty good but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together, the unlikely pair (of course) is committed to looking for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. This is the story and you do not really need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It's just not there. The actor is very weak, which was quite surprising, as Peter Fonda was at the forefront. If you look for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful landscape and a good look of a young Brooke Shields. But her character is so irritating (especially at first) and bad, that it does not unleash at all as sexy or appealing. Too bad, but given the story, I doubt there might be more to do. I wonder why he directed Peter Fonda and he starred in this film. He probably even spoke to his father (Henry Fonda) in a cocoa (useless) in this ridiculous misery. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. Could not Henry be in the EASY RIDER for example? 3/10
