My husband is a big fan Robin Williams. I also like it, but in general I find that I have to "stay on what she does best" and focus on comic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the movie. The story was predictable. I realize she was inspired by a true story. But, I think there may have been some suspense or intrigue, even if you kept the truth in the story. None of the characters was well developed. It was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been further explored. More importantly, however, it would have been a deeper exploration of the "boy" mother. Her psychological profile would have been exciting to enslave. Of course, it has a long history that has only been attained in the least superficial way. If my husband had not been a huge fan of Williams, we would have left him for 20 minutes. Too bad I can not get back 20 hours or 2 hours.
