because this is the only way you will not believe that this movie is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of "Heaven Can Wait," which deserves at least to look at, is an excuse for a romantic comedy. It's more a vehicle to offer Rock some time for the movie for a poor comedy that does not play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes should generally be from the body of an old, fat, rich man, but they are shown coming out of Rock itself. While insulting blacks and whites, the chemistry is wrong. The film is not funny, the weakest is the weak. Go on rent "Heaven Can Wait" and live live video and you'll be well ahead of the game.
