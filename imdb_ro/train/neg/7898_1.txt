When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. Where these hilarious creatures, muppets big toothbrush moppets, really wanted to be scary? Or if they designed to have a good laugh (I honestly hope so). If you watch carefully, you can even see the strings that act on them (better by pulling them on the screen). Everything was rather funny than frightening and I had a good view of the movie because I was amazed at her general inability to have only a good part. It's a big joke from start to finish and I think this movie belongs to a new category: An unbelievable crappy, you will laugh from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on the act or all the other things)
