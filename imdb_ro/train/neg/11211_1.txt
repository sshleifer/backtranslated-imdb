There are so many things wrong with this movie, but to sum up: Terrible actors - so bad they must have been intentional. unsatisfactory scenario - he may have had some good ideas, but this was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad - in some cases the end succeeds in saving the film - not in this case. if you manage to stay on the whole movie, you will want to end up because the end does not even deserve to wait. This is the worst movie I have seen for a long time. It was a complete torture through this movie, I would have appreciated someone who warned me in advance. So do a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing to do. Even then you will regret that you have come through unexplained torture.
