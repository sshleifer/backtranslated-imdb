This show had fairly good stories, but bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. It is quite obvious why this show was canceled, although, as most of the IBS do, I never knew it existed until it was in syndicated recharges. Most of the plots seem to be copied from other shows and movies, which made me think that the producers did not have an original idea in their head. <br /> <br /> I have not commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. Gnomul was a beautiful character.
