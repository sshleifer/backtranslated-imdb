If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to pursue it, and I still have not managed to go from start to finish. I can not believe the multiple stars offered by others and they can assume they know the actors or are a disguised publisher! The action is atrocious around all, the scenario is blah, the Nichole playing child presents zero emotions even when threatened. The "southern" accent from the actress playing Amber's mother is ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and I have Texas friends - believe me NOBODY speaks like that! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
