Yeah, but I tell them I see them. I saw this at the end of the 80s and it was really one of the most horrible and boring movies I ever made my watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, the cinema is wonderful. The Czech settings are really amazing. The political context is deceptive, but unlike the "historically established" similar stories (for example, Zhivago (qv)), it has failed to make politics relevant to the story or even interesting. Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even "erotic" scenarios and slow-growing. It's all for love, but this movie was so boring, I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. I'm sure if I read the book, the story would have made less sense. However, life is too short to spend time on it.
