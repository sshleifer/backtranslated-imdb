I bought this movie for 1 euro, not knowing what it was all about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called a man of mutilation must be, if not very funny, at least filled with gore." It was not funny. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And it does not bother me to disturb the movies, but that does not mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the images was terrible. By acting ... there was no action. Only fractions that have been mutilated for over 90 minutes. This is perhaps of great importance for the patient's extreme gore stray. Do not look at this. It's not worth your time. It's just terrible. I wish I never bought this. He should kill the one who did that
