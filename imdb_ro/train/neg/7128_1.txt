I am a great person for renting DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, who made this stupid film, have never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various auto sites, including me, which has a 16K ALEXA rating. They broke my business, and now I've lost $ 16,000 and lost most of my personal time (Palisades Media peter relationship) you know who you are! Please do not rent or buy this movie !!! She's shit, and the people behind her are ripoff artists. REDLINE has a caste of losers and poor actors! This movie is a joke
