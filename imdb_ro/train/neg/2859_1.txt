It's done in 2007, and the CG movie is bad for a 1998 film. In one part of the movie there is a movement of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but this makes the highly amateur work of CG to look even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just terrible. This is as bad as if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Again, as with other films, the only scary part about this movie is that it was made and broadcast on the science fiction channel. I still do not understand how to get people who have some acting skills to act in these movies and then somehow make them behave as terribly as anybody else in the movie. For those of you who are unsure, the other poster is clearly sarcastic in his review ... or he is one of the people who worked on this film.
