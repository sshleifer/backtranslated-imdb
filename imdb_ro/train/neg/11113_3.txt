I often feel like Scrooge, hitting the films that others want - or write review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this film almost undiscovered, and, unusual for me, was fast ahead, not only through the boring, clich√©ed dialogue, but also the strange musical numbers. No matter what originality exists in this movie - the unusual setting for a musical, a lot of fantasy, an animation - is more than offset by a scenario that has no bit of wisdom or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be good people, but they can not wear a movie as a team. No one is really charismatic or does not have much sex appeal. They are both gentle. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite unique. The best part of the film for me is the beautiful costumes of June Haver and the wonderful body.
