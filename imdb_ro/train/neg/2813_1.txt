Normally, I would never rent such a movie, because you know it will only be bad if you look at the box. I hired seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's new Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found out that the video-visionary guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's new nightmare, I found this blade movie. This movie is incredibly boring, the act is bad, and the plot does not make sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the movie really was. At the end of the movie you have more questions than answers. On the "Max Power Scale" from 1 to 10, I score this movie: 1 PS I want to correct Corinthian revision (just below me). He says Robert Englund breaks lingerie, riding horses, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.
