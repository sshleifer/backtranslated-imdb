This had to be one of the worst wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by two matches. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince McMahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Price and Triple H was a complete elimination and, to be honest, I almost fell asleep, it was so out of action, the coffin match was not worthy of having a Undertaker appear in it, and the match between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke. If you're really a big fan of the WWE and you've lost the first days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you probably would like that. But I found that this Wrestlemania left much to be desired.
