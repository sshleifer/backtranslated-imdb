A family moves into an old home in Japan. But there is a catch is haunted (BOO !!!). Aw, he did not want you to jump. It's just a review. Set yourself back. Now anyway, he is haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and her slow-moving boy. This naturally does a 3-minute scene stretching at about 7 or 8. Horrid acts. A horrible story. But how bad can you ask? Well, it was so bad my brain started to melt and drip through my nose in thoughtful drops. It was so bad every time Doug McClure came to the screen I prayed that I had flashbacks of Small Wonder (Yeah, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "Wonder small" but it's kinda the same damn show, & I can fly the theme of "miracle" better) There are movies that are so bad they are good. this is not one of those I've seen: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My Grade: F-Eye Candies: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George receives 2 love scenes (one nude, one just topless <br /> <br />
