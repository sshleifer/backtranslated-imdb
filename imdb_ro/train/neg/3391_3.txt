I wonder who, how, and more importantly, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to straighten the biggest singular sensation on Broadway for many years? He is an Academy Award winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi, you terrible! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award winning actor want to see him playing Rocky Balboa? He has musical experience. Really? "Oh, what a wonderful war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of living energy survived the heavy hand of the process. Every character danced beautifully that it was charming, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw her on the stage, I felt it all. The film should have been cast with stars, strangers, newcomers, but you can see with unforgettable faces, even the most unseen of the group. Big actors who could dance nicely. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. I forgot that I am absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a musical Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas.
