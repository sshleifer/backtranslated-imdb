The story was boring, the girls were sick, and the alleged Italian male leadership clearly did not hear any Italian accent. Some said boys were drenched in this movie, but they seemed to be full of mediocre people. There were literally redeeming features about this movie. I think this is a cemetery for actors who will never work again, except the unfortunate Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discrete reason. <br /> <br /> I hope that Olsen twins find something out of the spotlight to keep them away from the entertainment business. There is no place in it.
