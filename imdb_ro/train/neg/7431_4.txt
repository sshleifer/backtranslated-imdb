CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the mid to late 60s. MATRON itself is not bad at all that I just saw her with a thin plot (a bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a quantity of contraceptive pills that she plans to sell to third world countries), surrounded by gentle gauntlets funny, though unsophisticated. I think that's where the problem is - Gags are not so funny with unsophisticated nature starting to show their age. Did we need another film to use a man dressed as a woman to lead the plot? Perhaps the most serious criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for a comedy
