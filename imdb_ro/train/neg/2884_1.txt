While working on a video store, I thought it was my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen and to warn my friends and colleagues. One day of a very heated debate of the worst movie, my friend dared to look at B.T.K. Killer, even saying that if I could watch the whole movie and say that my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he would be watching. I lost. I think I even made better videos than in high school, and these were some great facts of a young genius. This film not only did not contain what appeared to be production value (it seems to have been shot on a bad camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wood, naked and pathetic does not scratch the surface) like and the feeling of film generally bad. I remember a scene where I heard a glass battle, all of a sudden I remembered some high-school plays (I know I'm referring too early to high school, but this film looked very juvenile) both in terms of the set seemed too fake, but also as if people had read the lines in the script, they were not completely sure of what actually happened. My review does not make this movie of justice, because I can not describe how terrible the time spent in watching this thing. It's almost ironic to do a pathetic work describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
