How this movie was made with so many big stars is beyond me. This is a terrible movie with a clich√©, with the worst act that any of these actors ever did. It really surprises me that so many of these stars in the list would agree with this unfortunate movie. What's even worse is that there are almost 100 million here in the states. However, it shows that the big stars can pull in their pockets, even if the movie is terrible. I'm sorry for everyone involved in this snort-fest. Billy Crystal tried best with what he was given, and the rest of the stars seemed to go through the movements. No matter what you do, you do not fall for an excellent distribution, because no one could have saved it.
