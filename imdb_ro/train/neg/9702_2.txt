I do not think this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and I went mad at the PG rating and I wrote R. I would recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18 years of age, regardless of the R limit. Why? Contains a jungle scene with several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but that's not something for the little kids to see. True, it could be the traditional clothing style of African Indians (...), but ... I think partial nudity should give a movie to a rating R. I did not see the movie but, I think, it was good.
