You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse that will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You'll get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we have a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to tell us that he is not dead as though we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul who married Ethel Merman a few years ago, and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film, Ernie jumps first and portrays the grandfather who binds to his long lost granddaughter. I've seen it before. You may enjoy this movie, but please do not say you have not been warned.
