This movie was absolutely ... ugh can not find the word oh wait ... nonsense! I mean when it started to be like it looked good and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and had nothing to do with the fact that I had a late presentation because it was a total dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried the best, but the song could never live up to Sholay's original track. I want to say what he was thinking of doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year as well as Black? Ajay and the other guy were good, especially the one who played the raj, because of all this he was the one who should look. What was Amitabh doing? It destroys its dignity by making all these stupid movies. First, Nishabd, then Cheeni Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and now that means he has to get a little bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood before losing all his respect and telling you he's already gone half the way. I mean, all this is very good for other actors, like Shah Rukh Khan, who now gets a very good name because of Amitabh's recent fall. I never liked him because he thinks he is God and I just knew that Abhishek would be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend on something good go watch Heyy Babyy, because it's just the funniest movie ever and is number one in the charts!
