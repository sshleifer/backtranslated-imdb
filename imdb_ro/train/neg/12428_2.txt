I liked the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I still wonder why they made this movie terrible. Working with a plastic gun and a toy car that can go to another home is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this movie are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
