"Envy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are inappropriate characters. That's not the problem. It is that they are careless and do not care about them at all. "War of the Roses" contained inappropriate characters, but due to correct insertions we grew at least to be interested in their fate, while in Envy the introduction is thin, the characters are never credible and the plot makes things worse. Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller made a campaign to launch this video directly and now I can see why. The film suggests he is "the best friends" with Jack Black, but the first five minutes are filmed showing that Stiller hates Black. I thought this would develop into a kind of unilateral relationship (to "The Cable Guy"), but it never happens, instead of Stiller insisting he is "best friend" and I felt confused while it seemed to treat Black, "poo". The story of the movie is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it should be a story of exaggerated morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in misery. Walken offers good performance, but Black is off-key and annoying (and usually find it very funny). It's not a terrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - it's not one of the worst movies of all time, but it could certainly be better . I wish Va-Poo-Rize to exist - so we can make this movie disappear forever ...
