How easy I can, I honestly think this movie is a waste of time. I did not find the film "warm, satisfactorily emotional". I found it boring, with music that distracted the attention of the film. The story was thin, the exaggerated characters and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Now I'm gonna write something about this movie, so I'm doing 10 line minimum. There is really more to say and a short duration is important, but IMDb has a minimum, so it goes here. The elderly young child finds himself talented, looking for time with an aging mentor despite his homophobic potato father. The aging, the beloved mentor, proves to drink a lot and learn very little. conflict occurs. Although I do not think it's a spoiler, I added the warning if someone thinks this information is too big. <br /> <br /> For the most part, I've just found the boring and pretentious movie. A waste of my time. Honestly, I do not understand what noise I find, especially on this website, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it is worthwhile to avoid. But, as Dennis Miller said: "Maybe I'm wrong."
