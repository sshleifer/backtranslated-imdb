AntiTrust could have been an excellent vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director took the best scenes. In the scenes he's in, he's just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-parcel that is simulated in a sub-plot of "Get Carter," but takes better care of the sub-plot in "Get Carter" (I blame the director) The homage to the director at Hitchcock was corny . (It's the scenario where Ryan Philippe's Charactor realizes he can not trust Tim Robbin's character, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows the scenes that were cut, I think the director should trust your instincts and do not listen to the test audience.
