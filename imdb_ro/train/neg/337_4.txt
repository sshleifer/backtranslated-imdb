Well, let's say. THE GOLD CHILD falls into the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has some funny lines (sometimes quite annoying), but you're still fun. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role of villain Sardo Numspa (what was the ed *** name is this?). Who should watch the golden child ... hard to say, but my best guess is people who like embarrassing movies and can be amused by a bad action, a bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialogue. 4 out of 10
