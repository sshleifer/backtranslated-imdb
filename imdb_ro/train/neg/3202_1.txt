If you've ever heard these three words spoken to you ... "Joe Don Baker," you're afraid ... Final Justice is a low-budget movie based on a sheriff in a Texas city called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo). He is a nasty, thin and rude character who is looking for a murderer in Malta who has murdered his partner in Texas. His partner, in fact, drops twice in the movie. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) gets to jail 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere. In addition, he shoots everyone as if he were in the wild west. I think no one told him it was the twentieth century. A female policeman is tasked to show him around Malta (which looks like Elaine in Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can get her hand on the red. She must be crazy! The bar racers are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I started to connect with unhealthy women. Well, at least it was better than to see Geronimo trying to make a way out of it. The end is wrong and somewhat predictable and I'm glad it's over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker in the movie. It's so hard to imagine how it is in the TRE Bond movies ... very strange! Anyway, if you're laughing, then see this on MST3K sometime. I also heard another bad movie (among many), the "Mitchell" version of MST3K is released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see this!
