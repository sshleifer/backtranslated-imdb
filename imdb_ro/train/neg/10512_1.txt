I hired this movie for one reason Tom Savini, respecting her work, but that was a real disappointment, I had horrible moments, half of the film was naked women so-called "fallen angels" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was occasional "Blair Witch" black and white movement moves camera scenes. Tom's character was really horrible, horrible scenario. And you have to love the lines I use. "There is someone there who is there, that's not funny." No, but your action was. I wish I could give a kick from scratch! The names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but gave up Anthony, The Breakfast Club reuniting in the forest an unforgivable act.
