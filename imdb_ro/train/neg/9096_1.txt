I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've been watching for a long time. Trying to get the same characters with different people is such a bad idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in that regard, they would have to cut their losses and tell her to deal with her. Instead, they get new actors who are horrible about what they did. I felt like I was in a high school or a bad colleague, playing with the lever to act on these people themselves. Where do some of these people receive? Was it their first movie? It certainly seemed so. This film is also parallel to the original in a few lines of speech. I just finished looking at the first one and I climbed to the 2nd place. I was very excited to look at the second and became the worst show I've seen for a while. I never hardly ever * EVER * stop a movie, but this certainly disappeared after about 30 to 40 minutes.
