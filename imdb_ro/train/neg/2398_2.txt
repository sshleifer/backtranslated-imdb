Being a fan of movies such as "Sale of Fire", "Where is Poppa", "Avion" we saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of true comedies and satirias as mentioned above. Well, THE NECESSARY CONFLICT! Not only is not that funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad in a weird, pleasant, but very stupid way. It's bad - bad. The script does not contain a single fun line, which is rather in the way when you try to entertain your audience with humor. The impediment of Adam Arkin's speech is probably the most annoying thing in this film. However, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from feeling smug along the movie and does not have time to look into the room. This charismatic amateur fits nicely with constant errors of continuity and bumbling along the story - if you can find one. Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, who always refuses to be called an actor. I saw some Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. However, Kenneth Mars is good. Within a few rows he gave. I'm not easily scared of bad comedies, so I kept watching and searching for quasi-jokes every 5 minutes or so. The movie is actually a sort of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he does literally: Starting 75 minutes in the movie, he is in every scene. But it's too little, too late. When movies try to trick you into thinking that their lack of professionalism is the reason they should like because they have the right intentions, I remember the students who did not prepare for an exam. In these cases, you must remain strict, and the degree must be "F". (But please do not assume that I am a professor. This is a profession with respectability somewhere between the politician and the molester child). If you look at a horror movie / fun scifi to watch and contain jokes try "Bruwn Camping's Brain Man". Or watch Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern, superficial SciFi Schlock. They are just as funny, though involuntary.
