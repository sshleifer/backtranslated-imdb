I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Confidential comments appear. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a wounded, cute retired policeman (cliche!) Helping everyone - smiling like a post-op patient lobotomy and laughing at his dead son. His adopted son returns from the Special Ops Army and because he "saw things" - portrayed by clenching his teeth, if someone mentions something about the past. It's time to clean the streets of another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed the bad boy) and his adopted son. Oh, the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason to want to bump the bones of the ex-army grandfather. This happens in about 2 minutes from a scene. The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than story and act. Everything was done before, everything was done much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen it on Waterworld twice. Erm, the movie is called HONOR and the tagline has "Bloodsport and Kickboxer Producers" - visit other films by director David Worths and you will soon realize why they put these two movies there, even if have over 10 years. Such classics as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - tells everything really. I'll give you Â£ 10 if you do not go see this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - I apologize for names that I do not know but tell you something.
