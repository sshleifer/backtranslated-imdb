Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her teenage career career ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies released for years, an unequivocal disaster in which the two leaders give themselves to a frantic exhibition of their trademark tics in an effort to offset a scenario evil and evil direction. This should have been suffocated at birth. I hope John Cleese was paid a lot because his name was attached to this disaster. He is the only interpreter who came through this dirty mess more or less unhurt, his only mistake being that he did not realize that the rest of the cast would make the image fall.
