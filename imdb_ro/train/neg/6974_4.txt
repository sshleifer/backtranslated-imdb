The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but not in any way that makes any sense possible. At some point, some children wander through deeper levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They begin to talk about what they will find there, and one of them (a girl) says they bet they will find a blue monkey. Yeah, that's it. Completely inconsistent with the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would expect to find a blue monkey in the basement of a hospital. I feel embarrassed that I remembered someone she had to remember suppose!
