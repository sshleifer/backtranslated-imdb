I'm sorry, but, apart from Kim Basinger, doing a good job acting frightened, it was one of the most serious thrillers I've ever seen. Logic is thrown while 4 young boys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall, then shoot a guard. However, no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or going back to the mall, it moves away and ends in the middle of the forest, with the boys in hot pursuit. I can not even describe how stupid I can see that the woman ran away from four retarded beatings, wearing a box of red instruments, screaming that God would come to help her and then have sex with one of them after they killed them the good ones. Please trust me, it's bad and a little tasteless.
