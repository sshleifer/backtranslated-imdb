this movie was a major defeat. the level of cruelty and relentless violence in this movie was very disturbing. some scenes were really ugly and frightening. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the character of the lead protagonist was as thin as they were. the sick / glass atmosphere has borrowed in the top theaters. little or nothing could have been learned about this Spanish civil war in this film. fortunately, I was in Spain and realized that this is not realistic! In addition, the use of homosexual attraction as "horror" was also very offensive and ill-treated, while the DVD is packed and published to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if trying to distance themselves from this mess. I think if you like to look at the children and pets that were brutally murdered, this movie could bring you specially.
