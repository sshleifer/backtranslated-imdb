Soon after watching this movie, you'll realize why it has not got to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, this is a common theme at Hollywood, breaking good quality movies, disastrous precursors, sequels, etc. The plot of this film was all over a ping pong ball, and the character's development was non-existent. I seriously felt I was watching a comedy in certain moments of the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy has to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time. The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie and actually brought a joy from watching this movie. If you are a great fan of Carlito Way, I recommend you do not look at this movie. If you decide to follow it anyway, treat the movie as if the original was broken, because that's exactly what it did.
