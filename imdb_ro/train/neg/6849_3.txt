This quasi J-horror movie followed a young woman as she returned to her childhood village on Shikoku Island to sell her family home and meet old friends. She discovers that one, the priestess daughter of the village, drowned a few years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood boyfriend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bonds between the dead and the living become weak, and friends and villagers see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike J-horror movies, suspense is not really built, the result does not seem to be too threatening, and the ultimate boundaries of the absurd. This film is like the plain white rice, cooked a little long so that it binds with the muscles. Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your white rice a little too much. You will end up eating it, because you need it with food, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the table because of its sticky, tasteless taste. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
