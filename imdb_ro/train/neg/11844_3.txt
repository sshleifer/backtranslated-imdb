Whoever is a sucker for 1920s jazz, the 1920s dress, Charleston yachts and ultra-inclined yachts (for example, me in all respects) will want to enjoy this movie. But sad is that everything is there. The story is trivial and obvious, acting for the most part either terrifying or playing on the farcical side of the departures, and when everything is there, there is much more to it than the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautiful bad movie.
