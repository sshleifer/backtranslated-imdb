Do we really need more narcissistic trash on the Baby Boomer generation? From a technical point of view, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "60s idealists" of the 1960s read Marx, burning their cards, and generally prolonging a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in the classroom. But I remember well, and 9 out of 10 were just stupid fools who would believe anything, as long as they were destructive. This is just another exercise in the self-importance of children who have never grown.
