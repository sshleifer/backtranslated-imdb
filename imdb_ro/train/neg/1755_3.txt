This film is not devoid of charm and also has a bit of heat, but ultimately this effort is too futile and too focused on driving. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her screen all the time, but takes too much of the spotlight away from the rest of the cast. Another problem is overloading the cluster scenario. Daughter secretly withdrawing from college, an older woman is struggling to get a good job (and eventually ends up with some pretty scary work), the power-struggling executive with its executive toys , who goes for glitz over the substance, the journalist to trust her, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these things, that is, all are really rooted in reality, but in combination they are too much and leave us with too much already-vu and too few surprises.
