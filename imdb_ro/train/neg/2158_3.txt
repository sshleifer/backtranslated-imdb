I can see clearly why Robin Hood flopped fast. The first episode of this is probably the worst thing the BBC has issued. The opening scenes were as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and the struggle with the sword was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was that Robin Hood beat a cow dressed in makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore glasses in the 12th century? No one. The series may have improved dramatically since then, but this first episode has quickly put people's hopes and is basically a bunch of cr. A great hero of England has been disgusted. <br /> <br /> "Do you tolerate this?" I will not be sure if the BBC does not begin to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
