or anyone who prays for Al Cliver's view by fighting a naked guy high 7ft in height in a full nelson, your movie has arrived! Starlet movie Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a $ 6 million redemption to be delivered to the island's hiding place. What is not based on him is the veteran of Vietnam, Peter Weston (Cliver), hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they did not really rely on was a local tribe who likes to give their young monster a cannibal god with their naughty blood eyes. Quite the same movie set up as CANNIBALS, this price is much better when it comes to entertaining value, thanks largely to a hilarious hilarious piece and a monster with no bulging eyes (Franco confirms that ping pong balls have been divided on the interview the disc). Franco gets strong support from EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most things I've ever seen as a guy who is not totally eluding - nearby - trying be it). The film contains tons of nudity, and the gore (variety Tempra paint) is there. The evolution for me was the worst battle between the world and Cliff and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Unfortunately, Jess passes in an amazing (and sometimes agonizing) one hour and 40 minutes when it should have been running for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the Severin DVD looks fairly beautiful, but there are some strange ghosting images happening during some of the darker scenes. Also, a long dialogue section is in Spanish without subububes (these are an option, but only when listening to the French song). Franco offers a pleasant 16-minute interview about the film and has much more fun to say about Buchfellner than CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
