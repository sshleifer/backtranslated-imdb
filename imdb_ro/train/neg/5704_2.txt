After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time to go and see it. Well, I do not know why I was disturbed. Practically, this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a vast mastery of the ancient treasure hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be held in the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the Knights say move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages characterize Charlotte as a ship? How do all the clues and riddles figure out in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become masters thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded paper in the world? These are just a few of the plot holes in this inertial action of Hollywood action. Cage was in some great action movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - why did he fall himself? Is it too old? His character is quite annoying - In a way, this "ordinary" type steals the Declaration of Independence, overcomes thieves with weapons, escapes the FBI, and generally seems invincible. The whole movie makes no sense and everything was quite disappointing.
