What a boring movie! To sum it up, in reality, only Nana Patekar beat Karisma Kapoor's nose as she tried to flee the village with her son. Can anyone say? The concept was not too bad, but it was badly executed. Canadian sites and some scenes in the village were beautifully shot. However, in general, the cinema was short. The story could have been great, but the movie seemed to shoot. There is so much stupidity a person can take, not to mention three bloody hours of it. The best part of the whole movie was "Ishq Kamina", and it was only five minutes. Besides, this movie was a piece of nonsense.
