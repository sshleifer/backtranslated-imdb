This shit is like watching dry paint. I'm so disappointed, because I was so eager to see that. There is no sense in this movie. If it has never been done, nobody would have noticed or cared for. They have improved because of all the big names in it, but if there is nobody, nobody would ever love this movie. Seriously, I was at that moment when I was halfway through the film I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and I thought, "Hurry up and you already die!" This is like the "Club of Joy of Happiness" without any joy. It's "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a big cast-out) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic ... Oh, until it's finally over. I'm sure they will all be nominated for Oscar ... - 4 stars for cinema and the ability to convince big actresses to engage in this junk.
