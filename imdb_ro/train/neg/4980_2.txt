I just read a defense review of this movie because it has a low budget, now I'm dealing with things. CGI monsters were well animated, but they were implemented in the worst possible way. The battle scene was not just a fight, it was just one shot of an actor, then a monster blow with a lot of interaction. When the monster interacted, it seems to have been done in the pro paint shop. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use patterns and dolls. Maybe it does not resemble fantasy, but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jackson's early movies. As far as Beowulf is concerned, he did a descent job, but the rest of the camp did not try, nor did they forget where they are. The script seemed confusing to me. One minute they will speak as if it were a modern day to set the next meeting of the Shakespeare Theater Speech. I'm not saying that it should be all "you" and "it is," but you have to find a cohesive balance, so the lines sound like they come from the same person. part of the beginning when Beowulf quoted the old testament that would have been found had he not spent the rest of the movies talking about gods and commandments. In short, this film is very polished but still a return.
