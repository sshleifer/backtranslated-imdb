The television show of the 1980s, updated with fresh female flesh, and refined language. "Dukes of Hazzard" passed me; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the New York or California television; or perhaps he would be pursuing. However, somewhere (like the videos that accompany the updated version of the 2005 movie), I knew it was a fast Dodge charger, orange - and "General Lee" is still good. <br /> <br /> Hunky Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her on her short anger - but even her pink bikini can not beat the competition from a topless topless coolest bedroom. The bad part involves a burg Burt Reynolds (like "Boss" Hogg) who threatens to turn Hazzard County into a strip mine. ** Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
