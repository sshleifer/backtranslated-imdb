The film is essentially a boring string of horrible cliches that do not offer a real intercultural perspective. The foot of the Middle East of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: obviously there are mud brick villages, traces of dirt in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black clothes and belly dancers. I wonder how the camels and palms have disappeared from the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is very sketchy and many situations are hardly credible. The initial idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you were looking for cultural knowledge, you should omit this movie.
