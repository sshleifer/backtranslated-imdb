Usually, any movie with Sylvester Stallone is usually sucking the ass. Rambo: The first part of Blood made no exception. The only films that Sylvester Stallone were good in were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is extremely unrealistic and boring. It has action, but it is not very good. I did not like to look at her and I would never forget that. No wonder why he won the Razzie Award for the worst image. I would give it a 3/10, the only reason she got 3 was because it had a somewhat good, but not good enough action.
