Given the potential this movement has had, the reality has been disappointing. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not do that. Most of the action was predictable. The banknotes were easily filled. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something About Mary". Here it seems he only goes through movements. If he has to pick up the plot points in "Friends", he should have known something was wrong. The humor of the toilet should have stayed in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Watch "50 First Dates".
