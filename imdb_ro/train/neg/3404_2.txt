I will not sacrifice this film for all the countless techniques f u | c | k | u | p | s, it would take two days to point out how everything is not even possible. Others have already highlighted all the relevant stupidity. Considering all of this, I could still have enjoyed it, even if it did not include all the maddening, nauseating, angry, sentimental Disneyesque nonsense that is so far anywhere, but nowhere more than in space, where the slightest mistake can mean instant death. "Crew" and real "astronaut" were also guilty of putting all their cumbersome crap before anything else. It completely ruined any value that production could have left. I'm surprised NASA has left this garbage out, so so many people get so misinformed about something so important to them. If you have not seen this yet, save your irritation. Follow Apollo 13 again. At least that's what it's been trying to be real.
