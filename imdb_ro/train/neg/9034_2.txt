The story is a bit slow and a little bad. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Meanwhile, Melvyn Douglas plays his normal role, and Constance Bennett is just that - except for some of her cries that were funny. <br /> <br /> In addition, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I would like to have more lines, as it disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see Ruth Gordon so young. I only saw her in the crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the' 80s and an old woman mocked. The story, the best part might have been the last few minutes when we see a stuntman who does amazing things on the skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. It was an amazing and humorous film. Generally, I can see where this film - the last of Garbo - was not a box office success. It simply draws too much, goes further in connection with cheating. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew and he called it.
