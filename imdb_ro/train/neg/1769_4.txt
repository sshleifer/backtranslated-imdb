He saw on 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): The movie Stepy King Vampire Campaign has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme strange about 3/4 in the movie and you wonder if this movie could have a cult following the King's fans. It is the story of a mother and a son who are sleepwalkers (who move in the form of a feline, eat meat, require life, a race close to the humanoid), moving from one city to another, seeking virgins to feed themselves is kept alive. They meet as quite normal upper class men, except that they are secret and cat lovers hanging out of their house day and night. Cats are lethal to them, so they put traps in their yard to try to keep the population down. We came to see them break a few necks when they attack (which is also the first time in my shooting experience) --- we hope that no real cat has been affected in making the film. The boy is after a sweet girl who has a passion until she turns into a "sleepwalker" and then wants only her body. There is so much uniqueness in this movie that it could have been better if it were a satirical comedy in suburban life, but the director is trying to scare you every few minutes until you want to overcome it and remove the gore. Eventually, this is happening and the film is approaching Stephen King's typical end. The movie is interesting because the king's humor comes more than usual, but his strangeness is also very present, and what you have is a movie his fans will probably want and should have in his collection, but a valuable cinematic experience, ceases.
