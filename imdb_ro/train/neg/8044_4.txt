Well, I looked at this movie just over 2 years ago and now I took it out of the dust rack to track it again and I have to say that, in fact, I think this movie is good. This movie caught a buzz like a bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, like Final Stab was at Scream 4, and this movie is not that bad. I mean, he had flaws and of course it would be ridiculous to give up this show in theaters, but for a midnight popcorn motion, this film is not half bad. She has some frills and some very hot women that I could add. In addition, this shows Joey Lawrence's new look, although obviously he has not even won big roles at Hollywood ... ... I feel bad about man, he has had such a career in the beginning and mid-year '90 with flowers, some Disney movies and Lawrence brothers look ..... Joey Lawrence was a small player in the sitcom scene but then, as in a 360 degree turnaround, his career has gone to the south just making low-budget movies like this one. > <br /> Also, the film throws you in your mind, makes you think between the crew, there is really a secret someone knows, just to be disappointed to find out the secret. Also, he throws you on who the killer is, I had an idea, but I still do not think the killer was who he was, but his reasons combined with the secret were a great disappointment. Now, was there a secret that was released? This movie could have been one of the best movies b. But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also in college went on a spring holiday in a house similar beach mansion size with the one in here, so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie. so moving. Okay for a midnight movie.
