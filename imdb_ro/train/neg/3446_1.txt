This film on paper showed that it would be possible to be good after I looked, but I realized that this movie was completely terrible! The plot does not make sense, and I think we counted the best of 5,000 cut scenes each making the film annoyingly boring and ridiculous. I looked at this pitch late at night black no no sound at all just to add to SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, playing the opera I want to say seriously! This film sums up everything that is not good about this type of movie. To be honest sick say no more, but watch at your own risk this film is just the complete garbage, enjoy !!
