This is one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit on. The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's fun and fun? <br /> <br /> I will not go as deep as the characters, or I will be here all day (except that they do not exist, the characters change personality whenever it is convenient to plot), but who wrote the script and visual direction should be denied access to pencil and paper. The thumb down? I'll vote to cut your fingers. <br /> <br /> "Encourage an object / propulsion. Repeat this many times with different objects / props." "Make the characters do not pay attention to all the huge pieces of rock floating around they collapse among them, destroying in general, which could kill everyone at all times - but to make them stop and realize their fear when they see a green rock, almost harmless and almost pastoral, in the distance. Everything is a long succession of events, actions and behavior that are just there for the writer's convenience, to save him from thinking or making any effort to write the story properly. <br /> <br /> This is Plan 9 of the CG cartoons, except that it does not have the Ed Wood Pit factor to make it fun to look at. Do yourself a favor: Spend your drawing budget animated on Pixar movies.
