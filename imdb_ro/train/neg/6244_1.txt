Mario Lewis of the Institute for Competitive Business wrote a definitive, 120-page, line-by-line denial of this wonderful film, which should be labeled LIE CONVENIENT. Website address where its debit report, entitled "THE SKIPTICAL GUIDE TO A PASSED INCONVENIENT", can be found at: www.cei.org. A shorter version of 10 pages can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf Once you read these demolitions, you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is no longer real or dangerous than the 1999 Y2K threat, which Gore supported as well as the pseudo-scientific film DAY AFTER TOMORROW, which was based on a book written by the alleged UFO abductor Whitley Strieber. While James "The Amazing" Randi makes psychiatrists and Philip Klass for UFOs, and Gerald Posner makes JFK's conspiratorial theories, so does Mario Lewis with Al Gore's movie and the whole scam "global warming".
