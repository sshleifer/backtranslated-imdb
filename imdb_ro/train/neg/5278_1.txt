When a comedy movie boasts the wonderful soundtrack on the back cover, you know you have nothing to do with a top film. I hired this movie with friends who are waiting to have some chicks, but generally to get most of us laughs on another fun movie. We could not have picked a worse movie. The movie might have been fine with a few changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gangs were badly made and placed. The fat child in the film has caused us to kill, bless him because he was trying out the scene and the scene outside, but it was like a puppy begging for love. If it had been taken out of the movie, everything could have been supportive. There were funny jokes, I think one was when the group of boys steals one of the pornographic movies of their parents and it seems to be gay porn. But to sum up the best comedy, I'll just say the opening gang for the fat kid. He wears a colored shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done. To finish, the movie editor could have saved the movie by removing the fat child, cutting 20 minutes of school and making an end that is longer than thirty seconds of random questions. Oh, BTW, there are two good elements that the movie possesses. Kadeem Hardison plays a wonderful role and makes his jokes so that no one is missed or under-appreciated. The other redeeming element of the movie is beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored most of the film, which is a shame. Do not waste your time even renting it. He did not appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
