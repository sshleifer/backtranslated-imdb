The IMDb plot summary does not describe the essence of this film in any way. You should have read "Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the third camp behind your family church at the age of eight, listening to the preacher about the will of God, while all you can think of is to return home from your own Lego, starting from well-intentioned, building intrigues by planting real and surrealistic clues, such as how Renny made a cut on his thumb so fast, then slowly, a Christian jamborean, completely sacrificing his plot in a scourge of evangelism-induced craze.I think we have counted the use of the word "pray" about 53 times within five minutes at the end.After 31 years, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, "prey." Unfortunately, this awesome game of mind made the film at least for the last 20 minutes. laugh whenever a character would say "prayer" ( "Preyer" for me) because it became completely zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sank into her boredom from her boredom almost to the end of the floor. For all the salient Christians who have ranked this 8-10-star film, I suggest that you stick to your theological safety standards, such as the Circle Square, the Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, the Superstar of Jesus Christ, and others likewise. Stay away from more provocative brain problems in movies, such as Jesus' Field, the God Who Was Not There, What Would Jesus Buy, Or Soon To Be Released Religious. Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
