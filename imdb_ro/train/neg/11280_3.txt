This movie is about the life of a poor man. His business fails and can not impregnate his wife in spite of several attempts. The land is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the movie makes sense. The story is so badly said I could not understand it. It is a shame because sets and costumes are doing well and are sufficiently stimulating for sight. Photos are well composed in the movie. However, these redemption characteristics can not yet compensate for the evil plot and the bad story. I am amazed by the big names who have accepted to play in this movie. It is such a loss of talent. This movie is very bad. Avoid it!
