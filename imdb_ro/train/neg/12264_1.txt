You have 5 writers together, each writes a different story with a different genre, then try to remove a movie from it. It's action, it's adventure, it's sci-fi, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, this movie absolutely smells. 4.5 gives him a very high rating. That being said, movies like this make me think I can write movies and can hardly write.
