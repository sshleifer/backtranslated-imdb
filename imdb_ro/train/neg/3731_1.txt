I was raised in a "very Christian" household from birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the show and I was forced to see him in a group of young people at my church. This movie was extremely disturbing. I saw him when I was about 12 years old and I had literally nightmares about this for years. I used to sit up in bed and listen to the sounds of my mother's steps upstairs. If I did not hear his footsteps, I would slip up to make sure she was not kidnapped. I prayed so much every night for salvation, because I was terrified that Jesus forgot me. This is certainly not something I will show my children until they are much older if they are not at all. It took me years to get rid of the fear of giving me this film.
