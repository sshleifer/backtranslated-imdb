It's not a bad movie ... but it's the guy your friend makes to look. The story is not bad ... it only takes an hour and a half to look so much. It's hard for me to break this movie because I really like the idea, but it's just a long and thin story ... too bad. The main character never seems to change so much from start to finish. I mean, he's going through something "change of life," and he can just break a smile. I really thought Mac was very good. His strange oddity keeps the film as a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "take" this movie. If anyone can explain this to me, I'd like to be informed.
