I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I can see why. The act was the worst I've seen for a long time. Lighting and sound are at best. The plot does not make any sense even when it's awake (WARNING: I do not recommend watching this movie when it's awake.) This movie feels like you've seen the home movie of someone who does not get out too much. It is really a shame that all the very few money spent on this project went to such a loss, I look forward to seeing if any of those called has a career other than eva longoria which is the only "star" "of this film, which obviously was not hit by the bad guy. I'm sorry none of these critics seems to be constructive, but I'm going to say something to James Cahill, do not try again. In his words squirlyem "His severe lack in the good department".
