This bloody movie shows that even some of the best in Gollywood can not save a real garbage deposit. We could spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad about this effort, but that would take more time, You'll already forget 91 minutes watching you ... IT. Looking at this now, after Brando's death, he shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors has become. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in several lines to accept this. I have to fill in several lines to accept this. I have to fill in several lines to accept this. Do not waste time with this movie. I managed to do something interesting. Bye.
