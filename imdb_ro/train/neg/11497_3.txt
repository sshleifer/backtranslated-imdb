This warning against anti-Semitism is well thought out and may have its purpose at that time, but it's done without the slightest notion of making a movie. The director has no idea about mise-en-scenes; the cast ranges from evil to worst. The great Austrian comics Hans Moser are wasted. In his part, he ends up in a crazy asylum, which is conceived as a set at Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; one wonders if the producers had all their mental capabilities. A restored copy I saw (Dutch Filmmuseum) gives the impression that some scenes have not been put in the right place, but maybe the original edition was bad too.
