After Harry Reems's teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems gets desperate and empowered by having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who wears a cane and dresses like a magician, raises more women. Eventually, Reems decides to pursue him and put an end to the criminal syndrome. Despite being shot on film and extremely ugly, it looks like any other 70-year-old porn and is executed in the first place. The scene of rape / abuses is surprisingly restricted, and attempting to make money in "Desire of Death" is ridiculous. R. Bolla (The Cannibal Holocaust) plays a policeman. Colt, who's usually overhead, weighs in some scenes, but he's acting too well for my money. This brute could have been a lot stranger.
