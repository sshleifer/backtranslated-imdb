This movie shows us nothing original. Every idea or scene (action) can be found in many previously released movies. Fabulous Nick is completely clear here. Even Will Patton is calm and bad, not good. Mr. Duvall is ok but he has a very small part. So does Angelina, how can we determine her new stardom? Generally, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the movie slightly forgotten. Too bad, do not you think?
