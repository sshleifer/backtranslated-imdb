When I borrowed this movie from a friend (thankfully I did not buy it) on the pack (which seemed really bad and ugly) was printed "Horror of the final vampires". After I looked at it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. "Story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is pursued by some vampire / zombie creatures. The light, the sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video over a ten-year old VHS system, if not worse. I gave the movie 2 out of 10 and only because the promo-T-shirts seemed cool. I do not want to take the student film or the glitter films in general, but I saw Braindead and saw a $ 20 movie from students that was ten times better than this stupidity.
