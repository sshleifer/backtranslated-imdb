I really have nothing new to add, but I felt like I had to comment on this bag. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I ran my MST3K DVD collection again and looked at Hobgoblins for the tenth time. It is indeed very painful, but it was the next one on the list ... You can see that there is a small kernel from a real movie buried beneath all the crap that are "Hobgoblins," but it just could not get out. Everything about this movie is the 4th. Story, acting, effects, women, "scenes of action", ... ahhhh we forget. I can see a piece of nonsense like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") always and quickly, hardly any bad effects (I really like - BTW will be on TCM later this month - But the "Hobgoblins" is a game of luck altogether. The worst part of all this may be that it's about 12 hours after the movie's ending, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and a kind of toast, my medications and yet the New Wave dance music that Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman were doing in the living room is still on my way. This torch will take a few days. /> Success, is not it?
