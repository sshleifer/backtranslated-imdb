This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst of the batch and it is a positive proof that a five minute fab is not making a feature film. Poor Sid Caesar as a vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to look at him. As a personalizer, Robert Morse has no charm. Neither his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) "Songs" are awful and just slow down what is plotting down. The direction is virtually nonexistent, and the supporting characters add little. Lysette Anthony is quite the daughter of the emperor, but her voice was obviously called for a reason, a fate shared by many of the juvenile players. And the film is crawling with the snail's rhythm. Hans Christian Andersen should have returned to the grave when this occurred. It can be said frankly, at least from this film story, it is not surprising that it went straight to video forgetting.
