Still another film about a lead, tortured, selfish, arrogant, hateful, self-destructive character that we must be interested in. Do not misunderstand me I'm very open to all sorts of wall films that have a strong self-destructive character as their main character. What I doubt about this is that there is such a background for this guy. Why hated this guy and the world? If the script were treated more, he would have been able to bring some sympathy for him. Because he is just a disgusting hate, not tragic, simply hateful. After making great efforts to make this guy as crazy and anti-socially possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending .... This is not the worst movie that I've ever seen, but it's there to do a good fight! Man! Do not waste time.
