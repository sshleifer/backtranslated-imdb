It has very bad action. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show. If you see that. TURN IT OFF. Or you'll be back in the next 30 minutes. It should never have been broadcast. It's not great. You should never see it. NEVER EVER. So, if you ever want to watch this show, please do not do that. Go back to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place or Nick for Drake & Josh. These are much better family shows. So, believe me, I've seen it before. and is honest, and sincerely telling, the worst show I've ever seen and seen a lot of television. So do me a favor, and I never see this show.
