Bela Lugosi is great, as usual, but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one who played a perfect role in this film, but even a legend that Lugosi could not save the evil of the film's idea and unlike the oldest films of countless horror, this film does not set the state of mind very well . Even in the worst case, any of Bela's movies is just mediocre.
