I do not know anything about the movie or it's based on a well-sold book. He tried to guess from the opening scenes what it was about, the best assumption, a buried treasure, and a list of deaths. It took about 15 minutes when I received the massive suspicion that the movie was carp. I would not get bored with how bad the plot and the action were, but anyone who gave more than two stars must work for film makers I watched him until the hero jumped into the corvettes to rush to the hospital. She was dressed in suit, shirt and tie, got to the hospital in jeans and shirt. Nor could he obtain the right of continuity. I have a Christian theme, hard to miss.
