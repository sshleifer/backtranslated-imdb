I thought the movie was fine, but very disappointed that they did not surprise the true image of his life. I was so anticipated to see that his mother was a true Jamaican, that he was going crazy. Just looking at the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not fair. Which has completely lost interest just one second since the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, it's like watching a story about Mark Anthony's biography and acting as Arnold. I do not know what the writer is thinking of missing a valuable piece of film, which I'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. I'll say the movie was OK except Fla mare !!!!!!
