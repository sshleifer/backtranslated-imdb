Far from kick coffee you expect from a film that shares its name with the energizing warm drink Coffy hurry and never rises beyond being just a story of revenge. Indeed, if the film were a cup of coffee, it would be rather weak and water-filled, filled with some unwanted jets and lacking a persistent taste. Sporadically, it strikes the place, but otherwise it is not the dramatic action drama that it hopes to be. Coffy is a nurse who take the law into their own hands and provide justice solid drug-pushing, lady-pimpin "mob suckers who hooked her sister smaller in a state depraved, sick. Comments sociopolitical on the predicament of young black American is prominent in Coffy and makes some thought-provoking things become Coffy crusade against political corruption and racism of the white home advantage and acts as a parasite outside African-American minorities. Unfortunately, timely messages are undermined by the poor quality of the film and lack of focus. his ideas Coffy are important, but they are not targeted. One of the high points of Coffy is the presence icon Blaxploitation Pam Grier. Grier goes to her role with gusto and makes a heroine of appealing action, as she throws down arms in her often spectacular violent actions vigilance (how do you deal with a house full of hood?, drive your car right through the front door!). It's just a shame that the story revolves occasionally, losing time spinning as much sexual exploitation as possible. The reduced budget could not help but the fact that for a Blaxploitation film, Coffy does not have groove. As problems are undermined by the lack of quality, therefore, fun and excitement are also pierced by moments of dullness and misdirection. The total result is labor and wood. We have a hip heroin, but not a hip film. It's a shame that Coffy has his moments and should be rightly regarded as a key movie in Blaxploitation madness; never rises above a moderate number, warm.
