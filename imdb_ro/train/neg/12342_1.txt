Anyone familiar with my reviews of the database on the Internet will know that can be a miserable bastard at times. There are a lot of movies that I do not like, which, for an unusual reason, I felt the need to review. However, if someone there is curious to know the name of the worst movie I have ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without any question, this takes the time name no. 1 horrifying film. I can not believe I did it from the beginning of this clunker to the end! It is clearly meant to capture the flavor of Frank Brooks, "Young Frankenstein", but if the movie was a funny take on horror film traditions, this is a desperate and misguided attempt to overthrow the laugh of the material embarrassing weakness. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed to be here as a pair of modern Transylvanian journalists (they probably figured early that they were condemned to this mug). During their investigations, they come against all the boss monsters in the favorites of some terrible past, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. Anyone who manages to cure this film can even pray as a stake being condemned through their hearts to relieve them of agony of boredom. She marks a superior career for all involved and proves that when comedy fails in a great way, it results in terrible fun.
