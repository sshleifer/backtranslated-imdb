I saw this back in '94 when he was finally released. Apparently, because Orion's images were bankrupt, I think the movie was not released a few years ago. I have problems remembering my details, partly because I have not seen it for a long time, but I remember that it's a very boring film. We continued to debate whether to get out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaged. It was an American Graffiti imitation of the third installment. <br /> <br /> None of the shows deserve to be watched. One of the biggest disappointments from a local newspaper reviewer has given a high rating.
