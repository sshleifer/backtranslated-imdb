and not in a fun way to watch. it's bad. it is shocking that people posted positive things about it here. the story is shit, the act is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! the board has the hands that come out of it! oh gee - the mirror turned into water! hair, clothes and makeup in the '50s are not accurate and received a middle-aged man with a retired hairline to play the high school version of himself. it's like I was later the nightmare on the street gates. I like to sit down to watch a horror movie like anybody else, but the bad ones are better to choose.
