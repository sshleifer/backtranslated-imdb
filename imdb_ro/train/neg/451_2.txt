I do not care how many nominations got this junk for the best thing and that, this movie was embarrassed. I did not know whether to stop the set or to file a lawsuit with O.J. for illicit damage to my mental health. I rarely get bored; to call this fun for dung is a slap in front of any movie-goer on the planet. The whole story was bad, the act was uninspired, the "drama" was not excited. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unfulfilled experience.
