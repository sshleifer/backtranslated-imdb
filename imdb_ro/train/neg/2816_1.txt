This is one of those movies you see in the video store you just have to get because it just looks so terrible. And indeed, we could not take the majority. There was a bunch of fast redirects. But then I stepped into a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name has cast a little bit off my mind at this moment). Ouch. I have never seen a single scene in a movie so many times (we estimate about 40). And I've never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his thighs. I saw the movie a few months ago, but I can not help laughing when I write. Anyway, the scene is a photo-fitting - Englund's off the girl's underwear, Englund rides a naked horse and a mysterious woman dropping a snake's head. This is an absolute genius. You have to see it for yourself.
