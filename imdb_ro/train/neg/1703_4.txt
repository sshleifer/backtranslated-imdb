A veteran of Vietnam decides to take over a city in the war, and all who take steps in his way are eliminated (including women). Launched in theaters just before "A Star Is Born," which has transformed its career around, this action-drama mishmash with Kris Kristofferson is wild, extravagant, thoughtless and frightening. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are really futile, with red-hot clich√©s and mindless violence that make up most of George Armitage's script. Armitage gathered the most curious film of the 1970s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, in a way, Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is rude and rude all the way. It's worth thinking is a complete discomfort thriller, but bad vibrations (and ridiculous climax) cover the entire project as a nasty stain. * 1/2 from ****
