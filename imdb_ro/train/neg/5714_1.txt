I've seen many Korean Korean movies, including thrillers and darker movies, but that's grim. The director seems to be a sadic, who happened to make somebody produce junk. The movie has no entertainment value nor is it a thriller. I can not believe that someone really did such a movie. Even if the action is fine, the story line and the feeling it leaves is terrible. I'm sure I will not see any movie of this director. No sense of making the film, and a total disappointment in having thriller moments. All of this showed scenes with a psychopath that scattered the reels with shot scenes and showed more blood and violence, which makes them thrilling. The movie is very disappointing and I recommend recommending to skip all such films.
