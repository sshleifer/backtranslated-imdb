O.K. for the start, the taxi driver is amazing. this is not a taxi driver or amazing. what is is bad. but I thought it was kind of funny, which means she had some redeeming qualities. such as dialogue ... wow. it was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid and the movie was preached. there were some places where I thought the movie would be thrown into a type of violent taxi driver that would have hit the message at the end of the film much harder. I can not even believe there are 20 people who have seen this movie. yes, it is worth watching if you get bored and you want to reaffirm that anyone can make a movie or at least try.
