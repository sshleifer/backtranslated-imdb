Ouch. While Chevy Chase and the SNL band have set new highs with the sketch presentation format, this miserably fails at each level. Fortunately, Chevy is just in this situation and can not be blamed for this total farce. It's really very, very bad. While it was going to be a political commentary on the US at the time of its release (1974), it remains neither amusing nor noticed. The sketches are too long, and any satirical impact that they might have is lost as they are all drawn to the point of complete boredom. This is credited as the debut of Chevy's movie and I am delighted to say that everything he did has done better. Avoid even if you are curious.
