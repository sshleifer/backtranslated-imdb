A really unpleasant movie. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if they turn into a stomach), they do not have other redeeming features. Just like the movies of the '70s, it lets you feel like you should take a long shower and clean your slime. Characters are evenly unpleasant, and the plot makes no sense.
