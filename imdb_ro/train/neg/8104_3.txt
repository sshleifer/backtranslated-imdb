Yes, the film is an excellent example of how a collection of "deep" signifiers (political turbulence, love / lusts) can be combined haphazardly for critical criticism (see also "American beauty"). Kaufman's film is multiplying with free sex scenes, interwoven with often painful dialogue sequences (in one scene, we have three different accents of "European actors" affected by actors) and state posters may shortly be short but not binds in the coherent meditation offered by kundera. and in the three long hours he manages to almost glide on the franc, the fourth missing piece in the love triangle that is at the heart of the plot, sacrificing the central mechanism of the novel to show the spectrum of emotions and power relations which are obtained in the affairs of love. it also does not even include the token display time for Tomas's son, used in the novel to illustrate some of the political points that Kundera made in the novel. combined with the overworked soundtrack, these flaws make this film three hours insignificantly heavy in tone but easy to content.
