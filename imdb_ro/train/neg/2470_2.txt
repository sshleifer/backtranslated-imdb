I have seen many horror performances over the years, such as Nightstalker, which deals with Wendigo legend, so we were looking forward to an angry spirit that causes chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man was wrong. The entire movie creates this sense of events to happen, which will be scary and creepy, but then it will provide a simplistic story of revenge and murder over the loss of property. Scary ve-ery - no! This movie has much in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total miss. It's getting harder and harder to believe in what Hollywood puts in touch with scary movies because they rarely come across something original and scary. What idiots are paying for such a fake film? Turn to the drawing boards and do something useful with those millions of dollars you have to throw away.
