"Deadly Bear of Love" is essentially "fatal attraction" with a few twists added to the back half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week. There is still a cautionary story about giving up temptation and adding nothing to the genre. Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged in a beautiful woman who is going to have a pretty good trust fund. Even if he has everything, he risks losing everything, starting from an adventure with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a blonde of Cedar Falls, falls hard for Brett and does not take it special when she comes clean about her commitment. Shortly after the wedding, Ms. Brett returned to the main bedroom of the large and luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett, he immediately points his finger to Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to become more bitter in the next moment - not that she was the image of stability before. Her defense attorney (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is inclined to prove this. Did she do it or not? How will it end? You can find answers to these questions next time "Deadly Bear of Love" at the local station. And make sure you do not miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
