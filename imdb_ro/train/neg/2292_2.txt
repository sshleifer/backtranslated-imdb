First I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series far. I saw her when she was on TV. I did not realize it was a four season. In fact, it did not exist. BTAS ends season 3 and should have stopped there. Why they had to deal with a good thing. Catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. Joker looks beyond frightening, it seems that every time I review my look, he looks a whole lot more frightened. He does not seem to have pupils, and now he does not even look at the distance (though he is). Bruce Wayne is expressed by Kevin Conroy who makes the best batman. Though he now looks like a superman. There is nothing to divide it apart, because both looked the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. Wing Night needs a haircut, please! Alfred has only the pupils in the eye, looks more like a character in the 80's. We've watched three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and we've already found that this version is more violent and more graphic blood in each episode). If you are a fan of Batman: the animated series, there is no season of Batman 4. They included just this series as season 4 for marketing. If they just released him as Adventures of the new batman, I do not think he would have bought a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Save your disappointment and stay in the years 1-3.
