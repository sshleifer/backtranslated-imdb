Another film based on the tired and damp clich√© of the crazy scientist has become crazy. The film focuses around a surgeon whose ambition of life is to bring the dead ... back to life. I know, I know ... you never heard that before! Of course, as all these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniac creature thirsting with blood. For this promising configuration, you would think there will be at least a little suspension. Wrong. Like many movies in this era, the idea is enjoyable, but execution and script are mediocre. Not the worst horror film I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but none of the stones.
