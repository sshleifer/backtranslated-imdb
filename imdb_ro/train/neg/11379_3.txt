When I first saw a small scene in the ads, I thought the show would be fun to look at. The little robot looks pretty cute. The animation style looks familiar at some classic shows. Before diffusion, I studied it by some sources. There, I became slightly astonished. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are properly expressed, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been more enjoyable if he had been portrayed by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "What happened to Robot Jones?" The show is not bad at all. But the way Robotboy is presented inappropriately is my only criticism. So, I do not see much.
