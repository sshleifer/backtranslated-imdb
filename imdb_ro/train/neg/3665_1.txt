It seems like this happens when a director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite dialogue on the set, while he is allowed alcoholic in the meantime; as I said earlier, although I always wanted to grab one of Paul Naschy's werewolf images, this atrocities served as my introduction, and as terrible as it is and certainly I still intend to follow other serial entries, though very gradual. Despite some disappointments, such as "THE HOWLING" (1981) by Joe Dante, I like the images of werewolves in general, but frankly, I quickly lost interest in the "plot" of this film and I just stayed there my television screen counting her absurdities as they were. There were too many to mention here, but I have to say two that have kept my character extremely hilarious about the schizophrenic character of the Werewolf character (for example, going from an anger in a single blow to a a single blow in a zombie state, the next - as if it were a casual midnight walk in the locality, and it would be a different wardrobe ... and yes, I knew the reasons for that in advance), as well and "Phantom Of The Opera" the Wolfstein character! But what I know - maybe the long-lasting evasive version of this disaster could well have been a classic bona fide horror classic!
