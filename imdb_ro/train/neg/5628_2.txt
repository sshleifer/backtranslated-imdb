I'm not an artistically inclined individual. I'm a scientist woman and I felt that this movie was probably one of those campy artyy movies with a budget. I looked at some of it with my fiancé and my future daughter. We've tried a lot to find something in this movie to keep our interest. My fiancé and daughter voted her and I went to Ocean 13, but that's another story. Not to discourage me, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started to watch the movie seriously. I did not realize, I thought of taking it. I thought the strangest part was spitting the ashes and urns finding a place near the fireplace used as a vase for what looked like dead flowers. Interesting and yet had dead things inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe so they followed, but I will not be cheated the second time!
