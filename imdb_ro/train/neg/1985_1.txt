costumes, dialogue, historical precision are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and hanging scene. Shaiba was exact (as I could say), but that kind of feathers breaks the person's throat. Mrs. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope without serious effects until the rope has been shot. This guy did not strangle the person, killed them at the end of the fall. And just before entering a bank (in a flashback), they stop in the street a group hug - with the bandage hiding their faces - which would have been obvious to street people. Poor editing-that is, a battery under that shirt, and it's obvious that the "long walk" clip shows that they are traveling along the road, then reverses the movie. I liked the fact that they kept the scene with the horse that took a shit - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was stupid.
