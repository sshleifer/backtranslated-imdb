We had to go to a meeting, so we started the DVR to record the end. When it's over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have an idea?" She shook her head. I said, "So you made me look at the end of the movie and I do not know what happened." He did not "do" me, but you know. The body of the film itself was pretty good. There was a lot of suspense. He asked you to ask. Then came the end. The end was ... and just finished. You did not let yourself know what happened or why. Even before the credits seemed to me something would happen to explain, but it was never. So I came here waiting for someone to realize and I did not look. Not. Here, four years later, I am as devoid of one as the mason. I have no idea what happened. I'm glad I did not waste any $ to buy it, for sure it would have been upset. Ohhhhh! I understand! The end of the movie is what's gone! ROFL
