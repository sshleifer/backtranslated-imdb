This soap opera, "Knots Landing," has all the fun to get caught in a lift. Each episode contained plots such as rape, killing, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, not very different from the plots of other dramatic performances of the period. As for distribution, I saw several actors on a grain box. From the mid to late 1990s, "knot" reps crushed U.K-Gold as a mildewing diaper mountain. I regret to announce that I must suffer because my mother was a great fan of the show and would have been religious. Although since then the re-runs have been few and very far between (we hope to stay that way). The only positive thing that can be said about "knots" is the song of the saxophone, which was later used as title music for the I.T.V sitcom, "The Upper Hand". A great heritage, right?
