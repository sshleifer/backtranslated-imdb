Seriously. I just finished the first view of Demonicus, and my words failed. I remember a moment when I saw Charles Band's name on a movie, and my heart would have been watching me. There has never been a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. It was a bastion of hope for the little one. The guy whose videos arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they were still agitated more than most of the fashion junk that we would otherwise have to bear. And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A Californian Walking Trail lasts for the Alps twice, and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be an 'old cave'. I mean, they did not even try to clothe things with moss or shoot it in a way that suggests it was nothing but an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a frightening demoniac gladiator, as the cover looks like, we are treated to a guy who wears the newest apparel in Wal-Mart Halloween. There is a rather cold body that occasionally comes back to life twisting and rubbing his fingers, but he does not even learn to stay in the last five minutes. Why could not he be the bastard? Instead, we have Brother Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such a curse. I like movies so bad they are good. Damn it, I occasionally enjoy such a bad blow that it's bad. This, however, is only undiscovered. A perfect example of making a buck, rather than making a quality movie.
