This movie proves that you can not judge a movie through the wonderful works on the DVD cover. You also have to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone for Christmas). The beginning of this film actually looks somewhat promising. Well, before you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack brings the college co-eds a book full of witch witches that they leave in their haunted house every year (where the movie takes place). After that, there is some drinking porn, fighting and soft pornography. Then the action of the movie takes place after over an hour. Generally, Hallow's end was predictable, insensitive, and reminds of a soft core porn. This movie is probably best seen with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, because it's a good movie to have fun. And for viewers for the first time, it's really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
