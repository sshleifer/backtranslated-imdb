This was the worst movie I've ever seen at WorldFest and it also received the least applause afterwards! I can only believe that he receives such recognition on the basis of the number of actors known in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's just in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than allowed. The rest of the act is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main person is totally inappropriate and therefore a cellar to be watched. There is no real emotional depth for the story. A movie that revolves around an actor who can not get a job does not feel too original to me. Not even the development of the police. It feels like one of the many straight-to-video movies I've seen in the 90's ... And not even a good one in these standards. <br /> <br />
