Sometimes a premise starts well, but because of the requirements to cross overboard to meet the demands of a public suffering from attention deficit disorder, it becomes incongruous. And for three respected actors who have done better work before and after, this is a mortal shame. See. Premise: A loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad policeman. Interesting to say at least. Make the embedded policeman a bit disturbing, why not. It was well done in the hands of ROCKS CRADLE and ONE WHITE PUBLIC, and it's a proven track record for a successful thriller. Now, here's the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring a real threat to its main characters, never going so much as to look ridiculous or throw any similarity with the reality and the shock factor and make this cop so extreme - the variety of other super-villains who have hit cinemas of silent age. Manufacturers and directors chose the latter. Thus, the resulting film - made stupid, with the actors trying the boldest to make heads or queues in roles they had written before, and nothing more even less.
