What a shame that a truly competent director like Andre de Toth, who specialized in slippery and slippery alliances, failed to understand this concept first. It could have helped to highlight the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop. As the movie stands, it's pretty much a mess (as Chipe magazine said). The main problems are with the direction, the cheap budget and the poor scenario. Power consists of an excellent distribution and an interesting general concept - characters drawn in different directions of conflict forces. What was needed was someone with a vision sufficient to bring together the positive elements by reorienting the scenario into a coherent ensemble instead of the strange, messy mess that is (trying to figure out motivation and interaction if you can). Also, a larger budget could have matched contrasting locations and studio photos and would have reached the LA outskirts. The real shame consists of a loss of an excellent cast - Hayden, Taylor (before being covered with teeth), Dehner, Reeves, along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their premature death. Several films illustrate the importance of a car-with-vision more than this weak Western Western, which, in his right hands, could have been much more.
