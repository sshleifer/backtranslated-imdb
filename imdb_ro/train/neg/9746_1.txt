I remember this film, exhibited in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week. Although it may seem unbelievable and can not provide any explanation for this film, this film has been exhibited in a theater dedicated to ... art and high quality films (which is, for example, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... The Man Designed). Few people have seen it (lucky people, no doubt) and no reference to this very boring SF film is in the Peter Nichols Encyclopedia of Science Fiction or the author of the original novel. Very informative. I remember this after all these years, a storyless story, a lot of special effects that actually seem to be ridiculous and no longer. It seems that in some countries the operating time is 90 mm. and in another 77 minutes. Well, it means just a little more pain.
