Ummm, please forgive me, but have not lost more than half of the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a closed man for 19 years because he stole a loaf and then tried several times to escape. He breaks the passwords and is constantly pursued by police inspector Javert. There are many characters along the way that were not in this version. Some worth mentioning are Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character of the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the movie, trying to see how it was in any way related to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
