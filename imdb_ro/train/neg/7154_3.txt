This movie has all the insignia of too many chefs who have ruined the stew. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that powers that might not have left themselves alone. They could not decide whether this was Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much he should pedal out loud, whatever the story would have been. So a movie that could have been a story about two fascinating characters (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Mrs. Graham) becomes a desperate telenovel soap opera about what tells us a little about them. Added to this there is absolutely no time to feel anything other than for 1959. The clump scene follows the clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how long it passes. Still - and that saved my movie - Kerr never showed it nicer, and Peck is always a very beautiful man. They really make a beautiful and mature couple and just want to have a better material to work with. There is a scene that does not work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunk state, and to see these two normally refined stars, beat each other, is very disturbing and offers a passing idea about what happens in a relationship like theirs. Apart from this, the film is a wasteful opportunity and does not touch the classic stance of other soaps produced by Wald from the 1950s (PEYTON PLACE, BEST OF ALL).
