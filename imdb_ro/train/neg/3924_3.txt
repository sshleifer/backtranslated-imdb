The movie really terrible, pretentious, endless. Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the face and cute image of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, maybe he should have focused his attention more on making a good and exciting film. I hate it when a sex movie poses as "art film" just to become more "respectable". The most common occasional sex scenes are the only reason for this movie. Whether it's worth sitting in the rest of the picture, it's just a matter of taste. (*)
