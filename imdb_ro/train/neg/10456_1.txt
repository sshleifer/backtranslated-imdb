I would give a negative rating if I could. I entered this movie without waiting, but I had an open mind. Everything is stupid! The snakes are obviously false and the first two things they bite are a boob and a johnson boy. Oh how original; if I were a 12-year-old boy, I could laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I did not have fun, it was not funny, I was not bored! I was nothing. It was not even so bad that it was good, it's bad. Ridiculous in fact. Do not waste money on this movie. Do not even rent this movie. You do not know how to get such a high rating.
