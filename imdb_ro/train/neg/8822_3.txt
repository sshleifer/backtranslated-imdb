Depending on your own personal status when watching this, "bad christmas" may turn out to be an ambitious or innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and angry holiday blades with the holiday theme they've done ever. Personally, I'm tempted to choose the latter because I did not bother to do any research, and I just anticipated a brunette and anxious slasher from the 80s, with a wedding costume in the middle, a Santa Claw suit that slaughters people. Wrong! The film actually deals with a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage toy factory and thinks it's his responsibility to establish Christmas Eve that deserves gifts and deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he was Santa's witness? his father in an obvious suit? she caressed her mother's naked feet at an early age. After that, he has just developed into a social surplus, very much to the irritation of his younger brother, who is forced to make a day (holi). I fully understand why some fans appreciate this horror movie slightly eccentric but really must be so boring? There are some too long and seemingly endless parts of the movie, where absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the difficulties of gore and shedding blood, but this film does not even benefit from an anxious atmosphere or unexpected upheavals (except the notable final, I have to admit). I would also take the more serious concept if the crazy protagonist will focus on the lethal punishment of naughty children! He does not kill only the bad adults. How should you seriously take a controversial and original Christmas thriller when Santa does not even commit a miserable crime for children? That would have made "bad Christmas" a classic, while now it's just a junk of negligence and pitiful junk.
