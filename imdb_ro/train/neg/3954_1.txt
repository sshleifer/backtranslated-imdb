The full movie is flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie, as well as, inexplicably, pictures from other Brainwaves from Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love. She is framed with some more current images (since the early 90's), who are boring, badly shot and shot cheaply. Not only is the film almost completely retrospective, but repeating the same flashbacks throughout the movie. So, you see the recycled movies again and again, as if you had not already seen them. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen a movie so padded ... Someone has milled the last dollar in these movies. Total Riff. And let's talk about stuffing ... why do I have to write 10 rows about this trash? If I can say it's two-fold, it should be enough.
