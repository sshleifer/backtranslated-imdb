This movie was horrible. Scripture is completely unrealistic, but is written to take place in the real world, editing and lighting effects are more serious than most film school projects. I do not recommend this movie to anyone: A) knows details about the police world or undercover operations. B) I know any detail about filming or appreciating the movie. I recommend this film to medium or sub-medium minds, I think it would be nice if I were a dumber. If you have to watch this movie fully, I recommend a kind of hesitation. It is a total loss of low production value.
