VAMPYRES Appearance: 1.85: 1 Sound Format: Mono A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured into an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and gets stuck in their lifeless lifestyle , but his hosts prove to be vampires with a frenzy for human blood ... from the Lesbian vampire cycle, initiated by Jean Rollin in France and reinforced by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, "VAMPYRES" suffered much further from the concept of Horror for Adults than they were prepared for by British censors tolerate in 1974, and its film was reduced by almost three minutes on the original British version. It's hard not to understand why! Using the Gothic theme as a pretext for how much nudity, sex and bloodshed, as Larraz's short film will allow, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a simple context for a meditation on life, death, and impulses - sexual and other - which asserts the human state. Shot on the spot in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, Harry Waxman's film provokes a predatory atmosphere, in which the desolate rural area - solemn and beautiful to the same extent - seems to pretend to be a dreadful horror (Larraz shot a similar trick at the beginning of the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller erupting in a frenzy of violence during the drum final. However, despite his claims, the thin VAMPYRES plot and the hard production subjects will divide the audiences from the beginning, and while the two female protagonists are as attractive and appealing as desired, the male leadership (Brown , at the time of filming) is a great misery in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twenty-year-old studios. An element to be seen for cinema fans, a funny curiosity for everyone else, VAMPYRES is a well-received taste. Watch out for Bessie Love in a short cameo at the end of the movie.
