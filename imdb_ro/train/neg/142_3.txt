First of all, there are some good things about this movie, but all are cliche stuff combined with a teenage film. In the publicity of the movie I saw, a particular emphasis was placed on the fact that Denise Richards is in her, but she is a poor actress and is not as good as people who try to make her (not that has something to do with the movie). And what about the look he gives to everyone? Maybe he's part of the character, but, as I said, the actor ... Still, writing is fine. You know who's all over the movie and you can almost anticipate what's going to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book on which it is based is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I will read the book to find out rather than to follow it.
