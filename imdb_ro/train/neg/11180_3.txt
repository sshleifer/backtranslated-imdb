The only good thing about "The People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of the movies Al Pacino should avoid to play. The first big stop I had was the way Pacino tried to point out Georgia; sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too overburdened. Dialogue and interaction with the characters were terrible along with a weak plot. The cast that has done has done an extremely shallow work in keeping the film interesting and in less than an hour we have not yet seen signs of robust plot. The whole story is a real boredom and I had to hit myself several times to wake up. This movie will surely carry you and so ... avoid at all costs.
