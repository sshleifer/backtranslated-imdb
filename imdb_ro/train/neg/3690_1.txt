Baba-Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused his fall. It was launched with a lot of hype, but it collapsed badly and was put to serious financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to reimburse them personally for the losses suffered. Shortly after his release, he tried to venture into politics, but failed to hurt himself. It's a very bad movie, horrible action, bad quality make-up and pathetic scene. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from a certain illness. I am one of the unfortunate souls who have seen Baba, the first show on the first day in the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before flashing. Sorry, I will not recommend it to anyone.
