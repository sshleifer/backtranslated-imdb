I think this film is one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I can not remember anything for 20 minutes after the movie is over, it even drives me to write a review on it. Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was a joker. # 5 attempted to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, practically. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add suspense and scare. Because of nightmare 5: The dream child is neither fun nor frightening. What we do is actually a boring film with ordinary bad actors (maybe except Lisa Wilcox). The plan (Freddy killing Lisa's friends by using the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) has a good but not enough 90-minute film. Sometimes the story gets very confused (maybe because it does not exist) and you can not ask what filmmakers want. The script should have had more holes than Swiss cheese and the film was therefore very cheese in itself (let me say I do not like cheese, even if I'm from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as in the fourth part. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to rent / buy this movie, if not for exhaustiveness, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used, # 6 is also a messy one ...)
