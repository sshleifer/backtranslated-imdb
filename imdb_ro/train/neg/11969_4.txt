If you like to be entertained, do not visit this movie. If you love seeing the heroes of the war, do not go see this movie. If you like to see good acting and an excellent script, do not visit this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war movies that end in time just to give the public a political appeal about the greatness and glory of the war, visit this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I'm always interested in war films because I think if they do well they can learn something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of the war. This film shows a bunch of boys running in the countryside, saying whorlble clique lines, making the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the exact same force and brutality they gave to the oppressed. This movie is a shame of the film and the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person in Europe or Africa or any other country and look at this, being said that really are the Americans? No wonder we all hate us! Please, please, do not waste your time with this piece of junk; if necessary, wait and rent. 4/10
