If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and shows, you'll recognize some of the jokes made in this oddity. Written as a sitcom, this movie fails to hit any kind of chord, from the self-help doctor playing the sexy liver, as Molly Shannon was cut, to "I'm fat and therefore funny" John Linette. The five wives themselves are quite pleasant and, if this was done as a pilot for a series of action-adventure, it could have worked. Instead, it seems like a male fantasy that tries hard not to be politically incorrect.
