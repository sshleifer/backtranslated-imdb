A Cinderella story made for adults who live in the dream area. Romanticism is very unrealistic, flutter, love dovey, perfect, etc. The Cinderella statue to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a love story with a twist, it's certainly a movie, but for the rest of the real world, I'd recommend saving three hours of viewing time. Wake up! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the movie with me would not recommend the movie. We had a lot of fun with most unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something .. I just can not believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!
