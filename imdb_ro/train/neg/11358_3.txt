When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was presented at a 4D attraction (you know, the attraction that places do). I think the version I saw was a short version (15 min.) And also re-created to add motion effects. It was a nice movie ... but that was it. It was educational and he said about the first mission, but the conclusion of a CWI Spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... cute. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first month of walking. I will say, the characters of the character were well-chosen, and the characters themselves were pretty. So, all this, I'd say, if you want to bring the younger kids ... go for it. But if you want to get your older kids, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
