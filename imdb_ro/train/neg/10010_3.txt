The plot is not worth discussing, even though it describes corruption, crime, power, and other thriller-related issues. Characters are interesting though sometimes. It's not realistic, but interesting, though. Development is slow as the tea drinking ceremony. The video is not amazing, but good enough to lighten the eye strain. Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexpirator. The sitcom movie. I liked Woody - great performance. He had to fight against the inappropriate plot and did the job pretty well. The rest is bearable, though very predictable. The whole is visible and better than most TV shows.
