My favorite part was when the credits began to roll. I'd like to give him a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really want to have that hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste money or time on it. I really could see that the grass grew and felt better after the sections. Nadia was really beautiful and I hope the movie would not destroy her career. But she chose to be in it. Everything sucks more than any other film sucks. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That says something. <br /> <br /> Do not <br /> <br /> that !!!!
