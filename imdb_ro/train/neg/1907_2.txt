This terrible piece of garbage manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic at once, while pretending to be extremely chic and sophisticated. Atrocious performances, a clandestine scenario and boring directions make this film a movie that needs to unfold. Two scenes were particularly offensive - the one in which Schaech scrutinizes his tongue after being kissed by another man (maybe even so brutal) and the scene in which Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who pretends to be Russian. After leaving the room, she calls out "royal strangers"! So much to be a culture artist dreaming to live in Paris !, Jonathon Schaech can be a good actor on the screen and is amazingly good. It's a shame he did not learn more from working with the late-gay gay director Gregg Araki on a previous film and trying to save this movie from descent into a series of homosexual stereotypes and a homophobic villain.
