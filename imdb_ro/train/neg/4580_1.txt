I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I have ever seen - A very troublesome thing with this movie is that real scientists are being interviewed, but their footage is edited to show as if would support the ideas of the many scientists who populate this film. The BS-signal of interviews is about ten thousand to one - in the end, the interviewees seem to say, "We want you to think!" But they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on the things they actually claim. If you feel open and want to expand your consciousness, please be open enough to read some books on quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe," Nigel Calder (a thin volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can not bring up a book, please do not complain to reviewers about being "open." To review this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <Do you know what is a very good movie that questions the nature of reality? "The Thirteenth Floor," directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, challenging thinking.
