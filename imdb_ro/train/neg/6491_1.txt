This movie was a complete loss of time. I have watched this movie with a group of movie enthusiasts, who have a varied taste in movies and also a charming eye for a "genius" work, my colleague commentators on this site had the misfortune to label this pile of steam?); none of them found a single redeeming quality. I finished the movie with a shame of exhilaration. I will not repress here. I can only guess that the positive reviews offered here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, himself. However, as one of those commentators tells you, did he finance the film alone? because no one else in Hollywood or elsewhere in the world would risk a single ban or a good name in association with this movie. Do not let the semi-famous actors appearing in the film lure you in his clutches? as Christian Slater admits in the special features of "doing" he signed on the film without reading the script or knowing any details (a madness I'm sure will never repeat). I am sorry for the misfortune of an individual who is impeded in this curse of self-indulgence written, directed, produced and financed by a man too famous to admit that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please Google "Anthony Hopkins" AND art).
