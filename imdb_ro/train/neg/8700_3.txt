I really hope Concorde / New Horizons do not try to make a serious horror or even a movie action when they did Carnosaur 3. The film is silly from the beginning to the end. Even humor in C3 is fun, because it's bad. Certainly a large water mark in the "so bad is good" type. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, it is for you.
