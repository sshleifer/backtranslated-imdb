Kirsten Dunst is terribly overestimated as an actress. You can always say that it only "works". I like Izzard though. The plot is terribly boring. The visitor has no real connections with the characters, without knowing who to really feel or even take care of. Slowly, boring, with some laughs, but little and very funny. Plot is not hired or suspended in the smallest. You can see every turn coming a mile away. What should this film be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You will not get to the end of this movie.
