When the memory of childhood tells you it was a scary movie; touch it and go if you should review it. Anyway, I remembered a frightening scene that involved a homeless person and a frightened villain played by Jeff Kober. "The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It is full of those policeman clich√©s and a very poor script with holes a truck can drive (along with countless "twists" that help the story unfold). Lou Diamond Phillips is a bad cop who sends serious killer Kober into the gas chamber just to find out he's a devil of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection along with the power to possess any poorly thought-out person he comes over . By means of a very poorly accomplished psychic mixture that helps to the case. Ahhh, this is garbage. But pleasant as such, especially if you have pleasant memories about it. It scared me like a child, and that scene with the homeless is still pretty good. Regarding any logic here; look, almost every scenario is thrown to a good extent and you will get a cross between Steven Segal's action action and a 70-year-old demonic film. And who thinks on earth that it was a good idea to throw Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead? Needless to say that he is not at all convincing, but he tries everything that's best and I never had the problem with the guy that too many reviewers here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as a psychic, the less he said the better. But Kober is good enough as the killer; he always liked that actor. "First power" may be exactly what the doctor ordered after hard work and a "brain shut" is needed. Beer will most likely improve the viewing experience and I will definitely have a lot of her next time I give this movie a spin. Fully; not a good film, but some kind of guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were slightly scared as children. "See you here, buddy!"
