Twenty years ago, the five-year-old Michael Hawthorne assisted her father in killing her mother with an ax on an empty road and then on suicide. Currently, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites Peg's friend Stacy Grant and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson) Phillip Rhys and Trish Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with her grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest fear, and with his Indian boyfriend Crow (Byron Chief Moon) they will make an old Indian party using Morty wood carving (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate fears theirs forever. Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns to his father, killing his friends. "Fear: The Resurrection" is a disappointing and useless slash movie that uses the exciting concept of eliminating the greatest intimate fear of each friend before they grow, but in a clumsy dirty scenario. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the act is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation for the mannequin being brought to life; In addition, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or pain when each of them dies. The low rhythm of more than fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. Eventually, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested in what I did not notice along the story. I do not know if the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of operation. The special effects are very reasonable for a movie B. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: a Halloween night")
