You realize you're looking at EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing the aliens coexist on an island, but you think that after watching the unruly heroes shot by shame, dragging their belly with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get to engage in something more original (and exciting). And I'm not even talking about the validity of the show I find in question. It's hard to stop mistrusting the fact that "Bushy Bill" eats a rat when the entire crew of manufactures and roommates are housed in a bio-dome with air-conditioning temperature change, savoring mochinno moxy squatting. the call from here? I do not care about these people or their proud life. I just do not understand. But if you feel captivated by hairy and sleepless people, we suggest that you turn off your TV and take a trip to the local bus station, where you can see people of this nature in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and, for free, you can relax and linger in their ability to recover various scraps of cigarettes from a lot of garbage cans, eventually hitting "dirt" and making a cancer Dr. Frankenstein's origin to ask people to change their food when the smell of "Aqua Velva" in breathing is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Like the Survivor, every week a member of the tribe "Leaves" "Island" when they are sent without a prescription packing to the local institution when the terrible dissatisfied state of suffocating schizophrenia gives blows! Now, that's the fun!
