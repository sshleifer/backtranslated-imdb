I think Micheal Ironsides's acting career should end, if he has to play a role in this kind of nonsense. Of course he could do better than waste his time in this trash. This movie could be much better if it had a good budget, but it repeatedly shows the movie. There is a scene from an outpost, which seems to be outside the border of a train station, and I bet it was. There is a scene that made this movie 3 and shows the landing spacecraft and takes off over a lake surrounded by forests. This has been done well, but the rest of the movie, look at it. There is another scene that looks like an engineering installation that I bet, and it does not look like an outpost space as the character says it is. This movie is bad, has a seriously low budget, makes no sense, and God helps Micheal Ironsides.
