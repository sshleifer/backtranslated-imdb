Of course it's a comedy I will not forget for a while. Normally, I would not mind commenting on this movie: it's so minor that no one could look at it anyway, but as it happens is quite popular in p2p sharing networks, such as Kazaa, and so this saad production must be exposed for what it is. So what is it then? Of course it's not a comedy; Instead, it is intended that a blow of horror - "intentional" being very much the key word here. The scenario is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are just special in the fact that they are particularly pathetic, and in terms of acting, well, let's say if that was my graduation play in primary school, my teachers he broke into crying to our talent. Of course I realize that this is a very low budget film and that in these cases you should reduce your expectations, certainly with regard to special effects. Even if I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are rarely places to look for exciting scripts and top actors. <br /> <br /> But all. /> <br /> B-movies often have some redemption features to compensate for the lack of funding, such as humor. The only laugh from Cradle to Frica is in ridiculous shows. If you find the humor in this - and I could for the first 20 minutes or so, trembling gradually after that - then it will be the only thing the movie can offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. Woohoo, how interesting. As for the story, it does not even try to convey anything: victims either use drugs or are involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Take care, boys and naughty girls, because someday you will have to pay for what you did. I rested my case. <br /> <br /> Generally, a little bit of sex, a fairly large amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. I rated this 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I would not deserve it: it's only worth once to write the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, is that something in here?
