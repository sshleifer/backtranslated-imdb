I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because I think "Wongo Wild Women" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. There is certainly no action (though the shark has a quality dialogue). We ask nothing. We do not know how people arrived where they arrived. It's always amazing for me how to release things like this. I agree with the previous writer that it's not really funny. Know. It is about 90 minutes long and will fill up much space on a DVD collection. It's like a piece of paper. Or a bad painting you bought at a sale of hungry artists. Cover the crack in the wall.
