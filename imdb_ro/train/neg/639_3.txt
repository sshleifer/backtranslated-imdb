The cliché of a shocked soldier from the war is boring here. Mişto, a splendid distribution, acting on the limits of their high talents, can not redeem the "Return of the Soldier" from its rigid inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement. The best moments, as another commentator mentioned, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but not even Jackson's cinematic power can pull the chestnuts of this film from his cold hearth, never heated. Ann-Margret, her sexual cat reputation and too often accused of lack of acting, finds her real and profoundly lost skills here - despite talking with Middlesex, almost perfect. The back score, renamed by many minuses of the unprepared television miniseries, is emotionally touching in terms of the emotional distance of the scenario, blocking and overcoming the formalism of direction; except for his score and cassette script and direction, "The Return of the Soldier" has all the appropriate bits, but does not make them work together.
