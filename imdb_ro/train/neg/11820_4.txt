I have seen this on DVD (known as CORRUPT in this format), and the blur on the case really suggested how Harvey Keitel Frank's character is as much as the one that BAD LIEUTENANT interpreted in "This thriller polite ". What he did not mention was that this is an old Italian film. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music that he does not put on a CD player, he pulls out a big thing of plastic pancake, puts it on a sort of rotating hob, where a kind of mechanical arm touches pancake stuff that makes music to be heard. Do you see my view of this old movie? The DVD case did not give a clue that this was a movie made 20 years ago. It is also a film with poor production figures, like many other Italian films that behave like the American ones. With the exception of Keitel, the distribution is awful, although Johnny Rotten's interpretation is rather bizarre than terrible, the cinema is static, with a picture and sound quality, giving the impression that I was watching a copy of the fourth-generation pirate (I do not know if it's a slim DVD or a very bad movie) and the worst of all is Ennio Morricone's score. It is impossible to believe that the man who made the incidental irritating music for Corupt is the same as the guy who made music for Clint Eastwood's Westerners. All this is a shame because Corupt has moments. It's not the biggest psychotic thriller ever invented, but it has kept my interest and, as always, Keitel behaves well as a violent cop. Just a shame, the rest of the film did not match its high standards
