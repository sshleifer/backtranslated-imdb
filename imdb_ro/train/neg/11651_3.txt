Considering that this film was put together in less than a year, it could explain its shortening (81 minutes - including final credits, so about 76 minutes of real movie). But what she can not explain is the lack of humor the previous movie possessed. Gags are fast and sometimes not funny. The only real funny parts are the quick spoofing of Nike basketball spots, the portrayal of James Woods of Max Van Sydow's character in Exorcist and the pieces scattered in the film. Very unfortunate was the removal from Charlie's angels, who, like the first Scary Movie and Matrix spin off the scene, recreated the scene without much humor injected into it. Young people today may not be able to refer to the espionage gangs of classic supernatural horror films of the '70s, such as the Exorcist and maybe the Poltergeist of the 1980s, et. al. <br /> <br /> We hope the Scary 3 movie will take some time to put together, making spoofs more enjoyable. One thing, however, the film has more than the last, promised young actress Anna Faris (which I will admit it was extremely hot still). Just for her talent to play and act, I give this movie a "3" of "10".
