This movie was so bad that I had to repeat the majority to get to the good bits. What's the good bit? the only thing that deserves to be the end (those who have seen the movie will know what I mean). I've been expecting a lot from this movie as a dead-face encounter with Freddy vs. Jason, but what we got was this shit. The story was forgotten, the distribution was badly used and what the director thought when he did that. That could have been a big one, but it turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever watched. So, if it were a bit beautiful of T and A, I was after the gore and I was bitter disappointed. Do not expect a good movie, but if you want a bad horror, then watch this carefully and see how a horror movie should not be done.
