Though I never like to be a kind of person who deny someone else's taste; if you like something, it's good. But this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I do not like much Difneco, but she's a great guitarist and composer I can admit. But I can not recognize the existence of redeeming qualities for this film. Many people have said it is an accurate representation of the problems faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is portrayed too much. There seems to be a try for a "Gun Naked" - a sort of essential comedy, but the timing is stopped; there is too much space between each line of actors, as if laughing (there was none). Who wrote the script was everywhere. They have tried to gather as many controversial issues together in a film, almost never developing any of them (especially the girl who was impregnated by a teacher). I did not laugh at all for the whole movie. I was too offended by this attempt of humor and satire to do anything but move my eyes on the screen.
