Swayze does not make Alan Quatermain very convincing. Compared to Stewart Granger; who grew up in my last hero in films such as "Scaramouche" in 1952, "Zenda Prison" in 1952 and "King Solomon's Mines" of 1950; Patrick Swayze totally fails. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was very good on a bigger flop. Also, Alison Doody does not have the grace of Deborah Kerr as the lead lady and last but not least, the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it hard for anyone to fill their shoes! For someone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I strongly recommend you not to get your hands on the granger version.
