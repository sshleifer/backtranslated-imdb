If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 on a used manual, not this movie. I'm a little worried that the money I spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. I do not think directors really have a point of view, but they seem to have tried to do more: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our lives are deterministic ; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is just as cold, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a hard-to-watch role and 7) here, put this little square paper in your mouth and you will see some really groove things.
