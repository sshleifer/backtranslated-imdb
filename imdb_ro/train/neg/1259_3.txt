Thank you, Hollywood. However, another classic movie ruined by a cheap, superficial, powerful and redundant remake. The original "The Planet of the Monkeys" was an intelligent and challenging film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which seems very boring, but really very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to have disappeared with almost all dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour movie. Dialog has been reduced to a minimum, interaction and character development are non-existent, and often it is extremely difficult to figure out what's going on. Instead, we have a lot of unnecessary action scenes, funny marginal fun lines, and very quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing to note about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The size of the monkeys is magnificent, and the sets and the background are beautiful. However, this does not distract from the fact that "The Monkey Planet (2001)" is a very superficial and simplistic film, full of thin characters, a stupid dialogue and an almost nonexistent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop destroying the great movies, turning them into a meaningless blockbusters. Oh, yes, the end did not make any SENSE. , mainly for visuals <br /> <br />
