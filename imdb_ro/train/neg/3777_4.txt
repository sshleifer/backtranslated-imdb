Computerized images without a soul on a less amazing background animate a horrible predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even say when Bryan Adams' voices will come, which are always at the wrong time. The main character, the Spirit of the horse, gets annoying when telling what's going on. The narrative is not necessary, because everything that happens is very obvious. You can even say what the horses say, though everything they do is close. Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for pain, one for laughter, etc. There is no variation between horse voices. like this movie, though. It's pretty bleak for a family to sit down and look, and it's a little dangerous for someone to be frightened. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. Otherwise, this is not recommended.
