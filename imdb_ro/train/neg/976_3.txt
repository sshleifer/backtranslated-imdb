Generally, I'm more willing to be open to rom com than many, but it was not a very good test. It has nothing to do with the British original - they have not seen, and I doubt I will. She has a lot to do with a meandering plot, the lack of chemistry between leads and a performance / godawful character from his alleged male (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon's going to the screen wearing clothes and hairstyle for 15 years and acting a decade younger than that. He should be a teacher you see and, of course, his well-known, school districts around the world love to hire less mature people than the children he intends to teach. The character is so disturbed and irrational that I have doubts about the fact that any actor could have done it, but old crews such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler could have kicked him. Not Fallon, who's neither fun nor actor, but he seems to think he's both. Not once throughout the movie, you think of Fallon in his role or do you think there is any way that these two people should or should be together. Almost at the end of the film there is a scene where Barrymore (who was as cute as usual but could not bear it alone - hard to have a one-person story) tells Fallon that it's over, too much and moved on. And rather than feeling sorry about the scene or sorry for Fallon, you are actively interested - in the end, she does what she should have done months ago. But, of course, the mechanics of the plot will not allow it to be the end of it (a purpose that could have made a statement of this misery), and in return we will come to see a rational career girl throwing everything away to follow after this childish idiot and encourage his illusion. Of course, it had to be crazy and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusting than anything else.
