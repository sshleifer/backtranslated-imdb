The man the end of this movie is so terribly indescribable and dated that my entire aesthetic film class laughed like mad. Now most of the movie was fine. He had some unusually funny scenes, but he had some good photos and editing. Yes, Alderich is a great director who made FLIGHT OF THE Phoenix and everything happened to Baby Jane, among others. The problem is not with direction, action or anything else technical. The film is destroyed only in the third act. Why? Killing, twists, transformations and characters have all changed around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the fuck did the writer smoke when he came up with this? The way it just comes out of nowhere can be the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's monkeys' planet, the life of David Gale or Notorious, I think this is the worst finality of all time. What he got down.
