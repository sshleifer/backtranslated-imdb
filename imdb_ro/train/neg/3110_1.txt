I usually come to this site before going to the movies, because I like to see what others think about the movie. I've read many reviews that said "thriller not a horror movie". This made me try this movie. I really have to face these "thriller / horror" statements because there was none! I almost went and asked for my money back, and if many reviewers enjoyed this garbage ... well, you have to be easy to please! At the end of the movie, the people behind me told me aloud "what waste of time" and I turned to them and said, "I could not have summed up better." I waited for something to happen ... but no. There was the potential for many good spirits (or emotions if you want), but nothing happened. Williams acted quite well, but I felt he was short, changed by a poor scenario, who muttered and did not go anywhere. Save your money, this is a turkey that will be presented at a DVD store "bargain box" near you in the very near future!
