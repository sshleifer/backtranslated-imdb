Unlimited science fiction from Kerry Conran, for which this is clearly a love work. Unfortunately, it's not so good. It all starts pretty well - with an epic but limited score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and a glossy cinema of a Spielberg. The film also covers many science fiction novels, series and films as diverse as Earth Day has still been, Superman, Metropolis, Monkey Planet, Iron Giant, Secondary War and Spy Who Loved Me. The film, however, fails to be as good as any of them for many reasons: the main being is that it is a love force so preoccupied with throwing everything on the screen and creating a new courageous world, Conran actually forgets make a movie. There is not much tension, atmosphere or magic here, despite aerial fights, dinosaurs and racing sets against time. Even the elements of the noir collapse. This is a great way to look at things though - those elements generally fail because nothing feels real and is so obviously false - the green screen only looks like a half-time video game and it is obvious that the actors were subsequently pasted. Actresses have no reason to do it anymore - Jude Law is made of wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and all because of a terrible scenario - the genre that has to explain almost everything. It is a decent experience, and some may feel nostalgic, but ultimately this is a useless step in the world of yesterday. A pleasant ending.
