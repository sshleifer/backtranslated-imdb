I saw this movie first to see Brooke Burke (like Jill), whom I met briefly at LA at a modeling show in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but I thought she played her role very well. Since it is such a beautiful and pleasant host and television model, it was not surprising. I was wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe we lost it. I was not very sure about this movie, and although I liked the actors, I felt like it was for a public college. I tried to keep an open mind, considering that horror was not my favorite, but I felt I was over the throats. He seemed to go in some places, let you guess in certain places about the powers the bad teacher had and, like many other films, have an unsatisfactory end. After writing a few scenarios, I know that many of these are difficult and they can get personal opinions, how many movies you've seen and studied and those you referred to at a time. <br /> <br /> In short, I was interesting, but it was not a satisfactory plot and ended up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would eventually come back through the portal and kick everyone, which would be a satisfying ending and gain a higher rating.
