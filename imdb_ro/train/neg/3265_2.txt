I have no idea what director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-the-disease. With Redd Foxx in the role of central and sufficient pimps and polyester suits to carpet the entire 1970s, Norman plays as a picture of blaxploitation combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comical misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning how their son is secretly gay - and living with a gay white - jokes written to ruin any episode in "The Three Company". Bailey retains his dignity, and Foxx's pure confusion is good for some chuckles, but the other performers are humiliated. * from ****
