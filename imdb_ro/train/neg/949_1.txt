I never understood the appeal of this show. The action is poor (Debra Jo Rupp is a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are sad and uninspired, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are not working, and it is painful to try to stay even half an episode. Moreover, the connection between this show and the '70s is extremely difficult beyond the style of clothing and the landscape and background used for the show - it does not seem to be anything but a modern sitcom with the same old, non-functional and clich√© scriptures, which modern sitcoms have dressed in a show of twenty years ago, hoping to win some nostalgic spectators or something. Both "Happy Days" and "Wonder Years" use the same technique much more efficiently, and it's actually a pleasure to look in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show
