As a true fan of Elvis, this movie is a total embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The film opens with the beautiful "Stay Away" son, and the Grand Canyon landscape gives the spectator hope of something special. Elvis is on stage and his talent is lost long, especially in the rest of the songs he has presented. I stayed twice in this movie, just to make sure it's a piece of junk! 1 of 10 !!!
