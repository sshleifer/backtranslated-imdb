This Hitchcock movie does not have much similarity to its suspense movies later, and it seems much like a very old morality story. A young couple receives an inheritance that I think will make her happy. They spend money traveling around the world and live a hedonistic existence. However, after a while enthusiasm begins to fall and the couple becomes dissipated and useless in their existence. However, if they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and ending much happier in the end, because they now appreciate life! What an unusual, stupid and sermon movie! Personally, I would like to inherit all this money and find out if it makes me miserable! Production values ​​are relatively weak compared to later productions - a tough film with poor sound quality and rather amateur acting.
