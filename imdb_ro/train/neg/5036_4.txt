SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell Melissa, a desert town and not long before the people around her to die. The detective has to put clues together with his good daughter Nancy Drew, played on Friday, the 13th graduate, Dana Kimmell. Local American residents are the main suspects because they seem to suppress the injured people. These events lead to the revelation of the murderer at Melissa's sixteen-year celebration party. This average slasher is not very memorable. She has a TV feel, without much score, apart from singing the title character's own character, playing several times throughout. Lines such as the "killer will turn us into hunts". Stay in standard 80-year scenarios. Trademarks call Melissa a bad name, then somehow immediately develops a friendship. It seems Brands sees how hard it is to fit because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This movie would be hard to do today, with the main character being fifteen years old, and the director introduced several free of charge free admissions. The social commentary on the Indians has not been developed enough to be taken seriously. I'm too surprised by the pretty high rating of this movie. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's blood day had the potential to harness the honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense career success, but I feel I have not been able to deliver. But on the shining side that releases obscure movies like this on the DVD it gives hope that others will follow.
