This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; In later O'Leary, he was played by younger actors than Guy Kibbee. A group of relatives (all played by renowned actors) reunite in an old house, of course!) To talk with a rich relative who goes into a coma. While waiting to recover, all sorts of mysterious things happen, including some crimes. br /> <br /> A frightening film; worth seeing!
