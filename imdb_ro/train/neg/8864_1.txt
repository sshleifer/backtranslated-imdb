After I looked at this, I lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This has gone through time). This movie was a total garbage. First, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. Then he tries to turn him into a sad excuse of a pornographic movie with werewolves! Dad's sucks and the whole movie is just AWFUL !! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (From her point of view, she was SUSPECTED to be Dee Wallace Stone) joins Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be empty all the time. This is not worth even renting (unless you want to waste your time and money watching nudity.) Try to catch it by cable. It would be so cut, maybe it would make sense.
