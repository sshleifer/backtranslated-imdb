This ABC direct-to-TV failure has absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel, which is a Wrinkle in Time. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world like no author in front of her. This novel, the first in its "quartet of time", is a beautiful appearance of life, of the universe and of time itself. However, it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand. His unwavering morality is spread throughout the book. This adaptation of the film can only be seen as a mockery of Mrs. Engle's artwork. Honestly, what did they think? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is sore and uneven, the dialogue is removed and almost all of the magical features of the novel have been lost. It was a horrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day, an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) makes another attempt to bring this book to the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, cheap and cheap motel-room art, which has no role and has no impact on its audience.
