Almost the word, this film is poor and unconvinced, but again, most people would struggle to show their commitment to a scenario as uninspired. The dialogue really does not flow, and sometimes, in this case, more is less (or should have). This is also supported by weird scenes (for example, Cemetry slow-motion ride) that you think could take somewhere but only seem to lose a few seconds of your life. The land is a strange combination of gangster comedy / situation that I'm sure seemed to be a good idea at the time, but if there ever was a case for someone to be honest with the screenwriter, then he was here. Martin Freeman is fine but then he seems to have a character who always plays so I start to wonder if he was given a script or just filmed and told him to react as normal. Finally - humor. That reminds me of Python's quote about Shakespeare, his "comedies" - If he wanted to be humorous, he'd have a joke in it. Well, I did not see one. Do not waste your time - I did it because I followed a friend and hoped it would be better. <br /> <br /> It did not.
