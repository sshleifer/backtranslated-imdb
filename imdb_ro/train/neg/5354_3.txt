Lack of good plots, lack of decent action, absence of GOOD CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THE BOOK ... must I go on? Revision MAY contain SPOILS. The actors seem to read them, and not very well to that. Most of the "actors" behaved as if they were in a secondary game. The story seemed to have been written by one of the second-class students mentioned ... it's not that complicated ... it's so simple and DUMB that a person thinks something must be lacking so he thinks it's complicated . No, it's just how simple you think it is. I understand the "movie", so I know STUNK! Most of the film only had people standing around talking (reading their lines), trying to look sinister. The Narrator was YEAR. "Special Effects" were LAUGHABLE. I like low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... but not in this movie ... you can say that they do not pay or pay too much because their hearts NOR talents were in her. I LOVE Tony Todd ... however, he was only fit in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave him 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was just in him for a MINUTE DAY (seriously)! I would suggest to move forward the DVD on the two-minute segment Tony Todd. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a DOLAR to see this movie, I would have been P.O. D and I asked for my money back. We hope that people who have done so will do better next time.
