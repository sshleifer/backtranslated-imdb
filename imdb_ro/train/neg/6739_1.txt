One wonders why somebody would try to rebalance successful movie parks that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. "Wedding date" is one of the best examples of not trying to recreate, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been different. If such a project goes further with the approval of the big studio, then go with big stars and glossy production values, in this way people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's not what happens in this wrong test of comedy. The problem seems to be the way the screenwriters transplanted the story to London, when, basically, this situation seems to be a typical American situation that it will not even be able to fix it. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Because Kat and Nick have no conflict from the beginning, the spectator is not shot in the movie as the creators thought it would be. It is clear that Kat will fall for Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best activist in Junebug, meets like a superficial girl who is willing to keep her lie and not come clean for the man who loves her and will marry her. For someone interested, credits at the end of the movie run for almost seven minutes!
