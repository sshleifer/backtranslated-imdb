"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about "The Exorcist," I think. Seeing that the EVP is supposed to be true, indeed a light passage was a real dread. There are not many movies that incorporate fear into the minds of men. Like I said this movie could have, but it did not. The film degraded into a spooky film PG-13. Nothing compared to "ring" or "sixth sense" by any means. Someone has to deal only with the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. I am genuinely ill of the genre PG-13 Horror, because it has become a genre. We need the old days back, blood and gore days, by Freddy Kruger, by Jason, by Mike Myers. Some movies can think of this mentality so frightening. So why are you trying to eliminate it? Some good leaps in this film are nothing but one of the foolish endings in the history of the film without any resolution ... do not waste money in this movie.
