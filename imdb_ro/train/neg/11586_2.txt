A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Sleeping Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I like the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character in horror movies. But even if I'm a fan, I can not see that this film is mediocre. There is not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. So far they have just given up. Do not even try. They are the production of course, hoping for a few dollars easier. The story does not attract your attention. So simple is almost absent. Alice, a survivor of the 4th is now pregnant. Freddy returns through the child's dreams. At first we find out that to stop it, Alice has to find her mother. And that's it. The story is progressing slowly because there is so little plot that means it's pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and terrible actors. In fact, this is the only scary thing, the act, since deaths are not even cool. <br /> <br /> Characters are so uninteresting that we can not care less for them. Girls are just as unattractive. All the cast reminded me of an amateur theater group. I've seen actors better in school plays. It's really embarrassing. Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring a certain class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has a talent. But the material did not let it shine. What a shame. Stephen Hopkins's work is not nearly as close to Renny Harlin's brilliant direction in Dream Master. He's trying a few imaginative pictures near the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in previous films is not where he's found. The dream child is just a continuous continuation without sense. It's a kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end to Freddy once scary. It's too sad to see him now. A clown that is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
