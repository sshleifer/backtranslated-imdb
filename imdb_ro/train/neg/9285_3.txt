Since I felt like taking a new Jet Li movie to see some, but kicking and kicking without a fight, I got this title. Unfortunately, this film contains several gun battles (ah Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good) than Jet Li and the acrobatic fight of the company. So it was an escape. Fighting with the tap was interesting and even funny, considering it was totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, more on the line of Jackie Chan. > <br /> But unfortunately, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even Enforcer for this disappointment. Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall score of the movie
