First, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in place in a vampire movie. Together with other characters that are not so interesting and with the poor story, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you remember this and you are a fan of the total vampire movie, you can have fun with some scenes. Do not wait here for any Tarantino-style chapter and no story of Anne Rice. (I expect to have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow;)
