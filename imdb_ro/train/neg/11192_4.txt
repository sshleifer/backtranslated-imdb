I was not impressed with this movie. It was originally called Sin Eater and should have stayed that way considering that everything was said about the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the others. It was very slow and what was with the choice of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. Altogether, I would say that you check this if you are in things dealing with Catholic religion, but do not expect an Exorcist or Stigmata in this movie. Surely it will flop after a few days and the word will come out.
