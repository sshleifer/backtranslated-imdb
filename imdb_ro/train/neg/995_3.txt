Rosario Dawson plays the role of a girl who is raped and then begins to become decent in the dark until he is given a chance of revenge. Although it is clear why Dawson took over the role, a chance to show his chopstick and make a small independent movie, certainly a Hollywood movie, it's also clear that, apart from the amazing appearance, Dawson seems to be be in place of this role. Forgive me that I just could not find her. It's not a mistake, that's how I felt, I had no idea where it was. Yes, I know it's on the screen, but although I spent more than two hours looking at it, it left no impression to me. I blame the script for this, besides the end of it, not a lot of things that happened on the screen seemed to make any sense. The people seemed to be more posture than true, and what did not seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie, other than the end (which I would like to talk about but which I can not do, would hurt it) and Rosario Dawson's image as a picture What can I say, maybe I can give you a click, maybe not, it's time for me not to come back. Only for Rosario Dawson fans, though they are warned, there are several real reasons for this NC17. (And Rosario - please, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
