OK, so I saw the movie, although it appeared last year ... I thought it was a decent film, except the story, which was stupid and horrible ... First, we never get to know anything about creatures, why did they emerge if they do in our world and even have been on Earth before they were or just came from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is as obviously created ... Really, how large could be the subterranean substation? There were only so many creatures, so instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have planted some tactical bombs, or they could figure out a nuke and a Nuke to do their job. I know it sounds funny and it's, but I do not see people killing like NEEDS ... Third, Leon behaves like Superman jumping on the train and fighting with Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and taller. Then again, when he heads to the conductor, he does nothing and acts like an old man, watching all the abominations. Well, the conductor had a scruffy help (lol), but if Leon was so courageous, he would have gone all the way ... That means risking his life first, then doing nothing exactly when he should have. He could have died like a hero, but he lives like a coward ... it could be so, but not after showing so much gentleness ... Then the cop ... come on! It was a metro city, I bet there should have been other policemen, except the lady, other police stations, it was kind of stupid ... Overall, a great action by Vinnie Jones, an idea interesting to the reason behind what is not built at all ... By the way, what are the signs on the chest? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
