Slashs have come a long way and a few days ago, so when I heard about Cut, I had great hopes and heard good things about it. The good things I heard were wrong ... very wrong! This move is bad and I mean bad. It's just stupid. Everything about that. Especially the origin of the killer and the way he lives alive and how he ultimately cares. There is nothing original or remarkable about this movie. Just another slimer wannabe with those "Hip", "Self-conscious." The characters "Movie savvy". I'm sick of these crap. Someone does something different because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
