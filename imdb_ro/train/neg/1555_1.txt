When I decided to watch the barbarians, with those twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be so bad because the movie was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has the reputation of creating disturbing films, BARBARIAN is a a remarkable action / adventure film that wants to be another CONAN BARBARIAN, and fails at all levels. The appearance of the movie is wrong. Some scenes were well shot, but the tone and the amazing "disco" aspect of the garment and the hair are adorned simply does not make sense, even for a budget budget like this one. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with hairstyle and ridiculous costume. He should be menacing, but he meets like a bufon. And it's fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, to appear in her first movie, walking around fur bikini. I'm sure he wants to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are all right as mosquito heroes, but it is almost impossible to build a proper critique of their role, because their roles are, like anything else in this mess, really badly conceived. The only way in which the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is that it has one twin wearing a lining covering its butt, while the rest of the other twin only covers its muscular muscle. I'm not kidding! Do not ask who's who. Deodato must have been really desperate to accept this movie. And his desperation is perfectly reflected in this shot. They were.
