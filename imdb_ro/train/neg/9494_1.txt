The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire very much. The conductors had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second I could think it was deeper than the lust between them. The story did not sound real. Add to that embarrassing conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that practically does not lead anywhere, and you've made a real stinker. Kay Lenz's naked scenes might be useful for those looking for a small amount of money, but otherwise this is a colossal loss of time. My thoughts, as I watched the movie, was that it would have been better called "Cheesy."
