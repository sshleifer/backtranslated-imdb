I have to say that this was the worst movie of priyadarshan (released alongside the much better cyonki, who was also his director), does not contain any specific story and focuses only on the discovery of the body through the onset of actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan gets too repetitive in his comedy films, just like govinda and David dhavan did in the past, after they offered good entertainers and they lost the audience. That's why it will be good for him to focus more on the scriptures and try some variation in his direction. Give us more heroes and malamals a week, rather than giving duds like mass masala!
