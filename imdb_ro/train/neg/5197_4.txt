Poor entry to the Bulldog Drummond series with John Howard in the role. The usual funny banter and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore does something to do as an inspector, changing the disguises to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a wild hunt (especially in circles, perhaps the budget was stricter than usual) to save the poor Phyllis, will to entice Drummond to his contempt. For those who keep the score, Drummond intends to ask Phyllis to marry him, and Algy is worried about the child's baptism. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed as a fisherman to mingle with The Angler's Rest, but few of them rise above stupidity.
