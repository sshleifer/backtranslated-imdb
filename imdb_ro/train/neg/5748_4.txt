I have to say that I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. Almost half an hour of boring conversation, I'm sorry for all those who really care about the plot, we've just begun to quickly rediscover Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the end, I was so bored with that. If Gerry was not in it, I probably did one of two things: asleep or stopped, but Gerry is the shining light of this film, as is the case with most of his previous films. If you're a fan of Gerry, do not worry, it's so adorable and precious as always, but if you really want to watch the movie for plot, luck because you need it, or a lot of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's because the casting director made sense to put Gerry in this movie even though they had no idea how to write his name!
