I can not believe I'm wasting my time to look at the trash! I did it because Leonard Maltin gave her an "AA" rating, and for TV movies this is usually a trusted indicator of quality entertainment. The actor was OK, but whoever wrote it should forever be denied access to any medium of communication. The plan is ridiculous, the motivations of the totally absent "bad guys" and various silly and superficial family interactions. For example, Dad says that the violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but proves to be an "admirable person" NOT because of his "ignore the idiots" philosophy, but because he is good enough with his fists ... <br /> < The only message I could get from this pope was that the nuclear family is good and the alternative life arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to the good people.
