The end of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is quite weak. There are a few things that derail this movie. First, Tarzan spends much of the movie wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion, any footwear on Tarzan, whether it's sandals or boots, as sometimes portrayed, removes the character that should be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. Secondly, the character in Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, completely derails the film as a comic strip. For me, its character is useless for the plot of the film. Also, while Weissmuller still cuts a commander like Tarzan, it is obvious he was not in the best shape. Although in his subsequent Jungle Jim movies, his physique has improved to some extent in this film. Fighting octopus is a great idea, but I think it should have been done in a Weissmuller movie earlier when it was at its peak. Also, the battle, which lasts only 30 seconds, would be far more thrilling if it were drawn from 90 seconds to 2 minutes, such as the classic crocodile fight in Tarzan and Matthew. Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleased with the eyes, fail to save this latest Weissmuller film - a disappointment ending with an extraordinary character.
