<br /> <br /> The film begins as an ordinary movie-movie-hero. It's the boy who's taken away, he has no parents, and he's crazy girlfriend of # 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there's nothing you can not guess coming into the movie. Toby Mcguire tells us he's not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one. Perhaps kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film, but it is a bit violent for the youngest. You can not get rid of movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. We've almost gone in the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good, however, was computer-aiding, but there is nothing to put in Christmas! So my recommendation: You do not see this movie, even if you're paid for it!
