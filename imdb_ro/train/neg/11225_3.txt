This documentary is a renaissance of Betty Page's latest career (Paige Richards). Tennessee tension was the most recognized queen in history. The most memorable thing came in the 1950s and was the photo of fetishes, slavery and the fight with cats "girle girls". Star Star News's Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) instructed Betty about what to do in front of the room. There was no nudity in the famous photographs or "deer films," but Klaw was entrusted with the distribution of obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them in order to avoid criminal prosecution. It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of his career. The girl next to the black-haired door, the blue eyes, and the hour-glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not, would be fascinated for decades. After all, she was told she was shot more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed picture in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her to the last years of religion. This movie could have been a lot better; but good enough to have an interest. Miss Richards is amazing in her own right. The bra, the panties, the garter belt and the hose do not hurt the image. Also in distribution: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Keep in mind that this movie can change your heart rate.
