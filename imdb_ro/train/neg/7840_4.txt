This film is narrated through the eyes of a young professor at a Catholic school, following the RAWANDAN genocide around him. The film begins with a brief explanation of the historical past and Rawanda rivalry. Then he jumps to the story, as it is in the eyes of a young idealist "NEW-COMER," a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. When he and the driver approach a road jam, they play with ID drivers. not realizing that this is a serious moment, and that if the driver can not be identified as belonging to the tribe of the soldiers, they will be killed. And as he treats the unlearned story of chaos and unfolds around him. Suddenly he realizes that each Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. The media cameras can not stop the machete, and there are too many mercenaries who use the militia - and the men shoot. the title comes from the captain of the army saying he will shoot the dogs that eat the dead bodies around his complex but he will not shoot the soldiers who kill people around the complex. Mainly because they did not fire the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the type that tells the escape team that he wants to give up his place for one of the intentional victims, runs with the tail between his feet rather than confront immanent death with the school children he promised he would not leave behind. It's more of a character study, and it came at the time of Jesus for a character, except a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie was not supposed to take place in RAWANDA, there could have been any of the holes of the hell genocide that is happening around the world at any time.
