What's going on with ITV Drama. First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television drama I've seen over the years, and now "Perfect Parents" end up completely from start to finish. Anyone responsible for putting this current into operation should receive the P45 with special delivery. In most dramas / thrillers, it is necessary to suspend certain levels of faith so that the parcel line can develop, "Perfect parents" have taken this to a new level, we have suspended so much faith until the end of this nonsense that I felt I was forced by a truckload of "magical mushrooms", it was as if the screenwriters decided to try and create a "Drama by numbers" involving some serious issues - Religion, Education, Gloom, Fear, Murder, Paedophily, the only problem was that Great Eric Morecambe said when he played a piano: "In the right order." For your next Script guys, we suggest trying to read more script development books than "Script Writing For Dummies". Because of the ridiculous Script and the total lack of Tension in the Direction, the act was adequately low key, not blame the actors because the distribution was top notch. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this drama play share their tools when they follow the postman to send a scenario from the ITV Department of Theater, make sure the mailbox is tight!
