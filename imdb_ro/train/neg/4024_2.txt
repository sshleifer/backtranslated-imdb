This movie is simply terrible. Perhaps John Savage had to stop at this low level to be in another movie. He plays the role of a rare vampire guy who is helping a lady who looks like a wash and thrown in the streets of the street who is a dancer at a local comic club. She acidly tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires when they go out on the dressing floor. Savage is then appointed by a short lead of this rare vampire variant that looks like a cross between the 80s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets all crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a leg with a spider tattooed on his head, also one of the rare. He cites Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just laughed. This becomes rediscovered. And then the harshest special effects that Corri could get by throwing his organs and pulling them out of his mouth. And you can say that's all to fake. Her son does not know what to do with his mother's new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I like a good vampire movie, believe me I do, but I just hated him. Even the photo moves in and out fades with the camera switching that way and that trying to make the vampires move to move the camera fast to keep up and then the camera transforms all to the bright scene Savage chasing the Corri son around until he was blinking. Avoid this!
