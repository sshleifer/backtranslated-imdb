Yes, I believe. It's hard to say. It's hard to feel excited about a movie that has no emotions. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For decoration, it has some stone pillars, some stone chairs, some stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this film is that it's Hamlet, and Hamlet is a great writing piece of writing. Dubbing was not that bad. The voices remained true in the dull, gloomy, lively, choking atmosphere that the movie gave. I saw this version of Hamlet three times on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000, and three times I was about to turn off the TV, despite being MST 3K. an uplifting production of a drama that deserves much better.
