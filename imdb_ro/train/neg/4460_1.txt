Creepy! Avoid the plague. I would love this in the top 10 worst movies in history. Special Effects, Act, Mood, Sound, etc. seem to be made by everyday students ... wait, I've seen the programs better. It opens like a soft porn show, with a mad crazy woman who makes a shower scene, then goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems persisted throughout the movie. Sometimes I swear I heard the kidnapping of the camera engines. Oops! I would like to see another film about this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and crews need more acting and filming lessons. They voted 1 out of 10.
