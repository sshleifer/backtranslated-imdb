This is a science fiction movie of Formula B, and the director has not made any bones about it. It is a dragon that is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything done is things you've seen many times before. It's a weak script, no real characters. In fact, it's full of characters and stereotypical situations. The director is attacking this by just making him a filming film without any attempt to trick us, which gives this film a slight call, but it's not something that will remind you of a while. It is best seen while cooking, cleaning, working. Kind of mindless fun. It takes place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you sit down with your friends to look at, unless you're just drunk and you do not care. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably correct. I do not think it's as miserable as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts thought it was spectacular. That really removes me because I see no attempt to make this movie memorable.
