For filmmakers who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen Robert Wise's 1963 production with Julie Harris, this remake will look pretty bad. For those of us who are, it's simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad action (what did Neeson think?), Empty computer improvements and another move from Jackson's story, this remake. > <br /> Do a favor and rent the original movie. She still frives without hokey special effects. The action is professional and credible. For book readers, it follows much closer in 1963.
