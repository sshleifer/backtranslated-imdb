Virgin is selected to marry a rich guy. A rich guy urinates. The woman on the boat likes the navigator. Sailor urinates. The Virgin participates in a dinner of gross communion. The man urinates at the table. Boatwoman beats tease for little guys. Man claims to be urinated by children. There is a fundamental theme here. Makavejev tries to say he is released in the world. To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who barely speaks ten lines the entire movie, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's really a sweet scene, but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in someone's mouth if you do not happen to share the director's fetishes.
