This film fails to capture any of the mystery and intrigue the book offers. The main point of the book, the visions, is not even touched, leaving the viewer wondering exactly why everyone is doing such a big deal about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Character development is not good at all. No background training or personal development leaves the audience to take care of what is happening to them, so the sequences of action collapse. The search for manuscripts ends abruptly and without a real explanation, leaving no sense of satisfaction about what the whole search was looking for. This is one of the most serious adaptations of a book I've ever seen. It is horrible and a waste of time. If you have not read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and reread it. It's almost as if the point of making the film was to discredit the book, so it's very stupid and ridiculous this movie. It's also a shame, because it might have been good if it capitalized on her at the height of her success and she would have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors. Do not waste your time, read the book!
