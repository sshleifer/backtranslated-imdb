Melissa is sixteen years old and discovers her sexuality with the boys. But it seems that all the guys all the time spend is killed in Slasher's generic movie. It depends on the local sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying, disgusting daughter with two shoes, Marks (Dana Kimmell, Friday, 13th third), to get to the bottom of these crimes. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mysterious and melodramatic aspects of the film and less on the crimes per se and is thus able to differentiate itself from a large number of Slasher brothers in the 1980s. I do not hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to accentuate clearly, saying that the actress is over 18 years old and so I say I'm not too perverted). On the downside, the film is hampered by a few plot points that are underdeveloped and useless, a barbecue theme that is used a little too often and an end that is an anti-climate. But the good is bigger than the bad one (barely). Give him a rent, but I will not buy it. Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her breasts, bush and my ass. <br /> <br /> Red DVD Extras Code: An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Intruder Director Scott Spiegel; Both the director and the theatrical version of the director; Audio conversation with Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still a gallery; theatrical drama for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Rock Stunt, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
