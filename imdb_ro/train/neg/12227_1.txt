This could be the worst movie ever made and it's worth seeing just for that reason. Streisand is incredibly incredible as a young woman who presents himself as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortured, giving Barbara a better look in the worst film. And not even start plotting. You'll get more chicks in this movie than many comedies because it's so terrible. Streisand's aggressive ego, believing that he could somehow lift this lead to Oscar's height, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like seeing a slow-moving twist in two hours, with the soundtrack of "The Sound of Music" being played back on an old pile. It's so bad. I am amazed that everyone in Streisand enjoyed this film at the level it was intended for.
