I have not actually finished the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But I do it just because I stopped it because I could not follow ... I went over half and got there just promised that something good was right around the corner. This movie is so tedious, so unclear that I was actually insulted. I have not read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other gay adolescents who have suffered through it, but I'm gay and I went through "similar" revelations, day dreams, problems, etc. There may have been two moments in which I felt that this film could go somewhere where I felt it might have meaning to sense or relativity but these hopes were shattered when the next cliché-ridden narrative set . I mean, look at the citations on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear the scary game and no echo fades if you just read the quotes, because they are too painful / ridiculous / stupid to lose. I gave the film three stars and all three stars are heading to cinemas that have done a fantastic job trying to transform Archer's "tired" concepts into something that can be traced. I was thinking it was not the one who decided to include all the long television pictures ... another useless cliche already made in movies like Gummo's Korine ... I think it is extremely fitting that this movie will premiere at Sundance just because Archer had connections to the festival through his volunteer work, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival in which the cliché cliché cliché as it is still accepted as "arthouse." No, it's not the art house, I'm afraid it's just a house. Do not look.
