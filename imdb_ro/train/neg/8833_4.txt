Without the guilt of the actors (they all had great performances), the general story was not very well executed. The film opens with a great zinger: an old madman forces a car of an aboriginal girl on the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know why up to 40 minutes are up. It seems these are the ones who finally discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. While the story rises to that moment, it just does not go anywhere. After two hours, I wondered: was there any point in this or was it just to see the characters struggling with charges of racism and stupidity of how they treated the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. While well-acting, there is not a strong backbone in the film to justify the recommendation.
