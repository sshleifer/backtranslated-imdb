In Bridgeport, high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenager Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she confesses the family killing to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, traumatized Donna feels better, but she's still in psychological treatment and taking pills. On her ballet night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends at the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from the prison and is sitting on the same floor in the hotel, banishing Donna, stabbing his friends and hotel staff who are crossing his way. Snoop forgotten "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The bad story is superficial and bad, with a bad action by Johnathon Schaech as a crazy killer. The predictable scenario is amazing, as it is possible to predict what will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("Death invites to dance")
