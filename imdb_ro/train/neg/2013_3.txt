This movie is about what it looks like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and scenes quite in love! The film is not sure what it wants to be and it is a misery. It is much more expensive than most director Al Adamson's films, but it is not at the same level of budget that viewers expected from SF movies. The actors are pretty bad, and unlike most Adamson movies, there are no big names or B actors. Some of the music is OK, but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
