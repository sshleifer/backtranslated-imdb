Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This occurred at 3:00 am on Sunday afternoon and I could not believe what they showed. I thank God that my son was out or I would have been angry if he had seen the soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies do not care who offends or corrupts them? The kids could have followed the church and that's what they look like ??? !!! The actor was good and I liked suspense, but GEE! There were violent and bad guys, but this is to be expected in a Western film. Randy Travis was very good in his role. If writers, directors and producers were just about to give up on so much about sex scenes. What must happen to make them quit going in that direction? Where can I cry?
