this movie is trying to be extremely smart, and Tarantino type, before trying that, however, you need solid film fundamentals. these include good sound, editing, set design etc ... <br /> <br /> let's talk about the sound of this movie. absolutely atrocious. I have never been more distracted by a sound track, and before talking about a low budget, the film made in Chile etc ... lets you keep in mind that drawing sound nowadays is much more possible than it has ever been. anywhere. and more information about the technique is available before all <br /> <br /> the sound of this movie is very bad. Foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout, the atmosphere is just as terrible. I've heard at least four sound clips during the movie, which are the result of playing poor sounds. the sound inside the machines is terrible, the sound of closing the car doors is terrible. the sound of the lady's song is wrong. foley is either overboard, or just not there as a sound person just got bored and gave up. spaces are wrong. everything about it is wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, for example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the next street scene. we hear the sound when we should not do that. Audio edits precede visual cuts. every trick in the book is used and yet the foundations are not there. In the edition we have scenes that use heavy cuts, we have tinkering around the time line, etc. etc etc, yawn. all these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard <br /> <br /> Overall the mix is ​​shit, the sound is shit. and so the film is silly. how can it be considered a movie with so many fundamental flaws for prizes and great praise? Chile's new film wave? the best production that Chile can offer? I hope I do not think so. My theory is that Chile's more selective talent has avoided this film as a plague, perhaps because of its risque content. Similarly, the movie has probably received so much critical recognition from the so-called "cinema enthusiasts" for the same irrelevant reasons. they probably enjoy her mistakes. of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and the quality of this film is garbage. it's about mouth and not pants and never worth a rating of 6.8. the movie has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, the new wave inspired by porn!
