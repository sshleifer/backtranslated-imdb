This movie made me angry! When I think of Cat in the hat. I'm thinking about the cat in the hat cards. You know, the one a few years ago that the parents read their children. Well, I do, however, that this movie would be very similar to that! But much for my surprise was nothing like books! It is more like a humorous film for young adults. On the one hand the cat talks with a gardening tool (cat), the cat talks to him as if he were a hoa (humor adored by agin). the appointment of his car, however, was a little untastful for a children's film. under the evaluation you will find: mild humor and a double-entenders. I think that this is the humor of adults. I wish I could come back to this movie! wal-mart said it would not be because the movie was opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest you give up before you buy.
