At first sight of the plot plot, I thought it might have been a decent film. Would I ever have been wrong? The beginning of the movie shows that a bunch of strangers have gathered and decided to make a low-budget movie. In the first 10 minutes you do not notice the cheesy effect, the horrible sound and the terrible special effects, but then it gets worse. About 20 minutes later I wondered: "What was the plot again?" I could only ask this question when I did not stop laughing at the guise of this film. The main actor has a set of emotions and sticks to him throughout the movie, even if he had to go through love and hate and everything between them. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me live another extra minute of the movie in the previous movie. Now, we are in the middle of the movie, where it's obviously trying to crash Morpheus out of "The Matrix," though it does a terrible job. The actor talks about the "Star Wars" phrases and the words "cookies" is almost unbearable. Now, at the end of the movie, you do not realize it's the end of the movie, because you actually think the intrigue is developing. The character "Morpheus" dies, the only good thing about the film. He speaks a few words and the credits roll. What is this? No plot, bad action, all in raw form, could not get worse. Please, if you cherish human decency, DO NOT look at this movie!
