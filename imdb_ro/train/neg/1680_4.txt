Even with a distribution that multiplies with valuable names such as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to give any depth to this film. It barely swept the surface of the incidents that occurred that night in July 1981. Kilmer moves, while John Holmes, Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopes in two other main roles; as Holmes's wife and minor girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has roles so small that it is impossible to get any size from them. The film also features Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott, and a Paris Hilton camouflage.
