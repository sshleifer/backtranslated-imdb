Very stupid film, stuffed with stupid seals and Jewish references. It was a serious film, but it could not be taken seriously. A family film plot ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Atrocos subplot, involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too systematic. I noticed that Al Pacinos's attitudes seem to go down. A troublesome troubleshooter, but nothing worse than Horrible Pacinos' accent. Trouble control should remedy this damage to a movie. Okay, my lines are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This film succeeds not only to be boring, but also revolting. Usually a rebellious movie can be tracked for the wrong reasons. This movie is undecidable. I managed to stay with this. Planning, if better written, with better action and eliminating horrible subterrors and even jokes, could have thrilled this thriller from depression. What is left to us is a boring, foolish film that assured us that it was trained in our head that Eli Wurman was a Jew. An embarrassment for all good Jewish people everywhere.
