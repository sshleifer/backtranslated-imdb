Dude, this movie is biting! If you've ever been afraid of seeing a slasher genre revived, made as cheaply as possible and as prudent at the same time (PC-friendly, it does not mean nudity, a classic feature of movie filming) Cut. Each clich√© is reappeared without a clue of self-awareness and action. The actor redefines the word "horror". I should have known better that the direct Dutch translation of the titles would have prevented me.
