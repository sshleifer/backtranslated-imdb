This must be by far the worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I thought it could not be a bad movie since he was in pretty pretty movies and he was quite a fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste time in this movie. I repeated over 80% of it and I do not feel like I missed something.
