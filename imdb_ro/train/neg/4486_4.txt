What the hell was that? I saw The Matrix and I was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers have ever done to make this film is beyond me. There is no plot, you can not contradict it. In fact, this whole movie was a talk, and I do not get it wrong, I have no problem with the talky movies, but still speaking in The Matrix Reloaded it was a useless driving task. Then it would be a long battle sequence, then more useless, then another battle scene that takes too long and builds up to the greatest anti-climax ever. A little male man speaks a misunderstood bull for 20 minutes. Keanu Reeves also has the worst performance yet. I knew he was not a good actor, but that was beyond a joke. If you watch your movies in the order in which they are in them, it seems to have gradually become worse as they walked together. God knows what his performance is like something he has to give! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden thing ever to become an actor. After the splendor of the first film a massive disappointment arose. If you have not already seen the first movie, we suggest you watch it, but do not waste time with this pile of turbans. <br /> <br />
