"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolutely horrible discovery of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is about a woman who is taken and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret job for them. (Only the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The combination of action by Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in the history of cinema. Lamas "acts" is simply a bad confusion of Steven Segal. Watching the Orenthal act in this movie is an agonizing experience. Writing and acting are so poor in this movie, sometimes ridiculous. There are so many "film conventions" of action in the movie is ridiculous: unnecessary explosions of cars, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, evil ponies, etc. The musical score resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill", which promotes Steven Segal's theme of this film. There's a lot of martial arts in the movie and it's pretty good for a low-budget US production. The mindless action and above the peak act never leave it, and I must admit that I was easily distracted. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had the appearance of an action star in the early 90's, but certainly not a star of action, so it's making soaps and not action movies. My recommendation is to omit "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita".
