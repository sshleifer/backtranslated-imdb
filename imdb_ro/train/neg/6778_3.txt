Oh dear, oh dear ... For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as her career in the A-list of Hollywood. After turning solidly into "Girl Can not Help It," the bus "Wayward", "The Burglar" and "Rock Hunter," it seemed to me that Jayne was about to become one of Tinsel's hottest stars Town. However, an obsession of racist advertising and an advent in this clunker has downplayed Mansfield to the brink, namely cheap euro loans until Fox could give up his contract as soon as possible. This movie is really a diabolic loss of everyone's time, except for Suzy Parker, which is the only thing in this film pretty bad for the material. Many people blame the poor Jayne and her performance for the poor recovery of this film at the box office and, while it is a pain in this film, she can only do the best with this material. After all, Cary does not set the screen on fire, is it? After a handful of dramatic and comedy stories Jayne takes 10 steps back in her search for a serious actress, accepting (simply to appear with Grant) portray this idiotic threat. Her character by Alice is a full bimbo cartoon and although she looks pretty good to eat in a boot suit, every aspect of her in the film jangles your nerves. We all know that Jayne could do so much more than this slag, and yet she is heading around her like a prize pudding. Real shame. Avoid this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
