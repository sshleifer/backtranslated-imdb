The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately, it broke out because of a poor / implausible story line, mischief and lack of general content / substance. One of the most obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem a small flaw, but indicates the lack of apparent effort to pay attention to detail. The quality of the act was uniformly below the average. <br /> <br /> The rescue of the film was the twist in the plot at the end of it; and a French song (I do not remember the title). On the whole, it was a bad movie in which Sean Connery was visibly mischievous.
