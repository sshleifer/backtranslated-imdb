A true explosion of the literal film. This British movie is boring. <br /> <br /> What exciting plot! A terrorist places bombs in a train. How could the writers and producers of this stroboscope transform this into such a boring story? Glenn Ford, as an expert called to defuse the bomb, receives awful writing material to work with. Naturally, as he is called, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him. No wonder I never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would be enough to finish his career. The elderly man who loved trains and interfered is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was very insulting to show this man, even at the end.
