I am an actor, producer, director and what I am about to say are facts. This project was the worst film in the history of the film. From producer to director and editing this so-called movie is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster release such nonsense? I get my very serious work and this movie is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think. I saw bad zombie movies, but that's what Coffie cake and everything on the table. THIS FILM SUCKS !!! I do not like to talk badly about other film producers, because I'm myself, but please consider another profession. I have respected the fact that you have finished a movie, but I have to ask you, "I WANT YOUR CRICKING", I mean the makeup of your girls, the frightening Zombies, what you were thinking. For the whole nation, if I could vote for Zero, I would have. MORE FILM IN THE HISTORICAL FILM !!!
