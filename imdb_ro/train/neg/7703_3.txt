A famous master of the show goes into the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills her and escapes while an old woman has a heart attack. The name of the female assassin is Sawa. She's still going to school and working for a vicious killer, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa finds out that he has killed his parents. Even the biggest fans of the anime will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is a gore fest disappointment. "Kite" has style, but it's still garbage. The strange plan about a teenage girl killing people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall on his face. One of the most important moments is a sequence of action where the good / bad hero Sawa falls with a bodyguard in a building, yet the dramatic structure is not nearly as well orchestrated and the strange and grotesque animation of Yasoumi Umetsu the faces of the character is terrible. Not only are the sequences of sexual intercourse simply gruesome. <br /> <br /> Grade: 3/10
