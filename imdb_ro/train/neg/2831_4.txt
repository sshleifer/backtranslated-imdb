I've seen this recently with my wife and found it better than Dog thinks, though it's not too much a cop. The greatest actor in the UK has never seemed too interested in this role, which is a pity that he could have raised him with more conviction in his play. Rex Harrison seems even less confused, perhaps not surprising, because his character is badly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is transient and, again, his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is a woman as beautiful as I've ever seen, but it's very little to do, the movie could have won a lot, focusing more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically plays a comic character that does not match the serious tone of the movie. Music is poor, and Omar Sharif is one of his countless unnecessary camouflages (his career has been based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer must be accused of not doing this more effectively, he was an impressively unpredictable director, and this is one of his weaker films.
