Another case of a decent DVD case that betrays the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rochon does a job and Damn! the distribution is good. I have never seen many muscular men meet together on a regular basis. This movie really meant to make you think Rochon was the killer, but it was not. The biggest problem with the movie was that, after all, I did not care too much about who was the killer, and the real killer did not make sense, since it was out of blue and the producers were thinking "ha, betcha not you see, come, brethren! " Yes, there have been errors of continuity (especially with Rochon's closet always changing), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. I was pretty sure that at first it was just a thin excuse for girls to go without a peak, but it was just a trick. Dialogue has been too thoughtful and painful at times. I just do not have big expectations to go into this and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is greatly underestimated.
