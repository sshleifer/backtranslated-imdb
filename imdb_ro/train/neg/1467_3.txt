No wonder historian Ian Kershaw, the author of Hitler's innovative biography, who was originally a scientific consultant for this TV film, broke up with him. The film is historically just too incorrect. The mistakes begin immediately when Hitler's father Alois dies home, while in fact he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. I could endlessly. Hitler's youth and youth are portrayed too short, making it difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Major early-party figures such as Father Hitler's friend Dietrich Eckart or Alfred Rosenberg's "philosopher" are totally missing. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. Scripture obviously follows Hanfstaengl's own gloss over the vision he gave in his post-war biography. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was crazy about Fuehrer. But the biggest problem with the film is the representation of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly, has no charisma, no charm, and constantly orders everyone around. After watching the movie, he wonders how such a disgusting person has managed to get a survivor. Since we all know what an evil killer was, Hitler, naturally, every writer is tempted to describe Hitler as totally disgusting and non-idealistic. But the facts are that, in particular, it could be quite charming and fun. His comrades did not follow him, because he constantly cried to them, but because he liked this weird man. Beyond all these historical mistakes, the movie is well done, the actors are first class, the fires of location and the production design give a credible impression of the era.
