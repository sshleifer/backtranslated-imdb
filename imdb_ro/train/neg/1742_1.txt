Well, maybe I have a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked for the type of video store for Apharan (Prakash Jha), but being a new version is not yet available. So I had to deal with it. It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen a few). No wonder that BOllywood is the laughter of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala -10. I remember seeing a television show about the jazz premiere they had for her release in Mumbai. All the famous customs and faces have appeared. Because of a strange reason, people expect good things from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulch, Hungama or his other films. The hulk, probably named from Tamil or Telugu, came in like a very loud voice in front of you, which again did not make much sense except a Bollywood blow. This last piece of CXXP absolutely showed that this guy does not have the BRAKES. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director at that? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie now. What begins as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensual hunt. Two fashion photographers who work for a magazine share an apartment (not similar to "No entry where the two guys work for a gossip magazine and share an office?" "Jezuz Christ, now copying his own stories! chef or chef trying to help a dodo looking for multi-tasking (multi-tasking). I do not think they even released him, and how sad to get you dirty! "What audience did they have - the poor illiterate Indian masses (the 700 million in the last issue) or NRI Desis- I have no idea what a good movie is doing and it's probably worth a terrible thing for God, a short review because there is nothing about to write, but the usual quality garbage bag F. Bollywood should change his name in Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
