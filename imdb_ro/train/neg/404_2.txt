Shortly after we saw this movie, I questioned the mental competence of each actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why would she accept such an exaggerated opportunity? I have to give credit if the credit is due. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixed, but failed to cope with the perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this film to anyone, to a man or woman who has any form of self-respect.
