I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer ever since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of curiosity, Burton is an actor I really care about, so when I heard he played O'Brien, I was full. I watched the trailer on DVD first and a few fears began to emerge, especially with regard to the terrible "Tematic song," hearing Eurythmics shouting mechanically "1984!" Again and again to an electronic beating is as bad as it sounds. Acting on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth over the end can be felt, especially in the Room 101 scene. However, this is also the case in which the film is disappointed. The film spends too much time concentrating on the love affair between Winston and Julia, which is frankly not what Orwell writes. He wrote about a rough future, how Ingsoc builds human beliefs and then destroys everyone in his name being made to love Big Brother. The film goes beyond what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons, who is approaching his position in life and the world, and his re-education through O'Brien. The comment on IMDb at the moment says that the movie is missing the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, does not commit to Goldstien brotherhood and confess his crimes. There is no clear indication of the initial cases in which Winston finds the article with Persons without Persons, but it is mentioned almost at the end, if you have not read the book completely confused. A terrible scenario, which excellent action can not save. Michael Radford seems to have completely forgotten the point that Orwell tried to do, and the piece of electronic sound is sincere.
