The only reason I'm commenting is that I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although it is likely that we all did it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they have shown these episodes in a different order than filming it. The most recent episode when our unhappy loving, beloved by Jesus Roberts dies, Dr. Cox shook his head. Perhaps he showed them inappropriately for a strange reason, and forgot that they had slipped on continuity. To Shame, Scrubs. They made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot tries to meet Scott Foley and her hair is wet for two seconds before the water strikes it. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show must intensify it.
