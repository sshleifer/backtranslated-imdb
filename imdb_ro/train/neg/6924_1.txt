If this movie was worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This miserable misery makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I saw this pile of steam, but I remember that I wanted to make serious bodily harm to everyone involved. How can someone give this movie more than a star amazes me to the goodness of all who have seen this curse. I give it a star because there is no lower rating. All copies of this film should burn salt-sown land and be reserved as a landfill for the most toxic waste. No, a copy should be kept under ultra-security and only shown to film makers as an example of how not to do it.
