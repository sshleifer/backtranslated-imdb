Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover on the video library? Not. Was it a "food without thought", as the author probably tried to do it? Not realy. So what was it? It was a very normal film that had great potential and was well-targeted, but was disappointed by a confused story without strong points, from mid to late, with a poor adventure expected from the killer in series, who, although seeming upset at some points, offered the best overall distribution performance. It was a beautiful cinema with good colors, cool hi-tech stuff, beautiful scenes, but it lets you lose where it goes and where it just was. And with a feeling of let's wrap it up in the end. OK to watch if there's nothing else on TV.
