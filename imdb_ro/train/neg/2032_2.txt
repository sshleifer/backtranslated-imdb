I gave these two stars for a wonderful clarity of the DV movie, which gives him the cold and dark sterility of his character. That was generous, I know. This movie does not work on all accounts. I can not recommend this because it is neither poetic nor blunt. Neither dramatically nor suspense. Not controversial, nor ordinary. It's just a piece of garbage that can not be recommended by any fan of horror or exploitation in good faith. Do not look at this, whoever you are. . . Get away from this terrible product. Thank you.
