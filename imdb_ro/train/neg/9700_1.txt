I agree with most other guys. A loss of photons and a precious time. Almost no joke is worth writing paper. The only highlight on my part is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds of the old days with RTL Samstag Nacht. It's hard to describe actors' performances because most do not seem to have a good time during production and just "do things." The room is OK, the plot is laughing, I think you would be ashamed even if you talk about it with a lot of beers. Besides, I was yawning all the time, I wondered how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end. My 9-year-old son was pleased, but then he's so pleased at this age :-) <br /> <br /> However, a 1 point rating here is almost a point too ...
