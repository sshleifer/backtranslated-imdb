When you first came out, you think the road brothers might come up with some new jokes. Though I do not believe. If the first one was not bad enough, it is so bad that it hurts to look. With all the actors they had in this movie, you think they could come up with something less intelligent. Although they had failed, they had to take the same nasty and funny joke from the first and put it somewhere in this movie, thinking that people would laugh at it again. Although the thing is, I did not laugh at her for the first time. They tried to make these films parody, although they failed at all levels. Most of the time there are only randomly introduced jokes that are so disgusting and frightening that it's hard to follow and enjoy them. Then, when they try to make scenes that are movie parodies, they try to do a 20-minute recreation of the scene with a joke, maybe the whole scene. Also, for people who say that not for the older and younger audience, I fall within the age range that should be fun. While people say different people have different ideas about what's funny or not, if you find this funny, you probably are not one of the most mature or intelligent around. It does not need too much skill to write a kind of script, though if you want a smarter and more fun movie, see the movie Spaceballs. It is a parody of the movie, which is actually good and well done and it was not necessary to use disgusting and frightening jokes to be fun either.
