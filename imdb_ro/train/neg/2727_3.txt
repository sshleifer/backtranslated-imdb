This oddity in the new collection DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not need to be included because it's just in the movie for less than 30 minutes. What it does, however, shines when it's on the screen. The closest plot to the plot is just an excuse to present a couple of Day Warner contract players. The JANCIE rule shows the promise and is a shame that it has not become a big star. RUTH ROMAN deals with the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if it was in color. The locations of the Travis Air base with a certain rear projection work well. The best thing about the movie is some wonderful musical interludes. If you enjoyed LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, you will love this.
