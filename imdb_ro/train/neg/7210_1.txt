Once again, Disney manages to make a film for children who completely ignores the background. The only thing common with this drawing and the original Gadget drawings are the name. The most serious errors are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from one character to another, Dr. Claw is more a show-off than a bad villain etc., but I'm more than that. The singers begin at the very first minute of the movie - having the Security Guard Gadget named John Brown, does not help him identify him as the classic Gadget inspector. And right at the beginning, we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - I introduce Brenda, which only serves to make this Disney movie compatible. Add to this that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you will see that this will not be anywhere near the original story. What would help would be a better story to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney has failed in this too. The whole movie is just a gadget that acts silly because of love and polishing after Brenda. To add insults to the wound, Disney introduced the new "Gadgetmobile" - does not look, does not work or does not think the same as the old Gadgetmobil, it's just a "canonical" comic relief figure. Disney obviously admitted that Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film and a comedy, but they pulled out all the intelligent gags running (like the awarding paper that explodes on the boss's face) and replaced them with Gadget being a moron Gadget the mob being a wise ass, and the "Claw" is thrown. Someone should tell Disney that the "children's film" does not involve "total lack of brain use". The gadget should target children aged 10-12 years ... not kids 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie should be, NO, repeat NOT, the true Gadget Inspector. Because I like the old Gadget, I hate that.
