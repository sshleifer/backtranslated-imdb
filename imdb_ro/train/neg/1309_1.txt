This movie was extremely boring. It should be at least 15 minutes. The images of the children and animals that were killed were a little disturbing. Usually I do not write comments, but this was so bad having so many good and excellent reviews. I think that in this case we are a step closer to the honest evaluation of this title. What else can I say? I fell asleep during this movie three times. It took about 4 hours after I woke up from the 8-hour sleeping period. I think that is the point in itself. There is no dialogue between characters, except maybe 2 sentences at the end. When you fall asleep once forget that you do not try to scroll and recover, because you will fall asleep again.
