I'm a big fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are my favorite. Having said that, Zombi 3 is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen. So it is necessary to say that I liked it very much, it is the best bad movie I've seen for a long time. The story has some resemblance to Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Dead", but since the movie was deliberately funny, this is the opposite. It has some of the funniest acts I've ever seen, especially from the main scientist. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. Also, the effects are under and in many cases negligent, and death scenarios are often bad. This, of course, is all the more fun. POSITIVE SPOILER - The worst is the scene when the guy opens the door of the fridge and sees the cut zombie head, which then opens his eyes and, to some extent, moves away from the back (obviously pulled out without bending with a string the string), pressing the boys his neck, killing him. The zombie head have the ability to float in the air now? It defies any law of physics known to man and is one of the most absurd things ever shot. This is just one of the most silly moments in the stupid misery. I can not believe he got a rating so high here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker.
