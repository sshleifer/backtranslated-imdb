I was really surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes that are wandering and killing. The magnitude of character development gave each character a name and an occupation, and that's about him. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes have begun, coming from nowhere, with a techno song. While watching this movie, I asked, "Where is that going?" What happens? The actor was a quality high school theater with rigid wood delivery as if the actors were reading books without understanding their lines. Their problems of providing lines have become even more obvious through the horrible sound design. The ADR sounds as if it had been recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly taking care to hit their marks, showing almost robotic in their movements. So these automated automata are extracted through a series of unnecessary and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transition scenes. They've been here, now they're there. This is happening, now it's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun looking at me. It certainly does not deserve nine dollars.
