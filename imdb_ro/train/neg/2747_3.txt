I knew it would be, but I gave her a rent for laughs and perhaps a mind-blowing fun. Anyone who reads some of my reviews can see that I'm very easy to pray. I really did not think I'd get to feel that negative about her. The plot is about an ancient army of dragons driven by a giant snake that will destroy the world, unless some elected heroes who have inherited responsibility can be considered? has become one with ?? a good dragon? or something?? I do not know. It was so bad I did not bother to make too much effort to keep it. It has a really bad story full of ridiculous moments and gossiping concepts. So many of the events felt totally random and sudden. I suppose there was studio interference or something, because the biggest problem with the movie is that the story seems to be trying to be so grand and epic, but it all happens so fast and it's going so fast. I feel like I've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in a big ball. The film is like a shot in front. It does not take too long to set up characters or dramas. Imagine the Lord of the Rings trilogy in 90 minutes? You could have more epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would hardly care about the outcome of these battles. Was that the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes from me do not give a stupid thing, waiting for it to end. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with a good director, but horrible drive, fast pace and bad story made it very hard to enjoy any reason. I probably would have loved her when I was 6 years old.
