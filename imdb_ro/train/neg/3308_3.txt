When you get your hands on a British movie you expect a kind of quality. And when it comes to acting, room work, lighting, etc; this movie makes the business. It's made by highly qualified craftsmen. Only this can bring you a pleasant day and a half. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you find nothing. In addition to feeling good and supporting a liberal vision of drugs, there is nothing there. The scenario is mediocre, the plot is predictable, and the end has to be one of Hollywood's worst est. In everything that is comfort in English, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea, except to make money of course.
