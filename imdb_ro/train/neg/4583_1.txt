If you want to see an intelligent philosophical discussion about human possibilities and potential, watch "Waking Life," which is brilliant. "What we know" is everywhere in the spotlight, badly directed, badly written, badly acting, completely devoid of any direction of art and completely annoying. It was not thoughtful or fun in the smallest. The inclusion of this odd "Ramtha" in this movie is a good reason to avoid it. Is not it strange how directors choose to look at the fact that this woman worships before a 2,000-year-old Atlantic god or something like that? What kind of flakes is that old chicken, and what total loss of my time and money was this film. People responsible for this film should never be allowed to make another film.
