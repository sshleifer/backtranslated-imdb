This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriel (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), 37, and Marty (Frieda Pittors), the oldest mother of Muriel. I live together in the same building. They have different life expectancies. The vital laura wants a baby. Muriel comes from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing is happening in this movie, so wait for something - for an accident - that could dramatize this story. With time, discover that Dorothee Van Den Berghe just wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences, which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of nakedness.
