A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of him who had been chosen by a movie studio. To say that it was one of the most ineffective and insipid scriptures I'd ever read, would be a bold sub-evaluation. Nevertheless, I never told her that. Why? Because in a world where movies such as "While Out" can be lit in the green and can attract an Oscar star, such as Kim Basinger, a script that is devoid of character, content and common sense does not guarantee that it will not sell. <br /> <br /> As many other commentators have pointed out, "While Outside" is a horrible under-written film "Woman-in-Peril", who abused the housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely traps in Christmas Eve. Any flu is legitimate, from weak dialogue and bad action to logical robberies, but Basinger is such an exciting actress, and the premise is not without promise. Here are some things that hit me: 1) I do not care how much we should think her husband is a bastard, the house is a mess with toys. Since child abuse has taken place to make children stand up for themselves? 2) Various racial bands are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racial groups balanced on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course the movie is stupid. But so are the countless "thrillers" I have placed where women are portrayed as victims of male sadism misfortunes. Stupid or not, I found her refreshing to see a woman who got the best cakes. 4) I loved the end! <br /> <br /> 5) Although an earlier commentator invented this sentence, I really think this movie should be re-titled "The Toolbox Red of Doom".
