never ever to consider this evil excuse for a movie. the way it is shot, lit, acted, etc. Makes no sense. it's so bad that it's hard to look. a lot of clips repeat beyond boredom. does not appear to be a "normal" person in the whole movie, and the existence of the "outside world" is, well, there is not. and why does that guy get suddenly invincible? this movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
