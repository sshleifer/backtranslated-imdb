First of all I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This movie was a total garbage. I could not stand to look at her. The story was a joke, the act was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombie 2 is even more a joke. We're coming from Voodoo to DEATH 1 People BACK TO LIFE. Regardless, this movie is not worth $ 1.00 cost to rent it. I really liked lucio fulctic movies, but it was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 will be, I think I will change them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is a wonderful flique tho.
