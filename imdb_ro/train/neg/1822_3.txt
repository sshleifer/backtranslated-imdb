Greetings again in the dark. What has happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my favorites all the time in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had some beautiful films ("Rainman"), but he always offered something interesting ... so far. I think the worst thing you can say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the boring definition. Never a big fan of the pure bat ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was just amazed at how terrible this movie is. There may be 2 chicks in all - if you can pay attention so long. The best part of the movie is the song of the title song by a Redbone sound-alike. If the movie had been written and the song would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to make comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes only one weakness. SNL member Amy Poehler is accustomed to her top in her role as trailer parking garbage, transformed by princess. The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first shuttle work together promotes a promise, but then their chemistry disappears because of the poor scenario. This scenario is that most of Jack Black's character ideas - it's not a bad thought, but no hope for success.
