I sell it as a horror film, it was supposed to be a thriller, but it seemed funny to me (comedy, does not believe), I laughed the whole movie, I think it was because of the ridiculous adventure and the plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a "good bad" very good. I liked playing in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is a beauty and a good actress, but try to be a small objective here, the story mm mm ... the direction mm mm ... does not have much good suspense, in fact it is a very boring film, but it is a thing good, it's a short film, just 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was just as much as 10 minutes under water) I do not know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even bigger, what is wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
