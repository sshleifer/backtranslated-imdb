This is almost like two movies - one engaging and engaging, the other stupid and clich√©. It is indeed a shame that all the problems have not been solved with writing, but given how quickly most of the B movies have been written and produced, this is not unusual. It's a real shame, though, because this could have been a very good movie. First, good. The movie is original and involves code interruptions in WWII. This is quite fascinating and I liked to see the leader (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a master-breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film were very good. But now for the wicked, the movie went too long and lost steam in about 50 minutes. In addition, Jean Rogers's role as "frightening girlfriend" must be one of the worst-writing and distracting roles in the history of the movie! For every intelligent Bowman move, idiot Rogers went in to snap things up like a kind of "light comedy." If her role had been intelligently written, the general movie would have improved a lot! Instead, watching it is hard to understand how we actually won the Second World War!
