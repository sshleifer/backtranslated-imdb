How can a big German show transmit such a thing? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every talent that works - Even the well-known Gottfried John behaves very poor - especially in the double scene of the crime - as amateurs .......! The screen plan is very, very extensive - probably to complete 2 parts of the film. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, f.g. scenes on the ship with great unreal in the background ...! In the German version, the sound and dubbing are very weak - probably the reason: different languages ​​of the actors - but: other international productions are doing much more professionally. Tip: DO NOT WATCH - it's a diabolical loss of time!
