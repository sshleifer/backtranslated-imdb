The cult of personality raised the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. as the kings of B. Since the people of Crown International were so important, they were not elevated to the status they are richly worth. A movie like THE VAN could now look like a disposable piece of drive-in esoterics, but it was a considerable hit when it was released (not to mention later re-releases as a dual feature with other hits Crown). <br /> <br /> The VAN was a perfect example of Crown's successful strategy of taking advantage of the mood of filming when the film was released. Here was sex, drugs, rock'n roll and short "Personalized Vessels". As others have mentioned, it is ironic that the "hit" piece of the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a Selectman town, where I was at that moment, even saying that these vans were "a sin on wheels". A perfect video ad line! There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscles and hijinks of low leaf (including a little support from Danny DeVito). In many respects, this is not much different from the old movies on the beach in the 1960s, but now enriched with the use of nudity and drug use. Obviously, on a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film stretches along the beach with a glamorous charm that compensates for some, today's standards, with a single women's PC screen. a toaster for Bobby's noise on the wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you gotta have something hot for munch! Grindhouse Fest.
