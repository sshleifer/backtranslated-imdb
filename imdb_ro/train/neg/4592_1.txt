This movie made me very upset. I desperately wanted to let the "scientists" and the unseen movie makers along the way. Very, very painful to stay. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst. Few information about brain function / quantum theory and quantum theory are lost in a great deal of new high qualities. The worst offenders were Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead the life of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, lives on a higher plan. Even the ideas and attitudes with which they are in principle agreed are presented in such a cumbersome, embarrassing, superior, pretentious manner of preaching that I felt the desire to reject them. I think that made me so upset that they took the profound aspects of the established scientific thinking and marked them with their new age. Much of it is based on the error of applying the concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Naturally, the dramatized parts with Marlee Matlin are amateur and clich√©. I would instead refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent science study: "A Short History of Nearly Everyone." There is a profound wonder about life and the universe in real science, established.
