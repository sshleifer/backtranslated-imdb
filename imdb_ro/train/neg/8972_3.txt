<br /> <br /> The main question I'm asking about this movie is how you make a porter's musician's filming and use only 3 of his 15 songs! merman and lahr played the main roles on Broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker balls of skelton and lucille. plot abound changes and fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
