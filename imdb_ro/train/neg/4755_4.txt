I thought the movie was good in parts.the beginning was exciting the first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The camera's nails in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it if the actors did not cover it altogether. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie were not that big, which we expect very much for such films. The dialogs did not make sense, and I did not think I was very full of spell. I felt like trying to copy movies like phones in terms of dialogues, but they did not manage to be miserable at all. It seemed like many of the actors' scenes were for her sake and they did not make any sense in the story. The whole movie has only laws and dog. I do not think it was a waste of time, it's OK, but not gr8
