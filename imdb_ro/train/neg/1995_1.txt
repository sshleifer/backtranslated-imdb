Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie and it's not worth it. It seems to be out of a bad print and it's in the public domain, I guess. Negle - despite its glory, prizes and reputation - is a familiar British pit that can not sing or dance or act. Some of Hollywood's old character actors on the screen must have thought they were making a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always believed that Anna was the most exciting and talented female on the screen. It was wrong. It was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. Her "serious" roles are even more absurd than her musical appearance here. Only a few of the most popular songs are included and none are well presented. Skip it and find out who plays the role of Doris Day. At least you'll get a real dance of comedy and professional style!
