I should have listened. I was warned and yet I paid for this after reading all the reviews after I knew the original was "so bad that it was good" and part 2 did not fall into that category, though , even then he could not resist. Exactly what happened here? Part one was delusional, it had so much political incapacity, and other fun and fat-free fun, and that could not be a worse continuation of God's green earth, not box 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst continuation of history, and that really says something in view of the essential foundation behind the quality of the original. Criminal Insane Part 2 was just a brand completely different from bad. Shot on Video, zero score, zero value entertainment, 1/3 consists of original flashbacks, and over all this, crazy, fat Ethel has lost some of its circumference. I mean, honestly, is this a sick joke? Thanks a lot, Nick Milliard. 1/1
