Probably not, but it is terrible. Even the fantastic song can not save it. OK, I admit it started pretty funny, but it seemed to go down as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray turned from being a humorous, humorous guy in a hole that shouted things to the street people who were simply not funny, as if he had tried too much to be funny. His character stole a weapon (a RV? Come ...) and gets to become a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers for a laugh. One good thing is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecile they are, albeit unintentionally. In fact, I felt disgusted that some kind of propaganda fool could be released.
