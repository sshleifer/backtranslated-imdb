This film, without correction, this, the abysmal abomination of the heaps of hell had to be killed before leaving the writer's head. I could not find enough adjectives to describe this movie. But try anyway. Terrible, bad, nauseous, tasteless, nonsense, induction of vomiting, bad intestines bad, hideous, nasty, nasty, there are not enough words in English! "Crying" involves a serial killer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, it is not important. The murderer's snow man leads to killing people. How can you ask a snowman to kill someone? In tasteless ways that make you want to keep away your eyes only if you do not have to bear the Styrofoam snowman anymore. In ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so that you never have to endure your snow claws. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it at sight! For your soul's sake, do not look at him!
