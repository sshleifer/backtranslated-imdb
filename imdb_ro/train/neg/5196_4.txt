Although a bit technically polished than the previous movie in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escape both in a less thrilling plot and a leading man who simply does not have the Ray Milland charisma. <br /> <br /> That being said, many actors and characters continue to play their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also, John Barrymore is present, appearing throughout the film in a variety of brilliant disguises. However, there is another endless night for BD, while he and his colleagues are trying to try to save the poor girl they intend to do to get married. The indexes are stupid, but again, the actors who support them are often entertained.
