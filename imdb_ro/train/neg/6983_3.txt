Revolution is a terrible movie, I do not care if you are a history teacher, a news writer, a fan of Al Pacino, there is no way that this movie can win a legitimate "10". <br /> <br /> The key shows that Tom Dobb (Al) is trying to get money from a note he received for the radical patriots who took the boat. Everything hovers around that note. Tom's son joins the army to align with the note, making Tom join the army, going into an adventure trying to get out of the army, a few years later, the war is over, and eventually turn into note for their boat. End. He had some battle scenes and, at best, they were quite mediocre. The transitions between the scenes were used "five months later" and magically put the characters in a famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is hard to follow. So save the "Notes" and watch the Patriot instead.
