I work in the "Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack" and "The Witch Mountain" (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th film in the film. The film had nothing to keep an eye on. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The act was weak. Characters were unsatisfactory. The best scene is the beginning with an exasperated woman who is led to burn her apparently beaten daughter. However, the only link that this scene has with the rest of the movie is the main character, Mario, who has the most gigantic mustache ever. But that's it. The film was not effective at all levels. The music was too intrusive. The illumination was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It really can not be traced - what can I say?
