The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A story of Lady and the Tramp in two ways - rich girl / poor boy and ability to bloodline. The sequel, however, is not just a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also on a ridiculous, exaggerated Disneyfied misery, best summarized as "Rambo meets black stallion." No Black Stork charm. The young hero returns from a 3-year absence and, suddenly, is Superman on the road; In the original, good film, he was real and credible but, unfortunately, reduced to a further caricature. I was not as disappointed with a movie and sometimes it made me quite upset - they just missed a clich√©. Handling the Brazen Audience - Are you facing studio heads that everything you have to do with a horse-loving audience is to put enough horses in front of them to make them happy? A disaster of a movie.
