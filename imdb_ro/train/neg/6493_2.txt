Oh dear ... as Englishman and a small part of Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in industry ..... so far, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I am a nobody who hopes for the better. So, my comments are "straw in the wind". But that's the purpose, is not it? - I have no ax to eat the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the great immeasurable, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. To give, suspend the faith for a short period of time. But not to get into total mistrust. Had it been an unknown author and director, I would guess that this "production" would have been criminalized in oblivion. Unfortunately, no, and I was left wide-eyed and confused. After seeing some of the reviews given by this work, I'm a little worried ... Perhaps I try without prejudice to see each film on its own merits. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the notoriety of the content. My advice, like many before me: Do not write and direct the same production. It is full of danger. Movies must be moderate to maintain credibility. As stated in the school reports "It could and can do better ..."
