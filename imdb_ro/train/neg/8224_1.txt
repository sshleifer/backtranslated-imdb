Watching this movie? I thought about myself, what a waste. These girls must have stones for the brain to even agree to be part of it. The loss of time looking at him, the weak sky I hired. The act was under-standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone thinking about watching this movie, you save your money. The film has no credit at all. I am a true film director and this is worse than "The Red Green Attack". I only hope that this piece of garbage did not cost too much to do. Money would have been better spent on homeless people in the world. I only hope there is no continuation of the pipeline.
