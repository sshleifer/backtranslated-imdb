This movie had no huge star but had a very good cast, full of excellent actors and Gene Tierney, before it became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jos√© Calleia, and Cederic Hardwicke, you would expect more from the film than you actually did. Most of this, I guess, is due to a secondary scenario, because director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. The film is in East Africa during the Second World War - even before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause problems among locals. One of the white men in the movie is a double dealer - working to destroy the British Empire! But, the wonderful Tierney, who plays the daughter of a sultan (!), Is about to save the day for the good of Great Britain. American film makers have long divided the Empire and the 1930s and 40s have seen plenty of pro-empire movies. Nowadays, with changed sensibilities, the notion of seeing the happy black natives who die for the Queen and the country seems ridiculous - and it would be hard to root for each side! However, on this day, this piece of propaganda has been effective in supporting the film - although seen today, the film suffers from a long scenario and silly casting. The only bright moment of the movie is the last showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after a scene so strong that the movie seemed to talk and talk - to lose some of the punch.
