I did not like this intense movie and I left during the scene where the loyalist band was pushed by the British. The film actually blames the people of NI as the cause of their own troubles. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's division of Ireland and the domination of its history, meaning NI was created by the UK in 1921, regardless of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. /> The characters are portrayed as mad, even if they despise loyalist paramilitaries fighting for a cause - preserving their artificial privileges on the Catholic community. It is known that British Intelligence has collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt, to keep Catholics naked and to demoralize republicanism. The values ​​of the ninety years of "machismo", masculinity, etc. are transposed in the 1970s Belfast and portrayed as part of the alleged Irish "psychic" that leads to violence. The stupid song from the club woman - old Ireland of green fields .. blah..blah .. - has a symbolic stance, that is, poor, mad young men fighting for an impossible cause. Things, ahistoric, cheap and ugly things. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
