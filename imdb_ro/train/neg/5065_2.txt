This movie is simply bad. Low Story, Poor Direction and Less Than Medium. The thing that really irritated me was blatant advertising - constantly - for a well-known internet provider. It is obvious that some scenarios are written to do just that, advertising. This film is a slap in front of anyone who has paid for it. Do not forget this, it's not worth your time.
