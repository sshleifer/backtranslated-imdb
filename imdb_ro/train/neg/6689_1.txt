I can only assume that the other commentators of this "film" are shareholders in the production company because it was probably the worst film I've seen in the past five years. From the opening blow of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably, for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "level B". Both my wife and I were in good shape before we started this movie and I was really looking forward to a funny popcorn movie. I knew we did not rent Citizen Kane and we did not expect to see the most amazing film ever. However, after 40 minutes to resist the most painful piece of garbage we've ever seen, we shut it down instead of wasting other minutes of our lives. If a "comedy" without laughter, terrible looks, thin plot, and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Frankly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at popcorn sex scene. I can not justify writing a longer review of this image because I've lost almost an hour trying to find a joke.
