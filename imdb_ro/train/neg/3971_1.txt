Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me a little credit. This movie was shed worthy. Unnecessary and time-consuming. What a loss of energy and totally useless. I understand the premise and the idea sounds, but give us a break! Next time give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mother remorse, husband blame! Clich√© da ~! Take a life! Sorry, this movie was a total loss of my time, my money and my being. I prefer to watch eggs! No real explanation of why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obviously, but why? The actor deserves what I do here Oscar and cinema Do it just for a salary? How much did this movie do? Well, this fresh madman hired a copy. Quite telling
