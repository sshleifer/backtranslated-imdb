This movie is bizarre. Better said, it is "odd" weird. I could give you a summary of the plot, or an analysis of the torment, but I think it is a waste of your time. Everybody needs to know about this movie are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, homicide, post-mortem mutilation, and a really disturbing infatuation. At the end of the movie, you feel like going to have a shower to wash the dirt, but not in a good way after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club." It's like being a teenager (or a tall colleague being the fact that I am still a teenager myself) and you just did something you wanted him not to have done and B: he hopes the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never know about it. And nobody likes that. Recommend me that, rather than disturbing your mind and looking at dirty kinematic dirt, you simply waste your time on something a bit horrible and watch "Kazaam" (yes, I would prefer to look at "Kazaam" read in it what you want).
