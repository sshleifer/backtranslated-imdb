I often do not watch a film as horrible as this one. I kept looking every minute in the hope that this would have been a joke only to find it should have been taken seriously. Well, as serious as this kind of request. The act was shameful and the situations were blinded and clung. If a movie was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we think the cinema was then naive. As it happens, this movie was made in 2000, and I have not seen a silent-era movie that has such a charm as this one. Certainly not for the serious film. /> <br /> [Not worth an assessment]
