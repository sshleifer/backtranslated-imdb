This film features a series of sketches, which pass partly between them. I realized he was over the end of the movie, at first he only irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come without any punchlines and we can simply try to mess up this, using absurdity and obscenity. Trying to keep the comedy without funny bits is failing. My staff and maybe the subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts in my head every time I call it "film"): A daring attempt not to turn anything into something great. But it failed. At least the director did something out of nothing. But it's not good. Many movies have not proved to be as fun as planned, but this overcomes them all. It's a real show of the worst shooting scenario. Not. To correct me, it's even worse. A movie with gags so bad that they are not at all funny. It's not really fun to see the lead-actor, writer and director (all three of a kind) losing their way through the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is too bad for that.
