The lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. First of all, however, people would compare this to Rock On! but I was surprised to say that it was worse than Rock On! So the horrible story Ajay Devgan Jokes with Salman Khan and Asin that you have to beat me. Music was ok Khanabadosh was the movie, the rest was bad! The Shah Vip has not yet learned from Singh is the king's critical comedy. Now Asin .. from where comes from the bad for Asin's fan there, but she sucks the great time in this serious bad movie acting she does not look good at any overdose of makeup! My final verdict I'm going to see Aladin with your family, losing your time here.
