I would put this at the top of my list of uncleaned garbage! There are movies that are bad, but the worst are those that are inexcusable, but they are supposed to like it, because it should be good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in his day, could not even awaken a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is nightmare Marxism of the high school high school amphitheater. The film is artistically conscious in the worst sense of the term. The photo has a black and white color. Some scenes are focused or taken from a wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art?
