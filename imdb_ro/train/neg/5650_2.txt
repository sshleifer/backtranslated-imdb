William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving the character as a minor irritation and, in a moderately funny way, it was considered appropriate to widen its role and exaggerate it. Just like in the original Star Trek series. I think I will never understand American humor, which often goes "over the top" to get the message. Vote with my feet. I do not watch the show again, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast was good. It is a shame that Shatner's role also affects James Spader's performance. But most demonstrate how society is running, I think. I do not travel on the same routes. Sincere
