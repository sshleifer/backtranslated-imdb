A group of forest foresters and scientists enter the forest to find fossils. They stumble on a Bigfoot burial ground in the end (they did not notice it in the dark). CGI Bigfoot scenes are horrible, but better than endless scenes of talking that seldom score. I thought it might be a good movie for Bigfoot. But now, after so sad sad movies about the legend, I have serious doubts. To pour salt in the wound to watch this movie, the only beautiful girl just does not get dressed once. And while it may be better than "Boggy Creek 2", it is no longer sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains "Harry and Henriksons." My degree: D
