The extraordinary horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants being equally divided. A condition - he must spend a week in his estate to get the money. And if one of them dies, the others get more. Think about what's going on .... I saw a new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were brilliant and vivid, and the house itself looked beautiful. It's about all the good things I can say about it. Let's just list a few of the issues this movie has: the killer is a shout of obvious; servants are called Igor and Elga - come! part of the sound recording was so bad I could not do the dialogue (no big loss I'm not sure); gore was rare and very badly done; the other crimes were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains a really abominable action - so bad you look at the screen in unbelief. Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only good enough action was believing Faith Domergue (who deserves better than this one) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and fragile here). I have to admit that the closing line in this movie is a jewel! Why it was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there is another 1978 horror movie with this name! Whatever its name, it's a bad movie. To be avoided at all costs.
