I'm not sure which HK movies have watched other commentators, but Enter the Eagles is not far from the top of the HK game. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad to get jobs in HK because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with her leg than her father), but her acting skills are also sub-par. Actually, all English dialogue (90% of the movie - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to lose my mess of poor delivery and redundancy the English submarine. Of course, there are a few decent shots (but nothing I've seen so far) and good cinema, but visual effects with cheese ruin the action. That said he deserves the admission price Watch Shannon and Benny "Jet" Urquidez go to her. Spectacular and almost worth watching the rest of the movie. Finally, you may notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, especially a shot at an outdoor market (think about Matrix) and diving Fitz from a helicopter wearing black fatigues (I think MI : 2). I think someone thought that at least a few things in this movie deserved to get away.
