What is written on the poster is: "At birth he was given 6 years to live ... At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime." Ami is an Israeli born in the US who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love of his 22-year-old donor did not go well, he decided to come to the US to address the doctor who said he would only have 6 years to live. She wanted to show the doctor she was still alive and weighing 39 pounds. Why? Your opinion is as good as mine, I even saw this movie. Obviously, it is courageous to live when all that moves is the left thumb, but why is she so angry about the doctor who diagnosed the disease 34 years ago? His doctor told his mother only that based on medical history, people with his illness would not live long. What is his purpose to appear at the old doctor's door? Why is this old doctor's pursuit in the US a journey of his life? There are so many things that might be interested in Ami's life: how can those animations do with the motion of a single finger? How can everyday life change while it totally depends on others? How did his doctor's prediction live? How do they deal emotionally when other people see him as a strange creature? The film did not tell us anything about it. Instead, the director received a pickup truck and made a trip to let Ami present himself at the door of the old doctor to show him that he was still alive. I thought it was a joke.
