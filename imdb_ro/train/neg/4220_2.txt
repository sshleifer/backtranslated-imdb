A brief review, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid a 90-minute loss at all costs. At the end of the movie I was not wiser about what happened. It's full of cousins ​​(Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it just does not make sense. Whether the story is lost in the edition they are not doing now, but it is ... Put a DVD in place or go to bed and get some rest! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for casinos and a Morris Minor tracking machine) <br /> <br />
