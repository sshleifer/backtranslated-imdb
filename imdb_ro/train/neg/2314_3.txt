Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced by a double android, Secret Service Agent Eric Phillips follows her and discovers a gun dealer's plan to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders . /> <br /> I did not expect too much when I first saw Richard Pepin's sequel, with a bloody budget / action budget "Cyber ​​Tracker". This film was nothing special, not to mention a blatant shot of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as the previous one, with a full action sequence that opens the movie. There are a lot of explosions, gunfire and a large number of corpses, as well as some martial arts that kindly move the movie star Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie seems like a series of action scenes tied together with a minimal plot. On the front that acts, Wilson is a bad actor. She really has a personality transplant.
