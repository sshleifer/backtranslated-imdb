This is a bad B film masked like a mockumentary. The film maker of porn has almost the same time and a dialogue as any other person. This has completely destroyed any "documentary sense" he would have wanted to create. The fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the smallest of its problems. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing to say about the porn business. It is not particularly glorious. While there is simulated sex, the amount of nudity is easy for a movie with a rating R. One day, someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. That's not it.
