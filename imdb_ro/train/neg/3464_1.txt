It seems that many of those who have watched this movie watched it only because they were filmed near the place they live in. How's that for a call approval? If this movie was filmed near the place where I lived, I would not have mentioned it in the magazine. It's horrible! Some reviews say that this movie is a horror film or a tongue in the cheek, there is none. It's sad to see this revised film as a comedy that makes not only a bad attempt at a horror film but also a comedy as well. But I laughed at how incredible the movie was. This movie has 2 good things for him, his mask and his favorite weapon, but it would have been more interesting to watch an hour and a half of a mask and a gun that sat down on a table, watching the garbage. The social comment behind the film is also ridiculous, juvenile and stupid. Do not worry about this movie, you've already lost the time reading this review do not miss out on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's scary that movies like this are doing right. I expect the entire cast to be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad. there is nothing to redeem in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 per rental and feel that I was pulled. Avoid. 1 out of 10
