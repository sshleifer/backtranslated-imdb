I really hate most of the movies in the world. They show what Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and they think we are a lot of sadistic idiots (or at least the look of sadistic idiots reacting to things is somewhat fun). I have been in LA many times, I have a family working in show business and I just want to say that these are the * last * people we should be looking for a reality check. Some disaster films measure at least one intelligent image: the children of men, 12 monkeys, but the message is usually "people will do everything to survive, everything is dark and sad and without purpose, we should be ashamed of ourselves ". /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I like the idea of ​​a story that explores the discarding of the social order system and testing the proclamation of people in the face of horror, and I think some people would act like this movie but sadistic idiots, I seriously doubt that society will dissolve in every man for himself, that's just insulting.
