I recently saw Belle Epoque, believing it might be great because he won an Oscar for the best foreign film. I was a little overwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the movie. Perhaps the conflict that we have had is that since the movie was filmed so far, the plot of a man who falls for beautiful women and finally falls for the good little girl has been done so many times. In addition to the predictability of the script, some scenes in the movie have really felt unrelated to the story (for example, a certain event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was a bit of preaching in his ideas and about the Franco era in which the film and the Church were. The only thing she was watching was the fierce moments, the landscape and the character of Violeta being a strong and independent woman in times when women were not really associated with these characteristics.
