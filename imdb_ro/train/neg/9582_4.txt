This thrown together piece of feces adds together so many playful scenarios, which ultimately is a laughing riot of absolute hilarity. Too bad, because the premise promises (as is often the case in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this writer it is heading to the ground. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving time for a DUI who killed her mistress. We've come to see him doing nightmares just to know he feels true BAD about that. Then his cell neighbor closes. Or he? Lowe has some suspicions, but it's falling fast. His suspicions are so weak that bad boys do not have to worry. So why did they set him to be killed? Ah, that's where the story could be interesting. There he collapses from the rails and, once on the rails, decides he can escape the attention of viewers for the next hour of diminishing. <br /> <br /> ********************************** ************************************************ ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************************************************************************************************ Lowe was caught by the bad guys in a train. I want a tape she has, because that tape will screw the boss, too. So the train comes to 3 cops, trained weapons, ready to save Lowe. Bad guys kill the cops in front of half the passengers and then ... continue to chase Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! killing 3 policemen in public will take you to deep doodo in hell with the band. However, they pass through a mall that shoots the place, as if the audience does not exist as witnesses, and finally Lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the band!
