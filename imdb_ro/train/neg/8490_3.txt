This was a nice attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above the low budget budgets. The use of virtual sets works almost, but at some points it does not work miserably. They have used the little budget that they believe. I just want the story and most of the acting was better. There are lots of parties where you will see what they were target for and it would have been great if they actually hit these brands but not. A confusing and unbelievable story. Also, bad DVD transfer. I do not like much to see a movie in a meeting. I had to shut down. It was too boring. I can shoot slow. But let's make them appealing in a certain way. From a visual point of view, story, acting, etc. It was devoid of all departments, so it never added to an exciting experience. Perhaps the next attempt of the filmmaker will be better.
