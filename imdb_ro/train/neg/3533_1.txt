Allow this movie to serve as a gesture of death for 'big twist' movies in the 1990s. Known in some circles as "Kyser Soze Syndrome," this mild kinematic hand was now dying by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variant in "A Wonderful Beauty." However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the Soze motif in a much more exhausting way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with an extremely doubtful head) plays Jack Green (known to all as "Mr. Green"). He may or may not also be the criminal master Mr. Gold. Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit that can have members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwhelming examples of cinematic excesses that I have had the discontent of surviving in a long time. Understand fractured temporal structure, painful jump reductions, unceasing inner monologues, and painfully demanding animated sequence. This style of "everything and the kitchen sink" makes Quentin Tarantino look sedative. Cinematic smoking and mirrors make me just think Ritchie was just as bored telling this story as I watched her. The film is full of moments of revelation that are supposed to be shocking, but they only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green, I always like Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he struggles over time as a remedial reader in a class of English Literature Literature. Lack of wisdom is only accompanied by the lack of coercion demonstrated by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Enjoying landscapes like a man hungry in a smorgasbord, Liotta spits, weeps and smokes the film in an embarrassing print speed and leopard display. <br /> <br /> There are no redemption qualities for REVOLVER. It's still a famous Ritchie movie step and maybe even surpasses his remarkable remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst film yet.
