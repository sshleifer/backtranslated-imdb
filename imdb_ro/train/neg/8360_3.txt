What would you like about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> It has an impressive underwater photo! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /> <br /> So, 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music is accelerating! Especially when sharks or bad guys are about to move! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's slowed down! Just as if you were transmitting to the public, it is about to be time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> While another bites the dust! As if in a "Spagetti Western" this has a much greater similarity to! <br /> <br /> It is not the fact that the Italians can not produce quality productions! There have been a series of TV films titled "Octopus" numbered 1 to 7 screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-style conflicts! And they were excellent! But unfortunately, you will not find it here !!! I supposed it was made around the 1960s! Unfortunately, 20 years have passed, as is evident from a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was a sharp bite of a quick shark that makes red dust appear repeatedly in blue waters! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everyone, either in battles in the bar-room or in observing the bloody demolition of the sea by the hungry shark, the hero's pair looks through the glasses of concern as if and he was bored in his constant role in the midst of the lack of many evidence of character development or the plot of no one! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a late-delayed concern for the ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if music fails to awaken our realization, we have the sinister sound in the baddies, as if we were to fight that another dark act is about to occur! <br /> <br /> And close to the end, someone thought of a twist! Only when I thought it was entirely predictable! But stay calm, folks, because you can find another twist! If you follow closely! For more or less, warm up your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and make some beers along the way! Will make Watching Shark Night more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to make your way back to reality when it's over!
