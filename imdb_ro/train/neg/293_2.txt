This film is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who end up getting into trouble because of putting red paint in one in one of their shampoo colleagues and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off in Florida for a holiday. On the way, they meet some boys on a local dinner and decide to meet with the others in another location later. The girls end up on a side road near the forest and stop for a while and one of the girls decides to walk around a little while she sees a murder happening in which the local sheriff is involved by himself. She scares and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to look with her and two of them be killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and placed in the local prison cell. The Deputy Sheriff in the meantime kept the girls and despite their insistence that the Sheriff is the killer he ignores them and acts as ignorant and all the others in this film, who simply can not end up much less some detective work stupid to which. The best part was the scene of rape between the killer and one of the girls in which he decides to rape her in her prison cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the naked chest scene admit it was good, but before their lips meet they have other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon staring at her, the same reason only a different character part. It's not a movie worth renting even for a low budget movie, a 80 and ending was the worst that ends I've ever seen in a movie and left my money back!
