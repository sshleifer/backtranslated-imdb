An original picture of the Sci-Fi channel. A bit squirmish, but not very much. Submarine powered by nuclear power U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a deep mission under the frosty thick ice near the North Pole when he is attacked by a giant electric eel loaded. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) thinks he has devised a way to communicate with monsters, but he is not given much chances for vague reasons. Also in the team are: David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been better if the years / monsters were not so drawn.
