It may not have been Blair Witch's biggest fan, but I appreciated this effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown into various IMDb comments. "Unique," "Clever," "A Future Classical Worship," and so on ... you have to ask yourself where people come up with those things to describe such a poor effort. Because, unfortunately, Altered is a weak and weak film that fails to engage in any way and in any respect. Immortality is not funny. Horror and gore are not frightening. And any "thought" aspect of some poor brothers seen in this movie was due to severe illusions because there is definitely nothing profound or intelligent about this misery OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is it useful in any way? Unfortunately no. To begin with, you get very weak action. It's not a stretch that says most B movies nowadays have better action. Parcel? Bored and dirty. Dialogues? Many amateurs practice better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements to Blair Witch, but at least a little before. Instead, our director seems to have worsened over time, completely ignoring previous experiences. If there is a major flaw in Altered, it is the main set. Much of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are closed, but Sánchez has failed to give any personality. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major role and is just as much a character (an antagonist if you want) like the three students, you think the director will realize that the same thing is needed here. But no ... this place has no personality due to negligent direction and no attention to details. There is nothing savage here. The "Blair Witch" heavy fans are better after Daniel Myrick. Although its production is far from being golden, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately in poor stories but still).
