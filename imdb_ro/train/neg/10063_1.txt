Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs in the movie that means physiology. WOW Some Pokemon demented appear and multiply that they can get a confiscation from that. Animation is unnecessary makers are useless its a great marketing scheme show just cuts on songs and will get a good evaluation I think this movie would have been fine if they got a message you must see all Pokemon episodes understand what it's happening and it's not a movie. It's just an animation should be on the video. Ps: I give it a 1 because I only have $ 5 that I could not give half because there are no halves.
