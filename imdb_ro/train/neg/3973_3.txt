The actor was weak, but in a horror movie, I can live with it if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was an unclear and obvious thing to exploit the worship of most people for children. OK good. Move quickly to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of ghosts. OK, cool - this is going to be a supernatural story of horror, with things rotten in part in our world in ... where ever. Then the action begins to shoot like a dog with three heads in a butterfly and bird butterfly. - Is there a bad force that tries to attack them directly? Is there a bad force trying to attack them indirectly? - Do people do terrible things they would not really do? Wait, can not, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psychic echo room where environmental discord can reverberate into murder? Okay, hold on - maybe it's just a little "Delbert" guy who's mentally embarrassed, missing his mother and a kind of spree like K-Tel Norman Bates? Oh yes, extra points off: the only character Black seems to be the nephew of a "Our Gang" portman. The actor plays just as right as he can give the kissing dialogue, but in fact his purpose is "You did everything you did, Boss!" At least they wrote it smart enough for the GTF to get out there. The little girl with a silent and distant girl was totally creepy, just like the little girl in the shower. These were just two of the many delicious tricks in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, such as a roast bite, a chocolate bite and a bite of a Gummi bear. Everyone is wonderful on his own, but mixed? Yuck! This potential. Lost.
