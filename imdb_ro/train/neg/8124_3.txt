The movie that shoots scenes from a scenic cavern tournament. Do not forget anyone in this movie, except for Michael Pataki, who drew extreme pain like JC in "Five Heavy Ways". She is the very annoying sheriff that we applauded when we practiced our patient doctor. Probably the most laugh you'll have with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures from nowhere. Miss Beck could still be wood? Seriously, if you took a 4-foot branch, stuck it in a hot tub, you could not have noticed a difference. Fear and suspense look at the clock that wonders when the loans roll. Watch him as a late night movie, MSTified, but do not get out of your way.
