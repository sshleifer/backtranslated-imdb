National Lampoon was once a funny magazine. Whether you liked the hippie stoner days of the late sixties or the seventy-seventy-year-old days (when the comedy was fortified with a lot of naked babies) depends very much on the date of birth, but everyone agrees that, Early Eighties, Middle Ages killed any spark of anarchical humor that drugs had not had, and bids such as this film and more and more terrible spin-offs shot holes in the shaggy. Besides a beautifully illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend for this depressing singular stinkbug. If you manage to go through the opening segment, Growing Myself, hoping things will get better, hard luck - no. Who thinks that the idea that a woman has been brutally raped with a barrel of butter, the gold comedy deserved to put her head back on a platter of dirty dogs. If there is ever a global shortage of guitar, the negative side of this ragged bag of incongruous ideas and heavy performance can serve a purpose.
