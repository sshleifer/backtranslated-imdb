Producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone dying of fear while watching this movie. They should have provided intense psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoys this stinker. A young couple moves to a house where a woman looks like the woman of the couple. Extremely boring and very predictable. Eventually I did not care for anyone in this movie. Avoid this at any cost.
