I hired "Best Friend," hoping for a movie similar to teen thrillers such as "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "Our best friend" is much more like "The In Crowd," in which there is no emotion, and the act is incredibly false. "Best New Friend" is boring, and the events in the movie are the same. Jump over this movie ... is a waste of time.
