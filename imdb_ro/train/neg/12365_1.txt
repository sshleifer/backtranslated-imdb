I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators believe that today's kids want stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ??? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they have not been created to be Xtreme, I mean come on! Tiny Toons was an extraordinary example of how an old idea can be upgraded without losing its original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that just want to create a cheap idiot show that children will love him because hey! ! kids love super heroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time when we see the new versions of Looney Tunes but this time in superheroic form, this does not sound too bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy series like the Batman series animated, or new league of justice, the result ??? bad kid flash (road runner) or superman (who else ?? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes were not meant to be dramatic, it should have been fun !!!! as I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why anime is taking the world ??? this show tries to be dramatic and action-packed, but this is something that few series and anime can do if you want to see a good improvement of an old Tiny Toons watch, this is an example that is possible to bring it back to life but with a good story and respecting the original origins. too bad the show is already dead, another wise corporate assumption I suppose.
