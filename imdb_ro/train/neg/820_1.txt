What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very amazing script? Are there few pieces left for purpose? And Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very muddled story? And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such an inestimable role? The Domino principle wants to be in the same position as Parallax View or the Manchurian Candidate and loses the mark with a very wide margin. A serious injury by Stanley Kramer.
