How do I start? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. He does not have redeemable qualities. I just stood in the movie and it was a fight. He did not even get a smile on his face. I find it hard to believe anyone distributing this terrible movie. I felt that this film was a disillusioned attempt of humor. The only thing that deserves something about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure that's why I wanted to see this movie first. I will try this as I try to forget the time I just scattered with this piece of nonsense. I will leave you with this warning. I DO NOT PRAY TO MAKE THE FILM, SUCKS.
