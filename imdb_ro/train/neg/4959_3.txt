Remember the good animated batman show in the 90s? The one people praised? Which people of all ages might appreciate it? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in a bat costume? Who had the wrongdoers you could refer to? The one who had wrongdoers with real motives? Of course, Warner Bros. not. Therefore, this derbedeu. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they ever seen a batman comic? Does he know that Batman wanted to be a "detective"? Bring together 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a smart monkey! This is the basic layout for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. "Opening credits". Batman finds a dead giver where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds an obvious / stupid exit. The penguin escapes. The penguin makes something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way everyone, and I mean anyone who knows kung-fu for some reason). Batman punch penguin. he is beaten. goes to arkham. (Note: Usually, he's a different villain in each episode) As you've probably noticed from this, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of candy on the ground, maybe it's at the old amusement park"! Yeah, maybe he was there six times. And I already mentioned this, but Who knows Kung-FU! EVEN PENGUIN! where do they think? (probably because it's from the people who made the series animated by Jackie Chan). What really is upsetting is that the show is just an action. No smarts. No one. If Batman needs to think, he will use the technology, then make some kung-fu. But hey, let's not forget the villains. Finally, what would be a batman without his gallery? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, I have to say, kudos for originality. I do not think that another type of press would have imagined a joker and a scary monkey man, an executioner like an emo and a poisonous poison ivy as a minor (which is a little confusing when you think about it), her sexuality is not meant to be her main power?) What's even shit, though, is that every character is now a 2-dimensional stereotype flag. <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason. Om-Bat is a crazy scientist of hungry power, who is obsessed with bats for an inexplicable reason. Penguin just wants to steal All. For no reason. <br /> <br /> observing a model here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting must be Mr Freeze. Do you remember the Emmy prize winning the "Heart of Ice" episode from Batman: Animated Series? Who gave Mr Freeze reasons for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in comics on the original story back (crazy scientist)? The one who made him the victim with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin admitted that by using Mr. Domain in that P.O.S. the movie. Well, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr Freeze a jeweler thief before the accident, with only wealth in his mind, then freezes and gives him the power to do cold things. Then he continues to steal the jewelry for no reason, while saying sh shirts! T like "Have a Day of Ice". Maybe they watched Batman & Robin after all. Hey, look at the good side. This series makes you feel nothing for the villains, which means you are a good person. Good for you.
