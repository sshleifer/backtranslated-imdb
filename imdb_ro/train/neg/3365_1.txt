This fresh remake of the classic 1963 classic starts reasonably, then replaces the suspense with unnecessary and unnecessary special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most frozen moments occurs when Nell and Theo lie in double beds, listening with terror from the noise outside their room. Nell tells Theo to give up his hand because it hurts. Nell then looks at Theo, which is a few meters away, and realizes that it was not Theo holding his hand. In the latest version, Nell is alone in bed, when suddenly sinks and slips on the floor. Only when he tells the invisible force not to shoot, we realize what happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's final words will say - "Is it family, has it always been about the family"? The only redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even that can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones proves once again that under her outer beauty there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom has subtly suggested his persuasion towards lesbians. Zeta-Jones, however, has to say, for example, asking Nell to have a friend or a girlfriend. Surely one that should be sent to the remodeling cemetery.
