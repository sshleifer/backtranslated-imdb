First of all, the movie was not true at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie was not like that. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and that's why the film should not have been about a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. There are also a lot of scenes that were simply wrong - the scene where the bike went on campus happened in the early university years, not after him. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not match this part because he did not show the intelligent / individualist guy, so he could not play. It would have been great if he had focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on dramatic lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too shallow to be awesome. Personally, I think he was not crazy or paranoid, and he was on something, because people of that caliber tend to know more than we "younger mortals." 5/10
