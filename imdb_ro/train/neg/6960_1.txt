After seeing the 20 years since Blanche (sorry that I could not take more of it), I have now confirmed that. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "film" is an insult to French actors participating in this piece of junk. Start from a concept used successfully in French comedies ( "Deux heures avant Moines quart them Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs" ...): a historical epic tone / dialogues anachronice. This can result in a shiny bright if supported by the actors and a "fine" steering, avoiding the stigma thematic "heavy comedy". Unfortunately, Lou Doillon face color horse ruin everything and Blanche instead comedy turns into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be puzzled and shocked by looking at good actors such as Decaune, Zem or Rochefort who are fighting in the middle of this kitchy-prissy bourgeois farce.
