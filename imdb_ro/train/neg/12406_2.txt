DVD Treasure Island DVD should be watched in any movie production course! It's an example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the film and listening to the writer / director's commentary graphically demonstrates the great gap between what he knows about the characters and what he tells his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think films are a means of communication and communication is not complete if the audience does not know what the hell the director is talking about. The stated goal of the director is to make an empty film of "Hollywood conventions". Among these conventions, unfortunately, is the coherence of character and the clarity of the concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand the points where he deliberately avoided a "Hollywood clich√©". However, he does not seem to ever understand the idea that there are cliches for a reason. They are the shorthand to transmit complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they have to be replaced with another way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing, rich potential. Two dolls are designed to create a personality and background for an unidentified corpse to be used in a misinformation mission in the last days of the Second World War. Soon everyone begins to fill their personal fantasies with their character and their invention becomes more and more real to them. Someone with less contempt for the "Hollywood convention" of the traditional story could create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie certainly does not! Dolls do everything they can to bring these characters to consistency, but they are often defeated by the stunning and confusing scenario. In particular, they become more impressed by Gonzo, who interprets the lively body. In a series of muppet movies, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
