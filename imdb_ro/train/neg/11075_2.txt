Once, there was a science fiction author, called H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classical book called "Little Fuzzy" about a man who discovered a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to skin their grave before his body cools down. This is the book they got the idea for Ewoks from. Skullduggery is such an obvious ripoff of "Little Fuzzy" I wonder why I'm the only one who ever noticed? <br /> <But do not take my word for it. Here's a link to the Guntenberg Project where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
