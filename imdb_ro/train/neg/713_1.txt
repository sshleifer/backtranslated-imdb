Please first say that I felt so much about this movie that I enrolled in IMDb, especially to review it. And my review? This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting - the Nazis, the occult voyagers, in time, etc., but the plot of the films failed to bring all these elements together. Remember the episode in South Park, which presented manatees writing Family Guy using "balls of ideas"? And these rulers also wrote iniquities? Like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them and then make things less sensitive, included a Donnie Darko-esquire temporal travel theme to the end, disordering the chronology . We could say from the beginning of the year that it was a bad movie. The special effects were a budget cut for something better than DVD. The act was not great, but in fairness I saw it worse. I'll boast of the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the butler's Nazi malefic guy was just comic. I do not have vendetta against this movie or anything else, but to be honest, I'm not even in horror. But this movie can not be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story were well said, it would have been a good movie. But it's over. Waaaaay went over hyped.
