My first question after seeing this movie was: "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from a boy's perspective, it was not done well. Of course, there was formal use of room angles in boy scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside the field of view. The fact that a main character can not speak (obviously suggesting a mutant, helpless position of a child) makes it difficult to give this character to many depths. The melodrama is defined as "a dramatic work or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict." LIAM fits this definition with a T. The spectator is struck by the typical stereotypes of the church catholic fire and brimstone from the stern school marble, and the well-nourished priest gathering money from parishioners. (A stereotype that becomes very tiring.) Moreover - the Jewish characters are money-creditors and factory owners! Much of the movie was predictable ... Who did not think I saw Theresa wash the toilet after her mother told her "No daughter of mine will clean the toilet of another woman!" I'm a fan of British realism if it's okay. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
