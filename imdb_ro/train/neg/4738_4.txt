I liked to look at Azumi's original mix with live action manga mix, convincing story, cool soundtrack, directed (Kitamura rocks!), Editing, not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled it up perfectly piece. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after seeing it finally I felt like I won the lot and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 takes over where Azumi left, but these are completely 2 different films, much slower, the action is not as exciting and choreographic and does not have a lot of character development, which was obviously directed by the same type that is responsible for further reducing the value of the monster franchise TOHO (if possible!) I agree with other reviewers in the past who say this was a missed opportunity. If Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this tranche, there is still a beautiful Japanese forest landscape to look while slow action is taking place and we are too short (even from an episode of monkey!) in the bamboo forest was a memorable battleground. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climate battle scene with a Sequel to shoot the barrel, Azumi 2 brought Azumi cam cam! Azumi's kidnapping at the end was not convincing, but Aya still has a good job. Looks great in his head, but where did he get from? I do not think I will always pursue it again! ...what a shame.
