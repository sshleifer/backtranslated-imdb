Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and linked to Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I want everything to say, but, of course, IMDb stipulates a number of words and all that. I have two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse movie. A low budget like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget scorn like Gigli, Superbabies or this stick. See movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, speedy idiot who simply does not care about his audience. It's more shocking when you think that Uwe Boll (the brain behind this shocking nonsense and already has some real garbage under the belt) created something that happens just once in a blue moon. The horror movie is really bad. Everything about this is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad scenario, crazy cuts of rooms and frightening soundtrack. Alone In The Dark is a dreadful film that absolutely no one has to watch. Woo hoo! Review your. Give me a bud, running on 2006, and I can never talk about it again. Do not watch this movie.
