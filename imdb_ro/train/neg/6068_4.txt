Vodka Lemon is a charming, but extremely uneven Arminian movie that will delight others and carry others. Although it's pretty well done, the movie has no true "zing", relying instead on many scenes that will look normal for the artistic spectator. The film contains some moments of cinematic brilliance, unfortunately they deserve a movie worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light up to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many disoriented opinions and, ultimately, dissatisfied. You can laugh, but these moments will be few and far between a great deal of snowy landscapes and a series of seemingly endless walks. A noble effort, ultimately realized by the lack of narrative cohesion.
