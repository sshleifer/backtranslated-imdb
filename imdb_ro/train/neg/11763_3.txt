Yes. I'll admit it. I believed all the hippies around this work, about the attempts and trials of 6 people living in Mexico City regarding their sexual lives. So I really waited to see a Mexican movie (elderly) that was so popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the movie was completely disappointing. The story shows us two couples, both of them with very obvious marital problems. When a third person enters the life of each couple, their problems reach a central point. Or absolutely absurd. Crying then turns into a sex battle. The position taken by each group (yes, they are literally grouped, girls with boys and boys with boys) is clearly stupid and childish (I think humor should be there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performance varies from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr. Bichir), and Serrano makes an acceptable job in his first work. However, the compelling circumstances of the plot, one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not bad) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc. make the film fail. Miserable. SPyL had a good (impressive) reception at the box office. Believe hype at your own risk.
