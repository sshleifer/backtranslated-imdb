I think I've seen all the movies at Grisham now and generally they're all very poor except The Rainmaker, but that's so bad, it's unbelievable. It's one of those movies in which the character makes the stupid stupid things that no one would ever do. He is a lawyer for the name of Christ. Why when his children are missing, he does not call the Police. Oh, yes, because all cops hate lawyers, so they just ignore it and let them be attacked. When he was arrested for the crime, he left him free, he was locked in a cell waiting for the bail to be heard. <br /> <br /> Why would you take your children halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home. The police do not worry about trying to find a mental patient who escapes, they do not mind interviewing her daughter. As for the ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> In summary, silly, very unrealistic and a complete loss of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
