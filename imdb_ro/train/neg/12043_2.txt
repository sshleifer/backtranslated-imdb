I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brain and spirit, not to mention the face, the pectoral and the rest. Since I've seen it in "Thelma and Louise," a thought bothers me, who reminds me? Troia did it to me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. Differences are obvious, of course. Male, American, etc., but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind, however. He is so beautiful that he is most effective when playing against him. "California" "12 Monkeys" "The Battle Club" "Overturned" His humorous self-deprecation makes him a man almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will be forgotten soon. Only Pitt's semi-naked photos in the sprint positions will decorate the legionary walls of the saliva fans. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great movies of the second half of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing in this direction? I suppose it would be very difficult to say not to the chance to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
