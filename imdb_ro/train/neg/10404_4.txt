This, the direct death from death in the Tremors series, has sixty-second inspired (you will see when you see it) and more stuff and stuff than you can shake them. Tremors 4 was obviously shot in a critical budget. That means they had plenty of special effects of mojo for three or four minutes of worthy violence on the worms, on the tips. The bell, the scratch-scratching scribes and the back writings ensure that the remaining one-and-a-half hours of Tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years. Only Tremors hardcore fans will be able to relax, not to enjoy this movie. If you are not among them - do not disturb yourself.
