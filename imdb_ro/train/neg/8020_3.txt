had some wonderful poetic bits, but it is really an artistic thrust - farce - without any direction or resolution. how do these people come through the film school? who gives the money to do that? could have been a lot more, a leading actor and I always like Fairuza Balk, but let's see, the alt-rock metaphor to look only vacant unable to find anything convincing is just so tired and sure it's not done good movies. the director has to go out and live a good life for a long time and not go back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is the school of art spaghetti-to-wall, just to juxtapose a bunch of serious imaginations and hope hope hope that hell like the poetry to appear. which can work if the director actually has a vision or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here is just a space filling without any consequences. I felt the lazy ending a few moments before being hit and yelled "your lazy bastard" on the screen when the credits appeared.
