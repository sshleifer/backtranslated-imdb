I can not believe how dreadfully this movie turned out to be. I feel great, even referring to it as a "movie". The act was flat, editing was terrible, and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered. The premise was OK, if unofficially: a small group of aliens live in the US and try to slowly take over mankind. But he goes quickly downstairs. How could they convince a "man" to accept a stranger as his wife to make him the foreign-human hybrid I'm asking for? They show a larval stranger, but he never shows what he is doing. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce a perfect skin on an industrial scale. They throw the foreign monster with teeth. The end was almost too painful to watch. I suppose I'm more disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner is dealing with that. How could he tell the great alien alien teeth: "Come out of him, son of a boy," with a straight face? It's a long fall from Babylon for 5 days. Avoid this at any cost.
