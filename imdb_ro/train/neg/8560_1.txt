When do we live when someone like Joe Swan - whatever hell is - is he considered a good director ... or even a director? Where are the new crops of filmmakers with brains and talent ??? We need them bad, and hell with mumblecore! This movie is about nothing, just like the characters in the movie are for nothing. It is this horrible, the so-called Gen Y, which is full of bored idiots, some of whom are film actors without worrying about learning about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a director. John Huston was a director. Fellini was a director. Dreyer was a director, etc. Current movies, such as these, show how long-lived are young people, so-called "filming," when they think they go without script, without direction, without thinking, without a "DV" card, no craft, nothing , it does not mean "rebel" or "advanced." No, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema (and in fact there's a shot in front of you, "be prepared"). > Look at the early movies of any indie filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... none has done anything so tedious and purposeless, but Swan, no matter what the hell, goes on to SXSW every year and greets a kind of grateful and new talent. -a certain director (all seen by me) is just as bad (things no more I made it clearly to appeal to a wider audience, one of the sitcoms). If you are not a friend or a member of the family of those involved ... In the second thought, if you are a family member or a friend, you will probably be ashamed to meet a family member or a friend in such compromising situations. . <br /> <br /> More garbage. This is not art. This is the last opposite of it.
