This simple comedy really does a good job of losing comedy talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misguided here. You may have chucked once or twice during this movie, but generally it is a boring film with a little foolishness thrown in a great deal. The premise, though routine, has not yet been bad, but once the script has been set, the film has not gone anywhere. Do not waste time with this rash.
