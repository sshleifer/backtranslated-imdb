I have always said that some songs of their very nature can not be translated into the film, and this is a prime example. As a play, this is a very funeral parable of the Catholic church, with a raving intelligent and a central character that is so shockingly unreal, we must root it even when it begins to kill its parishioners (of which one made the fatal mistake of admitting that he has not sinned since the last confession, she sends him directly into the sky). This is just an example of how far the game goes, and in the credible world of the theater, it works. However, this kind of increased reality rarely works on the film, and certainly not here. Director Marshall Brickman has gathered a fine cast that does a great job, but presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion comedy becomes a tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the stomach pit. Looking for a production of the stage, instead, you will not be disappointed.
