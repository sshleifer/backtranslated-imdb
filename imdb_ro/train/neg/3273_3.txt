Are the dukes of Hazzard quite an achievement? a $ 53 million movie, which is worse than an episode of a 25-year-old TV show. The land is useful enough, but the mindless fun is rarely encountered, and casting is quite atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more a passenger than a protagonist, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a gentle bully, Michael Weston's Enos, tiring, a seemingly idealistic Willie Nelson, seems to wait for the check to be clear and Burt Reynolds locked in a purgatory where he is destined to relive his old films a small player, it's a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say at least, but he has a good time with a heckler and a hundred dollars bill. Do you know a movie has problems when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen? But worse than scenario or pouring is hopeless direction of Jay Chandrasekhar: apparently born without a conception of the comic calendar, unable to do much more than two basic and seemingly clueless shots about how to shoot a pursuing car, stunts from the film, seems determined to separate the film from any signs of life before it materializes. There are some modern post-modern moments that rotate around the stereotypical role of Confederate Flag and Daisy in each episode, but no film that will make you grow in the days when Hal Needham is driving such things (and stupid) can be a good thing.
