Up to Earth refers to Lance Barton, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and gets to get another body. Lance receives the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So, Lance does a few things in Charles's body. The movie has some laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the animated comedy of 2005, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock did a lot better than that. It will make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really funny. You will laugh at yourself and you may be chuckling, but you will certainly not run on the floor laughing.
