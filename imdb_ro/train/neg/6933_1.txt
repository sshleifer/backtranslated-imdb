Compared to other Columbo movies, it can only be rated 1 (awful). I do not really understand what other commentators saw in this terrible train accident of a movie. It was only through the morbid fascination that I continued to follow it - to see what bizarre or ineffective decision the director had done. Another commentator suggested that it was Falk's only directorial output because he intervened in his role. Actually, I think the real reason belongs to the studio bosses, who must have been horrified when they saw what they had done with their money. It's a miracle they did not kill him.
