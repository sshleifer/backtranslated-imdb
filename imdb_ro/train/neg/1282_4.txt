Here is one of those films ruined by the insistence of the studio on a happy ending. Conflicts that have lasted for many years are resolved in minutes. It would have been more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. Talented Barbara Stanwyck is denied by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and assertive woman to a woman consistent with the one she's been giving her all her life. Brent, as usual, is well overhead, and then there is Gig Young's ridiculous situation playing a character called Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who's coming, but Gig Young, the actor! It's worth seeing a lot under what it could have been.
