Doris Day never leaves a bad scenario to take her down. Even in the most difficult circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually goes unharmed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a New York City defeat in real life in 1965, but truly adapted from a french French piece cracked by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do with fooling his own image good, and the second half be sedated comically (which is fun because of the spin day giving the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the material season was obviously transferred from the play ... and instead of creating some funny incidents in Big Apple, we're stuck in the suburbs. Doris's co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not right for her, nor the shapeless hairstyle she's wearing. Still, it's not terrible, has a lot of laughs, and Day-buffs is a must-see. ** from ****
