The spirit of a high school murder geek animates a scarecrow who then takes revenge on everyone. This movie really annoyed me. It has a wonderful monster, has some good budget effects, a certain atmosphere, but manages to shorten good things to bad. Half way up I started to move forward and then go through the chapters on the DVD. The problems with this movie are many. First of all, throwing looks like thirty, and yet it's supposed to be in high school. You do not believe anything from getting go as a result. Scarecrow, while looking great, is not much over that. He says he's a stupid lol and moves in a way more conceived to be fun, then scary. Is it a comedy or horror movie? It is a problem that goes beyond a single line for much of the dialogue and set up. It seems to send more of each clich√© than an unimaginable horror movie. I somehow expect the movie to be made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to scoff at the genre rather than embrace it. Despite the monster that looks good, this is a film to avoid. Even if you take him to the rental basket under five dollars, you pay too much. Avoid.
