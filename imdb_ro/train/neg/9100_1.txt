Christ, oh Christ ... Look at the astonishment, unhappiness, and possibly disturbed, because this hard exercise in motionless movements is carried out with the spirit and dexterity of a Galapagos turtle. Can there be such things? Is this movie, or have I been an innocent guinea pig of an international shadow drug company, savoring my coffee without being aware that she was stung by a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies and lots of bad movies, but nothing has got me prepared for it; until the end of it, I was a gibbering, terrible wreck, tearing my toothpaste like a dog, flying over the walls, screaming until my lungs were injured. I pleaded with despair, terrible for mercy (for which this call was made, I do not know) and I desired a burning desire for the soothing balsam of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet crying Jesus, memories ... sometimes come back to me. When I'm at the most vulnerable of me, when I'm the least able to handle it. I woke up, I broke into tears, I muiesc nails until my hands are slathered with blood, but I can not destroy them wonderful flashbacks of my mind. I'm haunted. I'm hurt. I'm a man's shell. The other commentary of the user suggests that I am not the only one who has suffered this terrifying experience, which may mean only one of two things: a) the film actually exists or b) they are only a victim among the legions of an international conspiracy in proportion to really sinister. What is quite enthusiastic is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal or at least have not been traumatized by it. Maybe they're part of the surgery. God cursed them, maniacs! God, damn everyone in Hell !!!!!!
