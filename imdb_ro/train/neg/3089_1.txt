This movie is so bad, it's comic. In fact, The Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this movie to beat the game. We suggest that you watch it (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. Please do not see Hobgoblins if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. Actually, you do not see this movie, period. Please. Not at least seriously. Its banknotes are not funny (say at least) and you will have a much more fun parody or you will look at a parody of it, then you will see the movie. You may feel bad when you watch, so you get rid of yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Anything more fun than looking at Hobgoblins.
