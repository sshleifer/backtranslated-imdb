I thought it was a really terrible movie - I found myself actually screaming at my TV several times. One or both homosexual leaders were miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry between them, and Richard Ruccolo showed that he would rather kiss a dog. The film covers their long and tortured courtesy, emphasizing every decomposition and makeup, but without developing the reasons between them in every detail. These reasons would create some interesting characters, not the fight or the makeup scene in the bed (blades even if you liked the movie). Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but do not make the movie rent. Save your money.
