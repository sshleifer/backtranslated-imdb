I noticed that "Fire" was cabled last night, and I began to watch it because I could not remember anything but reminding myself that it was a terrible movie when I saw it back in the '85s. Twenty years later, the film is still terrible. Besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as seen in the title song. Hearing that song again, I made myself want to move a screwdriver in my ears to put an end to the sonic mess caused to them. And to compose this musical assault Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and it was a scene in which he played a solo that continued and continued as though it were Charlie Parker, only his strident tone and play more remembered by a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters have been extremely difficult to accomplish, although I have to say that they have done an excellent job of playing actors just as unattainable as to describe them. Actually, I thought Great Winningham was appealing and initially I felt sorry for her character because she was wearing funny underwear, but then at the end of the movie she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character, who would probably be voted the most likely transfers a variety of sexual ailments if such a thing has been voted on.
