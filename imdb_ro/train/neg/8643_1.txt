A war movie with Blair Witch-War, which is just as much a twist as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and time and spend it in a good movie, such as "Once in Time in America", "Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch a GREAT "war movie," etc. This film, if it was a baseball team and major leagues, was the tip and Single A was the beginner, then this film was a high school high school. It was shot as if it were a club a high school theater filmed with his father's old room.Of course they entered a hostile area (to make a movie), but do not call him so courageous, here we call him stupid! Now go look at her and then you tell me what you think.
