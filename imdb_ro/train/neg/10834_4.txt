Am I sorry I miss something? I left earlier? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) Stories made me think "This will be a classic" But it was all over the hill there! The actress was brilliant because she deserves to be William H Macy is fantastic and gets better and better for every movie I'm watching. But he never seems to connect. I was waiting for the great moment where all the inter interconnected stories and then suddenly .. the frog rains? if the writer said, "I went to the depths as I can all pull these stories together ... Oh, I'll give it the rain." I like smart movies, I like strange movies, but this was weird and boring. 4/10
