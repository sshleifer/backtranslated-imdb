Seeing this was like having a big mackerel that overwhelmed you again. Even when you thought: "The crane can not come back again", there it was. I'm not sure what I'm thinking. This is the kind of pilot I looked at and I asked myself: "Did the actors know I was on a convicted ship, intended to never make a series?" Not just the black stereotypes, but also the Swedish and Indian ones. And while the "Hot Sheds" made these stereotypes in a combination of comedy and inconvenience, these stereotypes were just offensive. There was no line of land, the end was sank on, and the jokes are not. However, if you are a comedian student, follow this pilot to see what you should not do.
