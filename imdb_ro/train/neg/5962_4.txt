Paul Naschy made a great number of horror movies. In terms of quality, they tend to expand from good enough waste to unwanted; and, unfortunately, the rise of the grave in the grave is closer to the latter. The parcel is just your average witchcraft, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock who is killed - but not before we swear vengeance on those who did it ... etc. etc Then we get a session and a lead to another, and soon enough the warlock executed is no longer good. The plot is slow, painfully boring, and the film feels constantly useless. The characters gather together the diatrib and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should stay in acting because the dialogue is tricked in the extreme and serves only to make the film more boring than it is already. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in the blue eyes of brave dolls and the curse of the devil, offers a bold direction here, who likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes movies like this have some charm about them; but Horror Rising in the Tomb does not even have that. This is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest.
