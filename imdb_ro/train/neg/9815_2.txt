This movie begins to present an idea somewhat original, but it has become a great frustration later. What is the business of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clich√©ed plot? The movie itself is incredible. I'd like to know exactly how someone goes to a clinic, gets a nursing suit, kills a doctor, takes a patient to her bed, puts Chevy's pickup and leaves? I think nobody has been able to answer this question, so they dug the other scene hiding these little details. Performances are very bad. The villain is just another "crazy annoying antagonist", no depth, a completely linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are unbelievable, they seemed to have been put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were unnecessary. A doctor sees a woman clearly under strong medication, is refused to examine her, she is pulled out of the house and simply leaves silence? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could do it more than reality. I give it 2 out of 10 for the first time say 10 minutes of film.
