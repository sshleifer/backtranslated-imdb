Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most terrible, amateurish I've ever seen - falling there with Manos, hands of fate in terms of lean action, unnecessary direction, and production values ​​at kindergarten level. In this movie, an animated noise / stop-motion dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins to eat on local meadows. At the thrilling peak, the creature, described by a locality as "a giant helicopter with heels," pulls the weight over the ground to drive away the lunch before a bulldozer strikes a few times and dies of boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. An unnecessary subplot shows that a boy goes to a beverage store to buy a 4.75-dollar Ripple; Instead of simply buying glass, the idiot shoots the cashier and another participant, shoots a policeman, watches over the lake, so he can eat the monster. The nearby shortcomings of the monster show that there is nothing more than a piece of polystyrene. There is a fake magician struggling with a fake British accent (to make it seem more legitimate), two famous tenants, a penny "prehistoric cave", a pencil and an annoying banjo-pickin moose background. In a painful scene, the fake magician and his wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to pack the film in addition for 4 minutes by falling over the way stars can see in the night sky, even if it is clearly during the day. Even on a fast forward, this moovie hurts and hurts. MooCow says you call fumigators, because this cow pie really goes out! : = 8P
