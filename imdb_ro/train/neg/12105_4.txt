This was a disappointing film. People seem to have no substance, the protagonist Martin Cahil does not have zero redemption values, in fact, everyone in it, including Jon Voight, looks like blood. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is disastrous, though made with art. The film is black, at least the footprint I have seen in this category. A disappointment.
