I saw this movie at a pre-launch screening at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, filmmakers and filmmakers were present, probably to react. Many scenarios have caused laughter from the audience, which would have been good if it were a comedy, but it should have been a horror movie. If the audience was not scared, it seems that they were the ones who made the film. They delayed release for over a year. From curiosity, I saw her again to see if he would re-cut him; As far as I can say, they were not. It was the same terrible movie, just an elderly year. Almost qualifies as "so bad, it is good", but it is slow and boring.
