If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please do not give up the series. I bought my first copy of any book in May this year, and I'm almost done with Book 10. I dare say the movie is a piece of garbage that does not make the series even an odor of justice. While "Left: The Movie" follows only the story "Behind the Left" (the book), the characters are not even close to being accurate. Some examples: Rayford never acts for Hattie (is about to be informed about disappearances); Buck Williams is a blonde writer writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford and many of the details of Rayford's book wonder if she "survived"; Buck and Chloe meet only a long time later at a meeting in New York, set up by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," but rather in Rayford's retrospective thoughts; the roads are so twins packed with wrecks as a result of the kidnapping that Rayford and Hattie has to bring the helicopter to the suburbs ... etc. etc ... And that's only from the first movie; they are about to release the third one. Please, even if you did not like movies, give the card series a chance.
