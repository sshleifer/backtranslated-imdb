"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​a dreadful Woody Allen drama." And for good reason: they are Bergman's inexhaustible and pretentious imitations. And let's not deceive ourselves: critics have largely supported Allen's claims, Bergman, despite Allen's accusations being full of malice. What I do not understand is: why did Allen generally applaud for his originality in Bergman's imitation, but Brian DePalma was excited to "break" Hitchcock in his suspense / horror films? In Robin Wood's vision, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. I should agree with that.
