When I first saw this movie, I thought she should have come from the children's section - it's very fun and sometimes humorous, and it's really a good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I have to notice that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein's side, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the only exception. This movie seems a little forced, the direction has no substance and oh yes ... the music is terribly awful, I did not put myself in a very good condition. But if you do not expect a comedy story / smart, well-prepared love story, then this can certainly be fun, as I said .. it should be in the kids section. Einstein and his friends are a slight relief from Tim Robbins' mission, boring and almost tense, to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very controversial film, but as long as it's not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
