This is the most depressing film I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time as a child and I'm thinking about it right now. I know it was established at a time when life was tough and I know these people were poor and the cultures were vital. Yes, I have all this. What seems hard to take is that I do not remember a single moment of light in the whole movie. Maybe it was true for life, I do not know. I'm pretty sure the actor was in the top, and the direction and quality of the filming, etc., was great and I know every movie can not have a happy ending, but a family movie is horrible in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun with a movie. I can not emphasize how it affected this film as a child. I was talking about it recently, and all the sad memories came back. I think it would be something else than touching the heart for Prozac.
