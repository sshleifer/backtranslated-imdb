Ohhh brutality, ohhhhh dying dying, ohhhh feeling of loss, ohhhh bias! Jeez, when are you all the revisionists who will stop analyzing the Westerners to shout aloud? S ** t is happening. If you offend social sensitivities, then return to the comfort of the Meryl Steep collection. Dull, tiring and very tiring celluloid loss - especially in light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or interesting here, unless you are obsessed with the desert dentist in the 19th century. Perhaps it was a little better without the constant diversion of the Mexican out of place with the tooth. A monument to the ultra-left stupid sensibility of the 60/70 creepers. Virtually impossible to sit on the whole movie. I think I had my eyes open for the Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10 all dead in hell.
