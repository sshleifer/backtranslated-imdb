Steve McQueen certainly has a lot of loyal fans out there. He was certainly a charismatic colleague, one of the most charismatic that the big screen ever met. But even McQueen can not save this turkey of a movie, shot with what looks like a brownie room in the real locations of St. Louis. McQueen is a new boy who does not have a criminal record brought in planning a suspicion of banks by another band. There is more than a hint that there is a homosexual relationship between youngster Steve and David Clarke. I would not like all the other members of killings, mainly due to lack of criminal reversals. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something out, especially when she starts hanging with Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all the tough characters. That would surely awaken my suspicions. The big robbery of the Bank of St Louis had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim made a lot of documentary work, and Stix did nothing out of nothing. One of these two jokers decided that Steve's show was best served by making a bad imitation Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie may fall as the worst ever made by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed up for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would have it if they saw that. Or they have seen something the public should have overlooked except for the turkey dressing.
