A writer and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a private storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they think is the serial killer who terrorizes the city, "Costum Killer" (so called because, after injecting the victims with Windex, dresses them in silly costumes). They will convince him that his life story will make a wonderful film and bring together a group of filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of filming can be a crime. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie, but unfortunately it was left on the floor of the editing and showroom (the rumor is that the studio wanted a more open comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who do all the good jobs and deserve better), because it has an exceptional comedy, but it only rises to the sweet mediocre. If you are a fan of Ron Perlman deserves absolutely deserved just for his performance. His comedy time is excellent and he has the chance to make some very good impressions (he did not joke when he said in Hellboy's comment that he needs an intervention when entering Jerry Lewis mode). It's simply fun to watch in this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a role of two scenarios (but pivotal).
