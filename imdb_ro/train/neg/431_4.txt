Of course, I consider Al Pacino a guilty pleasure. He was a good actor until "Scent of a Woman", which seems to have been overwhelmed. We hoped that this movie, about which I would have heard almost nothing, was a beautiful jewel. A political, urban, polite and committed thriller. Is not. City Hall is a movie that blends the plot with so many characters, names and "realistic" city-level issues that for a while you think is such a large plot and involved that once you learn the truth, it will blow the mind. However, these subheadings and digressions ultimately result in well-known trade marks such as Corruption of Power, Two-Headed Politicians, Mafia with Police Connections, etc. And, theoretically, this configuration allows a thrilling voltage. fear that none of the characters is safe and that anything could happen! But again, really not. Unfortunately, the only things that are happening are quite predictable and we remain with more "confession" monologues that are designed to form a fabulous modern way, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the "real world" of politics, and society. But after 110 minutes of names and reports missing and a spider of lies and hiding places, the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfactory revelation. I do not think we were left with that in the City Hall, and while it's a very full movie, I do not find it very rich.
