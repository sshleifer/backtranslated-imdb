a good story, a good being ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say, but a vote 1 ... that's what it's worth, I think Chris Shadley might come up with a better finish. but maybe next time :) all this blood meaningless gore for nothing? the end would raise the story to almost 10, but not ... the end has ruined the whole story, I think most people are not llamarised and when it comes to a movie that you want a good end even if it's complicated ... but the only slick here is the end ... sorry
