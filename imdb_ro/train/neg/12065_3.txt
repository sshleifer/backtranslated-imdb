When I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought all the horror movies she could find and it was one of them. The VCR had just become a household item, and there were only 150 films and I watched everything from them. I was at a yard sale the next day and I saw this VHS copy of LEGACYI DE BLOOD and I buy any horror film I do not know and I knew this movie looks familiar. I thought about a second, and I realized it was one that my sister had bought. She sold it years ago in a yard sale I know - who knows. I did not remember anything about it and I saw it the night I bought it and it revived my memory from several scenes. I'm not sure how I felt like a child, but I'm sure I liked it because it was new to me and I'd look and enjoy something since then. I'm a strange horror, but there are certain requirements for me to consider it "good" and it has fallen very short. It was one of the talking talks and gave birth to death. What scenes of death you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and that if you are lucky you will get so much. The story is good and I've seen a few with similar plots, so I think it should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless you're too hard.
