And I was tricked into packing. And I fell for the gorilla packs and the DVD case that says "fans full of pain as every copy was pulled from the shelves." Although it was inexpensive ($ 6.99), it was not really what it deserves - it is not scary and very limited gore. The end was very cheesy and did not deliver the fist he should have. I do not even know how it became a "Nasty Video" as it is. The story pulls, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... do not respect the promise. The feature of the DVD bonus ("interview") is very strange, because the director seems very incoherent and not everything. The lead actress speaks of her appearing in Shakespearean production. It's a big laugh.
