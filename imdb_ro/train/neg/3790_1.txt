I do not post comments very much, but I wanted to make sure I warn the people on this movie. It is an unfinished student film without any redemption. At the technical level, it is completely amateur - unintentional constant editing in the scene, flourishing doubling, etc. The terrain is completely clichÃ©, the structure is ridiculous, and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too harsh: I did my part of student films and they were all terrifying, but there is no reason this movie to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> Alleged - like positive comments - are filming, friends and family.
