A movie that makes you want to throw your sword. I saw schlock in my time, but after seeing miserable mess, I do not think I'll ever forget another movie. May God be merciful to the souls who have done this. The premise - the ex-army of the silent type, underwear model (well-behaved) actually looks for the girl who sent him a Xmas card while serving in the army. She lives in her live-granola family, which is a right-hand logger. The family takes it and it takes two hours of our time to see that the chickens are a better trap than the liberal trap, the French wine drink, the porsche management, the talking of the mobile phone, the lazy, the city's polishing, the Jewish fiancÃ©. > <br /> Bad-1d characters, 1d themes. Being overhead with the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good advertising breaks have been long. Peter Jason. It's over.
