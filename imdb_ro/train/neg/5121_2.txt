I entered this film thinking that it would be a pure football drama (in the same sense as the Titans' memory); however, I came to feel like I just attended a Ted Haggard sermon on the Rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the film. In fact, perhaps someone could gain more from a television sermon than a poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the TV sermon, there are Scripture quotes rather than quotes from the popular pulp of self-help. The plot was totally too predictable until anyone who had a period of sufficient attention could have exposed the entire plot in the first 15 minutes of the film.
