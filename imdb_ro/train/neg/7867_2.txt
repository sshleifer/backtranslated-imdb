Okay, I tried and tried, but I did not get this Guy Maddin. The stories of Gimli hospital left me cold, the movie about the Austrian villagers and the Ice Nymph were quite attractive, but they are missing in the stories department ... and this nude film about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad Maddin has an appreciation for the silent film, but I do not like his films for the same reason I do not like Quentin Tarantino's films: they're empty homage to better and more imaginative films - movies that have advanced the form of new art soil - and are all style and no substance. No amount of unusual room cuts and angles might hide the fact that Maddin is an innocent David Lynch wannabe, although he has no advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films are based on INTERTIM. Bottom line is, Maddin's schtick is a clever smart movie for most aspiring movies.
