This is the official continuation of the SF SF thriller in 1992. Originally, Van Damme was among some Vietnam war veterans rebellious to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this case, I think, about a dozen years later, because Van Damme has a daughter of that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified facility to train the last Unisols - called Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the supercomputer on the site (called Seth - like the snake in King Cobra of the same year) goes madly strong, takes over the Unisols command and even downloads its computer brain into a new super- Unisol (Jai White). We look at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme's battles are particularly great, Unisol (pro Goldberg fighter), who continues to return: give up on a building - it's not good; run it with a truck - it does not work! Shoot it, burn it - look it up! Much of the humor is being watched on how Van Damme is now outdated and classified (he even turns gray around the edges). But, although he takes a lick, he continues to lose! Most such sequelae are pretty blades - the pale imitation of the original, and while it is certainly not a stroke of genius, it manages to be constantly fun, especially if you are a pro-wrestling fan .
