After seeing the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show is bad. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but he should have shot him in California, so we'd have scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene out there in another world is in the mountains, with a lot of pins in which it looks cold. That does not feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting strangers in a Canadian field. And it is so lame that on other planets the fall comes as well. You can see foliage in the fortifications that all look like land outside Vancouver. It even makes the show even more incredible and worse. <br /> <br /> And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. It's not Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and tries to copy Russels's performance a bit, but he's not as cool as Russell. And not such an actor as Russell. And Russell's way of playing O Neill was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, it's too soft. I liked the fact that the Russels version just did not give a s *** and had no trouble bombing the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson, although taking over from James Spader. Teal'c is a very annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard with a pathetic Ra, seen only in the pilot and in another episode so far. Teal'c speaks and behaves like a robot. I saw a better adventure by Jean Claude Van Damme. And the fact that Teal'c and the character Ra and the people they have saved in the film, I can speak English at once is also incredibly stupid. What made terrible extraterrestrials in the movie was that they were talking an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are very good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the current show are badly made and look cheap. Especially a planet she's visiting with crystals. It is so obvious that he is walking on a sound scene with a bad painting in the background. It is an insult to our viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when he could have done it in front of a blue screen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> X files had better effects when they released their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 began. And they did not have an apparent budget of two million dollars per episode, which SG-1 would have had. They must have spent all the money for catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and useless show that could have been great if it had launched the Hollywood show with a larger budget and better writers and better characters.
