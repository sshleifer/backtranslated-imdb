The weak performances of Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Underdeveloped support characters rough. Annoying young man with no real plot. Ending the leaves is more pleasant than a pancake, with more free heads than you could bind in four sequels (that is, if you cared for these wood characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. The penultimate sequence in which the "hood in Chicago" is looking for the Sinatra character is ridiculous. The music in that sequence is also weak. And in the final stage when Martin's character removes his hat for the woman he calls "pig," he almost made me go out and find a stone to cast through my television screen.
