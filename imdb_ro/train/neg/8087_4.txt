The film has no credibility with helicopters that existed only in the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The only part of the film you could think of is that Germany would like to know where the landing will be. Ignore the moment the British captured all the spies, but even if they did not, they would not let them walk so as to reassure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It's not an important thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the wrong things that make the movie fail. Poor targeting, wrong scenarios, no attempt at authenticity (at all) all combine to make the film collapse. Generally, spies should disappear into wood. Suspension comes with the spy asking if the information they have is valid or not and worrying that they are detected. This game has ended from the beginning. This spy was nothing but spying. Your only chance to get something that has some credibility and instills some suspicion can be reading the book.
