"The Crush" is a pretty good story for friends from the age of 40, for the first two thirds, because it's trying to be a "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I was especially pleased with the return of the young man's trophy trophy whose character is not much fleshed out (let's think we have not seen so much of his physical flesh and he and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more). <br /> <br /> Of course I do more than a young man / older woman than it was made from the opposite of every version of "Sabrina" (no movie I do not like) or, for that, with Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Svengali Nuptials. Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex bed otherwise are familiar with British dramas and comedies such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The park twists towards the end of the year feel very deus ex machina. But it was not until the credits came by the end of the year when I figured out what could really be wrong. As in the case of "Sex and the City", the writer / director is male, here, the first writer John McKay and I think he really wanted to make a screenplay about three homosexual men, probably coming to them about lovers and in the workplace (the characters are the school principal, the policeman and the doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting film. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which was even more parallel with the Broken Hearts Club paradigm. (Original Written 4/6/2002)
