First of all, let me pretend this post saying I am a fan of the original moves FILMS moves ... I do not read books, play games, wear underwear or eat grains (if there is one). I'm just a fan of the movies. With what I said, I'm trying to see how I give this film so much praise. By doing this film by itself and not comparing it with its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say that this is an amazing film. For all the terrible deficiencies in the scenario - the dialogue with cheeses, the scenes made (for example, R2 is suddenly a badass and long scenes of intense CGI tracking that have a small human touch), HORRIBLE acts and writes plot holes ... this good thing? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; it seemed that a shifter was overturned and was suddenly hurt. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which was ruined by "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein). When BOMBARD screen with incredible CGI effects and fill gaps with absolutely atrocious gaskets, when it could have been and should have been said more, this is NOT LARGER. For a movie with such a "dark" tone, there was too much light in the speech of all the characters. Ending with a question: from the beginning to the end of the movie, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was going to happen in reality?
