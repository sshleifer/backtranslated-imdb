This direct-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis's career. Like Disney's tradition, quality is sacrificed on behalf of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy residence, and Moranis accidentally collides with some relatives so he can repeat all the best scenes in the original movie. Due to the unbeatable visual effects and scary dialogue abounds in this brown lazer, who did nothing but make me pins for his "The Incredible Man Shrinking" when this was done properly. Shockingly, it is directed by the best cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stay in the day job or pick the material better next time.
