Here's what happened: 1) BBC3 head has to make programs for the public different from BBC1 and BBC2 to keep the license and the job. 2) Lenny Henry offers his unfunny friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The BBC3 head blocks them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. The worst of all is undoubtedly racist, the characters play up to bad stereotypes. If a white person would do such things, it would be a waste!
