No, I'm not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be out of the studio. I am serious. Their films are exactly the same in each, and consist only of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem that they easily solve, hoping to be popular and getting new lovers. Think about this. If you've ever seen a movie with a different plot, contact me and tell her the name. These "movies" are poor excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There is a reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure when they were very young and did some O.K. movies, a head of the studio has bought all rights for 15 years or something, so now they can make movies in other countries whenever they want to use the studio's money. Allow me to advise you, to stay away from MARY-KATE and ASHLEY! It's for your good good!
