Maybe it's not my kind, but the plot was horrific as Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino acted. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of being seduced here (while on marijuana? Why did he have to be included? This plot was considerably weakened). The character of Farentino. it would have been better if he had more respect for a relationship. Would anyone want the movie? not too much.
