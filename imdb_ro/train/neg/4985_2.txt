In 1993, "visitors" were an enormous blow to France. So the sequence was inevitable and, unfortunately, this sequence is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not respect its promises. Indeed, one should say a single story. Jean Reno must go to the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back to the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow his course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely out of the world of the twentieth century, making him return to the Middle Ages is quite difficult ... Instead, the film goes on several other stories without succeeding the main plot. As a consequence, the movie sometimes becomes clogged, sometimes a bit of misery. But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that they could have avoided in the first film: they go head-to-head and become annoying. Then, why did Jean-Marie Poiré, the filmmaker, involve Muriel Robin as the main role of women? He made a mistake because he seems to be stupid and is totally pitiful. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent, and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. Of course, the movie contains some good moments with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also appears naked because Poiré takes back elements that have secured the success of the first film. So a young woman takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks her to take part in her wedding. A follow-up worked and disappointing. However, what is the interest of this otherwise commercial film? <br /> <br />
