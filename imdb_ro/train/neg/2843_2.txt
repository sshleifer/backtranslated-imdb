Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a capricious ninja movie, horrible, makes no mistake. But it is also an incredibly pleasant one. This is largely due to the wonderful presence of a Chuck Connors, which is charged as the main role in the film, but it really shines only in a few scenes. I suppose it should be a guy Obi Wan Kenobi ("hard ninja buster," exclamates the copy of the box), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration. But, indeed, his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, have so horrible dialogue that Brooklyn, as we call Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Watch Dennis's logic in particular about the "genetic link" involved with Sakura. If you know something about cloning, you'll die laughing. And yes, this is an important point of plot, folks. An extraordinary fun movie, Sakura Killers, is a hard-to-find gem. I will not hurt the "trick" that ends for you, except that it is a perfect set for a Sakura 2 killer. Too bad Chuck Connors has died. :-( Because it has the finest ways to remove the ninja.
