This film does not contain humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes have reminded me too graphically from my own life experience. This movie was the human version of "dear mother". Describes both the graphical life and the exact life of many children of a mentally ill parent. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and behave as if he were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was funny. Under no circumstances, I say! It is the best sick humor. <br /> <br /> The film is so intense and depressing that my son and I have to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not think what we actually do to our families.
