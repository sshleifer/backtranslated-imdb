Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a comfortable star-like vehicle to convey his appeal to black and white audiences, updates the 1978 "Heaven Can Wait" comedy with an urban agenda. He plays a comedian struggling with a car accident that has his soul removed too soon from his body - consequently, his angels must find another body to put him in and he can only come with a white businessman . The rewriting of a film as gentle and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" shows only that Rock's eye was on the box office (this was strictly a corporate move by the most mercenary Hollywood players). Why not strive for something taller or more memorable than a bad reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at Apollo? (Including King Queen Queen, marvelous Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and terrible Frankie Faison) are doing everything they can, but Rock seems uncomfortable and uncertain of himself. * 1/2 from ****
