I never liked Myra, because I appreciate how he pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Of course, the Miss Welch costume has become an iconic image, although I have to wonder if many people who recognize the picture have really seen the movie and know what it is all about. I reassembled Myra on the FMC a few years ago and did not think it aged for years. There is a segment about it in Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History cartoons, where appropriate credit is given to put such big stars in what was then a scandalous production. However, IMHO, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, or have fun ---
