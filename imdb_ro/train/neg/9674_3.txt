This movement reminds me of really bad science-fiction movies from the 1950s and 1960s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, cheesy and stupid. The special effects are ridiculous, all the actors are absurd and the conclusion is simply terrible. lose money, rent or buy something better. I give 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite funny because of its stupidity).
