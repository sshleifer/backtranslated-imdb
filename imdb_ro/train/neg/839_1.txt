The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least what we lost was $ 3.00 and spent the time spent in this bomb. Continuing crew member missed the boat. When the female leadership and the type of FBI went to the supposed place of the murderers, the FBI handed the woman a revolver. When the alleged murderer came out on the door, the revolver turned into a magical way. One is left to wonder if a FBP agent would give a gun to a civilian? I do not think. Ms. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's too bad for the R rating to allow much of it to be seen. It seems that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film.
