This movie deserved to work at The Mystery Theater. Even if it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it's worth an hour because it's an unintentional laugh. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters". Make sure you have checked the following: the cheese medallion (shows that Shriners were here), obviously the Norfolk polyester jacket on Allan Quatermain, the stomach of David MaCallum, which drew attention from its even worse, the incredibly stupid process works on all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the girl's hand puppet that threatens the little girl, the giant snake that threatens Macallum while sinking in oatmeal, red eyes on motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!) to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dune and looks like a remnant from an Jr. ("Voyage in the Future with the '71" class), the Phoenician city - where it bears the Roman imperial armor, but inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - to come!), and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her terrible wig) playing in the face of unshakable - oh, horror! The best part is that good explorers manage to lose the French comic, and the African guy - Snuffleupagus or anything else - obviously chose to die heroically rather than be in other scenes.
