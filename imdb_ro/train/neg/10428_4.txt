Someone else felt betrayed like me? The first hour was pretty solid, but the last. Oh God. It looked like cheese was also predictable. It's not gorgeous and epic, just like the whole run of the show. Most reviews they read were brilliant, but I really can not understand why. I seriously forewarned that the general had concluded WAY earlier but then withdrew it because I thought, "No, she would never do that, she's too reckless." I can not wait. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm about to get out on the door to go to every season I have. Somebody please. Change my mind. I want to love this. So bad. Somebody tell me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible termination.
