I read reviews before watching this movie and I did not believe them. I like horrible movies and I expected it to be average. It was not. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like the best. The movie contains a bad act, a faint sound, a bad mood, an unpleasant makeup - and it bored me so much that I stopped it. even nudity was garbage! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did. You can say if you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good googgy movie go watch toxic revenge 4 or even blood camp. Avoid this garbage - I saw it on TV and I felt stingy, so you do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
