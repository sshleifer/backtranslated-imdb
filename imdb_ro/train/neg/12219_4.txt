It was a weird movie. It started quite well. A solid piece behind the flash of gore and chaos as our psychopath did his stuff. His next come "down to the autumn" Here I could tell him that I was for a real cheese film "B". Can it act, I mean how hard it is to hold a gun and behave like a cop? These guys could not. After the death of our psychopath, we get the opening credit and the movie starts ... From this point of view, it's about big boobs who do badly on a blood hole and poorly executed death scenes. <br /> <br /> That said that I gave a four film because, despite its flaws, it kept some kind of anger that I just could not quite shake off. I do not recommend this movie, but I have to admit that I find it worse.
