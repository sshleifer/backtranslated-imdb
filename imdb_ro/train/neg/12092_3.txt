I fail to recognize Haneke's ability to overcome the film. For example, I appreciate having left the unparalleled daily settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, as far as the content of this film is concerned, I find it very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a desire to patologize relations or feelings of domination-obedience (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is insignificant, as Walter's alienation and misunderstanding (I do not mean the frustration of a loved one who is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; she looks at her as if she were crazy, or as if she were a monk, come on!). I mean D / s is not something new in the world and I think it's rather stupid to treat the subject as if it were something "weird" or pathological; is not. In general, films dealing with this subject are really insufficient in the face of time. That is why, for me, do I feel that this film ends up being a rather scheduled film, worried about the very old psicoanalitic theories, is not it shameful?), And that does not really refer to real life and the experiences of those dealing with D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, discussion rooms, even recent academic studies will show this).
