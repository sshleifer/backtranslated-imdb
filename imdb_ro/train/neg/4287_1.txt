I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave it to him 1 The story is very boring and does not have much to do with the original Timecop. A lot of things from Timecop have been dismantled, and instead they've put in new things. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason, timetraveling is now more dangerous: confusing: And action scenes are nothing to please, most of them are not ... just the first it's great ... and there are not many scenes of action, and all are pretty short <br /> <br /> At some point in the story, the main character travels through about 5 times in a few minutes ... no wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: Do not waste time watching this movie is not worth it
