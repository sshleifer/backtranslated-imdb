I watched this today, partly attracted to the distribution of all stars, and partly because I enjoyed so many other movies of this film. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenarios, where continuity does not leak, for example, the challenge of billiards at first. The scenes of fighting with locals are as good as you remember in those old Tarzan black and white movies, you know where you see a spear flying through the air and the room cuts a native dead standing on the floor, his thigh. Is instant death? There are also several rather useless scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as if the little girl is saved while collecting flowers. Too bad animated clay toys are too painful to look. If you see this movie, the crabs that stand in front at about 5 kilometers per hour are highlighted. Somehow I manage to face David McCullum and give him a shot. As if there is no time to get out of the way, as when the city obelisk collapses, the native always has the world to take a step to the left, but he does not cry out. Give me only 2 because of Ekland . And why does McCullum's voice develop a stutter while the movie progresses?
