Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings had a profound influence on my life as a Christian and I anticipated that I was seeing this film and that I learned more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film has been divided ... has not provided any background on his life, no historical context, and nothing about his great writings (except for a brief reference to "The Cost of Discipline" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we see them enjoy jazz (apparently in states) and cool down with their friends before deciding to go back to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part he stands up for for his faith. Instead of highlighting this, we have a very bad story with a 17 year old school. Whether or not it was, it should not have been an important part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part or narratives explaining what his writings were about ... or GIVING to make us know a little about the greatness of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is a kind of movie that gives Christian Films a bad name. All they had to do was create a structure to watch the movie, with a certain background ... even some voices or retrospectives for him preaching from his deeds ... a narrative of who he was and where he had been. But no ... this is what we have. It does not match too much with a hero of faith.
