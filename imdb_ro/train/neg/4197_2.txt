The film does not have a good, unclear story, slow images and movements, where the least is needed: adrenaline is all that should not be a movie. Georgina Verbaan (a Dutch soap actress who did not participate in her English courses) plays rich girl Freya, who has the habit of searching for "thrill." What routinely makes stunning stunts, breaks things up and disturbs people. And not in a fun way Jackass. Then it's Dracko (Rivas). He's doing pretty well, but he has other illegal activities. Then is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And finally, I took Jason (debutant Fyall), Freya's friend. One day, Freya has disappeared and everyone seems to be involved, but we, the viewer, do not care about anybody's distribution is either enjoyable or credible, and the story makes no sense. Why was this really done? 2/10.
