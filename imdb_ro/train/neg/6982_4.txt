The stunning story of the American revolution. When farmer "Tom Dobb" (Al Pacino) and his son arrive in the port of New York, they are immediately inscribed by the street bumper Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox? After being cut off by bits of British cannons, Tom and his son are immediately condemned by the sympathizer of Continental Army "Nastisja Kinski" for "not lifting the earth." Following this Kodak moment, there are a number of digressive chapters, including Tom's participation in a "foxhunt", in which he has to wear a model of "old poor Georgie Washington" filled in effigy while running from a the English laced lazy trap (Manning Redwood) and having a barbecue with a group of Iroquois Indians, while they plan the best way to slip back into battles, so Al and his ingraded kid can hit the courage of the assassin of British officer Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique movie style and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial fog in London, but scenarios painting of redcoats as bad monsters reveals once again the patented hatred of the British Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as an American soldier enrolled.
