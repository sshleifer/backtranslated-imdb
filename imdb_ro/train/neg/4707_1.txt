GMO was the most painful experience of my life looking at me. I could even finish what happens to Nick. The best thing that Teen Nick has is Drake and Josh, and that's about to get out of the air. Children's songs are pretty annoying, and so are the children. My younger sister wanted to watch the show because she likes everything that comes to Disney or usually, but when she finished watching this show she said "one of the worst performances I've ever seen so boring" . My brother actually fell asleep, I envy him. Briefly, if you are 3 years of age without brain activity you will enjoy this show, otherwise you will change the channel now.
