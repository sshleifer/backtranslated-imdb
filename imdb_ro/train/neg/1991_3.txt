So what is the great thing to do an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who is expressed as a fictional guy from adventure stories that does not want to go out in an adventure ??? Who wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for all the reasons, this movie is very excited! That does not mean she has no action, but she looks at the dark side of the image. This has no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other adventures of action and adventure containing cliffhangers and narrow leaks and JAKE SPEED has been promoted in this way using intelligent propaganda to make myself and others interested in it! Besides, I've never heard of that guy, who needs his attention?
