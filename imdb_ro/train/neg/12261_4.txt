Standard "paint by numbers" monster fare, filled with a bunch of routine plotting devices from big creatures. It's as if someone had a pack of plotting ideas from other films written on them that were mixed and divided. Any plot lines and characters appeared in the business were then thrown into the scenario. <br /> <br /> The characters are so brilliant that you can play a game of "Guess who gets like a monster table" in less than ten minutes in the movie and you probably get every right as right - including order in which will be devoured. Many of the characters are so inappropriate that your roots so the creature closes them. Some of the main characters include: a Billy Idol clown that sails with sharks, a strong battle that blinks bancrolls, a Capt. Ahab with a vendetta and Ahab's girlfriend dancing at a bar. Oh, and a big big beast who needs anger management therapy. Along the way, people have a great deal of support, beautiful girls running in wet t-shirts, couples doing exotic beaches, explosions are the ruins of an altar, and pirates confronted with fat sink. <br /> <br /> Funny, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the lack of character characters when other people were killed. After a violent death, they make jokes with a single line. Almost I can hear shots from the edges. Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose and want to laugh at such a bad movie, it's fine. Otherwise, you may want to skip it.
