I felt I watched this movie thousands of times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to wander a little, every time I expected something interesting, I could only see what I was expecting. As "The Bread Factory opened another unit, because there was not enough bread". Two words: The flat story, which became a clich√©, a bad action, bad bad effects ... Only the Russian cop, Vlad, was a little funny while punishing the bad guys. The grave of the muscles was so incredibly stupid, that it makes me laugh for a moment. I wonder why I lost my time spitting on that shameful movie ... You will not get worse (because it's not possible): D
