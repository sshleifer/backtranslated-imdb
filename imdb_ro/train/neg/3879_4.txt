Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course it's a horror movie, things get ugly and he returns to Earth as the only survivor. Broken by a bizarre state that makes him slowly melt and lose his mind if he does not usually consume human flesh, he kills what seems to be the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring city to shoot more victims. /> I liked the premise, and the monster and gore effects are actually pretty good, but space scenes are just stuck together from NASA material, and the hospital seems curious as a warehouse. A very poor scenario, a small character development, and a poor general action prevent him from rising above anything other than a mediocre movement of the slasher with the novelty of having a living candle as a murderer and more or less just its effects gore Interest. 4 out of 10, strictly for the sweetest fans of the monster movie.
