Disney has still met a movie where she could not do at least two sequels. And this was not an exception to the Disney people to give a poor story to get a quick reward. Somehow, though I did not pay to see it, I feel cheaper by observing it. Ariel is growing up now and has a daughter. However, it does not allow the daughter to enter the sea because of a certain threat unaffected by the deceased witch's sister. So here we go again. The daughter is deceived (of course) and helps the witches of the sea. After such a glorious struggle, she is defeated, and sirens and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to be seen here. Go back to your lives. "D-"
