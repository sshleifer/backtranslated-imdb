My complaints relate to the rhythm of the film and the materials at hand. While using the film and archive letters, the film offers a fresh and interesting perspective, often the material selected to highlight is simply not very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this disease or a disease, a small city of German origin). The film also crawls along the cover of 1920-1939 and then steamed during the war. In conclusion, the film is a bit better than a History Channel documentary, except that the director has a slightly greater sensitivity than the average documentary editor of the historical channel, and can thus arrange detailed Goebbels' life. Still, I realized he wanted to.
