Okay, do not let it trick you. This SUCKS HARD movie. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible in ways people should not hide their brains to describe them. Under no circumstances is it worse than Manos: hands of fate, hobbobblins, spider horrors or a small handful of movies. As a review the movie is shit, it's terrible. You do not see it without MST or you can develop health problems. But there are also worse movies.
