I was very much convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: 1) This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen 2) If it does not receive more reviews, it will not be listed the worst movies - which deserve to be 3) I was lucky - I paid five pounds for her. I saw her in stores for 15 pounds. You do not pay much for this movie! You will be very angry 4) There are a lot of horror movies out there that have not got a fair rating (in my opinion) and giving this movie a higher rating than it is a criminal. <br /> <br /> Summary of the chart: A guy who has no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear to anyone else like someone else. Our hero turns cunning into a teenager and joins their gang - sitting on swings, sitting. He kills them one by one until they are followed and found by the police. Why is that so bad? To start with acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any action I've seen on a school scene. I bought a number of previously banned movies from the vipco DVD and I was not as disappointed as I was. well, the act is bad, but the movie fails to deliver in any other sense. What was the point in making this film when there is not even a gore! well, without gore. What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, not even a dentist! It is true that this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness, but any potential buyer / supervisor of this film should be fairly informed that this film is at best worth just one in ten .
