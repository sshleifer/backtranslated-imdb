I watched the DVD tower last night for something to watch. I was between NetFlix emails and it was a quiet night on Saturday. I pulled one that I never heard of and I realized it was borrowed from a friend. From the jacket, it sounds like a rupture of "Big Chill," but, with the cast of all the stars, he felt it would be worth watching. The boy was wrong! Not only was it like "Big Chill," but it was an almost perfect character. Bill Paxton's character was a copy of William Hurt ("where you've been all the time") - a spiral warning - and he's still behind to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I was wondering why I was just looking at these people. Developing inadequate characters did not allow me to find any interest in them. How did "Unca Lou" find these characters even after 20 years? In addition, it was not even funny, unless Perkins fell, erred from bed the first morning, was a sign and I lost it. When it is over, I asked my wife, "Did there any characters in this movie? ... sleep there?" She said, "No, I'm still thinking ... No, no one can think."
