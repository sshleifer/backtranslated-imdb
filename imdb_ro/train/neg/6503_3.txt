What Hopkins succeeds with this effort of writer and director gives us a feeling that we do not know absolutely anyone in the movie. However, there is probably the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and extracted from the very deep inside, but it is so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who he is, so there is no investment on our part. It could be a scriptwriter who mixes with his characters. It is? May be. By this I do not mean Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean nothing says. Hopkins' film is an experiment. In front of her it can be said that it is a screenwriter who, even when he meets fate, realizes that life is struck and lacking, and success is a blind chance, as it is thrown into a "sliding "of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts and reality. However, it is so brainless that it leaves no room for any indication of emotion, even to the small size, quite rudimentary to allow us to connect with its characters. and the flamboyant school of film and editing machines for editing and filming machines disengaged me, but reflecting the film, I begin to realize that it has much to do with it. There are so many films of the last decade when the cuts or movement of the camera have sound effects, as well as other technical doodles that deteriorate in the atmosphere. I suppose that in this case it was justified that his purpose was to compose the Impressionist response of dreams. However, I did not know anything about Slipstream when I was watching it and I went out the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins did not make any effort to make us care. There are interactive movies, and there are movies sitting in a rocking chair and knit, not knowing of your presence. Slipstream is the last one.
