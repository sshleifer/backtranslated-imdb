Absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish is not fun at all. The character of lead played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. Editing by E.T and star wars is simply stupid. Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only one who thinks well about this film. She should master her English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with its qualities. Apart from Goksal this film is a garbage. Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is the worst piece of work written this time. Cem Karaca's music is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Sumer Tilmac also has a presence. The actor who plays the three sons has no talent so much.
