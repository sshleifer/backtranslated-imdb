I was taken care of by a family of three small children for one night and my mother gave me this to show that they took it to Wal-Mart at the beginning of the week. All three children became physically ill while watching him. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all took away from school, but it really could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How can someone produce this garbage gauge is beyond me. Fortunately, we deactivated the movie when I noticed that children were not responding but acting strangely. For any parents there, I recommend that you refrain from letting young children view this movie.
