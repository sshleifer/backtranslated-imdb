I lost the beginning of this movie, which could explain why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, I studied the fall of the Roman republic for years, so I know the story. Again, this could be the reason why I did not like this movie. The film has more historical inaccuracies than extracts. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they tried to be fair, in which case it can be forgiven. The odd thing is, sometimes, that great efforts are being made to be historically correct, that it leads to confusion. Like casting Antonius' marriage to Octavia, then pushing her away two scenes later. Why to bring it even if it has no purpose for plotting and Octavia is never seen? And as if you called Antonius by his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his foreign English name Mark Antony in other scenes. Although historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still be a fun watch if it was not for the lady leader. There is no ounce of dignity in it. It is hysterical, dramatic and without control over it. Instead of being a clever and composed Queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad PMS case. 95% of which comes from bad action, but 5% is also from poor scripts. Too many dramatic dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you did not look at Antonius and Cleopatra, you look at immature versions of Dawson and Joey in Dawson's Creek. If you want to look at something about this period,.
