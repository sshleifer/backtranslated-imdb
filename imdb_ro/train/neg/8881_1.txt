The character that acts is a bit stiff, as if it were the first time the actor appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (played several bits on TV, as in the Star Trek TNG and in the night heat), dies fast and then acts it can be missed significantly. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, as presented by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this film with body language for most of the time. He does not make a poor job, but it's a little too much to ask an actor to connect the oceans of free time during which characters spend their time NOT talking and also DO NOT act. Robertson's most memorable role may be Ben Parker in the last three films Spider Man (with Tobey Maguire). Plot is predictable. A husband kills his rich wife for her money. then his wife seems to be coming back and haunts his driving husband to mad him until he jumps from a large window (fearing the spectrum of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is expected to die no less . <br /> <br /> The second driver Mr. Ballard is very much like an English brand Hamill. Uncanny indeed! The only thing that is highlighted is the total lack of dialogue. Many minutes pass quietly, no one speaks, and few act. It's a shame that MST3K guys have never done this movie. It could have been much better if it was not as predictable, with more dialogue, or shorter scenes of "nullity." <br /> <br /> We are still waiting for G'Mork's red eyes to appear out of the shadows and proclaim that he works for "nothing" living in this film.
