The film of this film contains some of New Zealander's best actors, many of whom I have seen in fabulous roles, but this film fills me with profound shame just to be from the same country as they do. The false accents of Americans are the first indication that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review remarks pretty well, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old ferry, decorated with several multi-colored flags stolen from a batch of used cars. Most of the casting seems to come from (poor) soap in New Zealand Shortland Street. It's as if this movie had been dreamed of a Christmas party at Shortland Street, the result of too much gins and possibly a little salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" meets "Love Boat," organized by the local primary school and directed by an autism, and you get the idea. If you are an actor, I recommend that you see this movie as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
