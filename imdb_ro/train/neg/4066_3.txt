Under Eric Stanze's "ISOYC, IPOYG," three men are subjected to torture in the hands of a woman they have sexually abused. The first victim is forced to anger the crap before being put to death. The next one ends with a bullet in his legs after he refused to have anal sex with the body of the first guy. But it is the third man who makes her worse: she has to look at Emily Haack, tattooed with empty tattoos, and masturbate with a broom handle (oh, he also takes his hand tightly)> <br /> And unfortunately, so do we (you can see masturbates, because "you do not get a broom in our hands!"). Yes, "ISOYC, IPOYG" is a spectacular viewing experience, not because of its unrelenting violence, but because Haack, who is obviously under the mistaken idea of ​​having a goddess's body (unlike that of a Metallica roadie) becomes constant for the camera. It's not a beautiful sight. In addition to the non-stop nudity from a haack-up Haack, viewers also get to see the awful direction from Stanze (who believes endless photos of funerary stones and trees is a thing of entertainment), some really bad action and the penis of a type of fat. Very strange, they give "ISOYC, IPOYG" a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 on average. This is a point for the dirty attack of the ax (which, being a gore dog, I actually enjoyed it); a point for the small place where the type of fat makes its face pushed into chocolate foam that flies like hives; and a point for the nerve to suggest that this movie might somehow be a continuation of the superior exploitation of Meir Zarchi, the classic I Spit On Your Grave.
