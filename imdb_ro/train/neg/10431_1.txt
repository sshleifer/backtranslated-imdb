I liked the first season. The quality fell a little in the second season, but it still had a very big means (Pegasus!). The third season was quite novel and original and it was OK. The fourth season began to go down quickly because they never started to give us explanations when we started to need them now. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were two Cylon factions? What was Angel-Kara's goal to lead the fleet to a devastated Earth? What kind of past had the last five Cylons and how did they survive or were reincarnations? Questions everywhere answer nowhere. And then the end comes. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Well, okay. But destroying the fleet? By giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and spreading a few thousand people on thin paper on the planet? This is not just anti-science, it is anti-rational and anti-life. And the philosophy of the performance seems to be when mankind is caught in a cycle that goes from the romanticism of nature to a decadent capitalist society that invents an AI destruction process. which ruins everything. It is visionless, hopeless for a deeper future for mankind, and is anti-science for science fiction. And do not even put my angels on me! Religious crack of the worst type! Final disappointment! Everything "all this happened before, and it will happen again" should have been related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to the Earth as we know it. Making the new show in a way consistent with the old would have been the definitive genius accident. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
