I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved Evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that Uma's character will be thrown by Luke. Thus, the accumulation is evident when the superpowers unleash it. But the salary is not there. The shark's rise managed to get a (slight) chicot, but once again, it was still in the trailer. No one has breath that Uma and Luke is the Owen diet in his good days. If not for Riann Wilson you stay there with a constipated smile until your cheeks begin to crack. It's a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible-it's just like an old cock behind the fridge. This could have been a kind of brilliant send-up of superhero and feminism movies, but it does not succeed on both counts. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save his surname.
