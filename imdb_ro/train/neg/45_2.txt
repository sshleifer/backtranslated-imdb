As the number of Nasties Video I still see decreases, this little pile of rubbish appeared on my list to rent when I saw it was available. The premise involved a fashion model or something kidnapped and taken to the jungle to be redeemed by an idiot crew. Several others are committed to bringing it back and given a bag of money to use as a bargaining chip, although if it comes back with the girl and all the money it gets a significant cut. He brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, the pilot is one of the worst EVER actors! Suddenly, I'm totally terrible, and doubling will make you cry. After we steal in the jungle, we learn that there is a cannibal worship nearby, whose earthly god with terrible earth wanders in the forest like a human king Kong, seeking to devour and devour the tribes. Now this guy is just an empty guy, with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for the eyes and that's pretty much. His hands and his groans are a continuous feature on the soundtrack and I woke up moving many of these scenes. Oh, I forgot to mention almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was forbidden, although there is a specific scene, about a long second, in which the god attacks a girl and pulls her courage but is not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond T and A is accustomed and presents long notes of female genitalia and, unfortunately, men. So if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you get it. I can not recommend this trash bin to anyone. It's not really bad movie. It's just a trash that has fallen carefully just that a Nasty Video fan will probably see and even then, if you make your way through the list, leave this for the last one. If you follow it first, you can get the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
