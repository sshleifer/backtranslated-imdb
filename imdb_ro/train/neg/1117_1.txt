I do not know what this movie really is about. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark except for seconds per day. There are long fires, interrupted by insects of all kinds, for no reason. What little dialogue exists in the movie is as inediting and meaningless as the pictures. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow, she gets pregnant overnight, then she's shot in her head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon, after which a naked white woman appears. I have never been so blasphemed by how bad and useless it can be a movie. Honestly, I'd like someone to look at her so she can tell me what she thinks it is. But I would not want this level of hell anybody else.
