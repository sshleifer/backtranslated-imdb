Well, the previews looked funny and usually do not go to the movies on the opening night, especially with my kids, because ... ... you never know. Here's a movie that does not appeal to children or adults, because jokes are too perverse for children and fall completely for adult entertainment purposes. In fact, I was embarrassed to be aged 9 and 6 and explain to her 6 years what S H * T said. Essentially, what is happening here is a complete twist of the classic Dr. Seuss. Adds a bad and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the baby's mother for her money. If it was a subplot, then maybe it would be good, but eventually it will be the main plot around the whole movie and the "cat" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mother for who she really is. Take my advice, read the book, and forward the movie.
