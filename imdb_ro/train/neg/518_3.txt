Bela Lugosi is not featured in this fantastic twelve-time adventure series, starring Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as the White Magic force-backed opponent against Black while displaying a vigorous ability struggling looking at a young Egyptian princess and cutting off a light figure and beaten in yachting gear, complete with the nautical cover. A strange plot hires Chandler / Chandu into a series of escapades that have led to the rescue of his fianc√©, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and other idol-ubasti idiot clutches, revitalizing an ancient mummified princess buried on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Ray Taylor, an old hand on such fun, keeps the events moving sharply but repeats scenes and recordings, much of which is found on the island of Skull Island last year at KING KONG, and the port of SON OF KONG, reduces the original action to less than 60 minutes from the broadcasting length of the series over two and a half hours, and if viewed at a meeting, it becomes irrelevant to most viewers, except in the case of insomniac.
