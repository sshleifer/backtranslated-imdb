If you like a Syfi soap, this show is for you as a fare as I'm worried it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes, I can no longer follow it. It's boring and slow and for a show that chronology is based about 100,000 years ago, if you relied on the Battlestar Galactica chronology because you arrived on the ground, they seem to have all the same stuff around like the Chevy 100,000 who are going down the streets and people watching the 100,000-year-old brand names of LCD TVs. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well as on the show, it's just a big part of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook, I think it could have done a lot better than a job to address these issues and give galactica battlestar had some of the same problems, but not nearly as bad. As a fare as the rest of the show, it's not as good as BSG and it was a bad pre-sequel to it.
