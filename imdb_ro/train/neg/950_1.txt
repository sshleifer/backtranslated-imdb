I got this movie on AZN by cable. It looks like it's a good movie, a Japanese green book. I can not say I never wanted an Asian film, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a great fan of John Woo's movies in Hong Kong. I'm not an opponent of a light-hearted movie like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like that. Well, I'd rather cut off my wrists and drink my own blood than see this and bad movie. I think director Steven Okazaki must have dipped the water with Quaalude, because no one had this personality. And when any of the DID characters try to act, unlike the mumbling of a line or two, their performance has surprisingly been forced and incredibly false. Honestly, I did not think anyone ever acted ... The only person who called the authentic one was Brenda Aoki. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I never laugh. Even more surprising is the fact that CBS morning news called it "a refreshing comedy breath". It was neither a refresher nor a comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think of such things. WATCH this movie unless you want to see a line full of boring stories and a wooden action. In fact, I think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better movie than this one ... and I came out half way through this movie!
