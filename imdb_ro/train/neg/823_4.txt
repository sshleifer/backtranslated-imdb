First, it takes about half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing his job. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman moves away to do his job for his masters, why lose about a third of the film on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story of the bow again does not go anywhere, simply proves that Hackman is under surveillance and everything he says or does is known by masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then he lost more time showing the meeting with his wife. All this should have lasted 10-15 minutes the most just as a set-up for real action, plotting and plotting the plot. Until the real action started, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great, as usual, and the other actors also, but this is a first-magnitude trumpet.
