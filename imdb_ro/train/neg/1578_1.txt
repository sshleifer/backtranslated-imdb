Imagine, say, 12-1am - home, bored, not tired. This scenario took place, say, about 4 years ago ... We started the TV and moved a few channels and found that this movie was activated. Oh WORD, this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A stray car that can not be stopped (because the brakes have been cut or something like that) that can do it on the highway - what will happen? This movie was so bad, actually amusing - I think stunts cost about $ 2 to make, there was an example of a child / baby being worn from the car with a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - the bridge is coming in front ... THIS IS THE BEST OF THE FINE OF A FILM - shows the child is missing on the bridge, but it seems so bad - you can almost see the look of the manikin they used - the classic low budget! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was GREAT I doubt they will show this movie again, so I'm glad I have to see this piece of garbage!
