** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is an intelligent brain surgeon who, along with Virginia Leith's wife, is involved in the car-free car accident ever. Leith is beheaded and the doctor gives his noggin cut back to his mansion and rejuvenates his head in his lab. The exterior of the mansion was shot at Lyndhurst's estate in Tarrytown; Laboratory scenes were apparently shot in the basement of someone. The bandage head is kept alive on "lab equipment" that is almost cheap to Ed Wood. Some of the library music - the highest point of the movie - appeared later in Andy Milligan, "The Body BENEATH". Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical speeches with another of Ever's errors, a mutant chained into the closet. Meanwhile, the good dock stretches over joints in search of a body worthy of his wife's noisy noodle. The end, in smooth prints, shows a sprinkling and dismemberment before the monster with the zucchini rises from the closet to bring the film to a close encounter. This took three years to be released, and audiences gave him the bad reception he had richly deserved. Among that, Plan 9 in the outer space and some others, 1959, should have been declared the Year of Turkey.
