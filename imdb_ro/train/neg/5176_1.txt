When a film is independent and not rated, like Hamiltons, I expected to stop talking about the norm, cut off the violence in my heart. I know good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, visited the site, and even convinced some friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this terrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I expect horror, not the Creek Dawsons with incestuous subtleties. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet few film expectations were shot in hell when I saw it was an hour before I saw the first drop of blood that came out of one's finger. There were too many holes of plot and they left too much imagination. I'm sorry to see Happy Feet. I think there would have been more violence and gore in the movie than Hamiltons!
