Oh dear, dear. I started to look at it without knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I was seeing. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I liked how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to blow the air into a single man who is unarmed and is expected to capture and escape with a rocket package. If it were so easy. I found a movie worse than "Plan 9 in outer space".
