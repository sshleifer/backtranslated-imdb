Unfortunately, the film is more concerned about making a social commentary blade at a real event, but it does not have balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I think Ben Coccio is a passionate player), or how the media and music are completely irrelevant is the obvious message (we even get to a ridiculous scene of the two boys burning ALL their CDs, talks about subtlety!), But the movie moves away just because it's "fiction." Good try. Yes, a great idea to relieve influential environments, but how do we know that the children who planned and executed a shooting school were not influenced by the media? or video games? We do not do it, and we will not take up this film because, again, these children are intelligent enough to give up the media completely, but bad enough to throw a Nazi symbol on the ground? haha I somehow do not believe this. The film bore you over, with the normal portrayal of families, almost to do a service to believe that there was not a serious defect in the family dynamics of the children who actually left and shot their colleagues. Why everyone is so preoccupied with making the murderers look "normal," when I'm not so obvious? A totally false and false image.
