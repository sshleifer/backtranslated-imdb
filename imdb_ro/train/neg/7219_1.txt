It is still difficult to understand that a movie as bad as this could be done in Hollywood. Action and story are simply pathetic and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this trash, except the director had nothing to do. I took ten minutes to realize that I wasted thirty rupees. I was filled with fear of losing more of my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know in which category it comes in. Please avoid this movie at any price, do something, even beat your head against the walls, but do not go to this movie.
