I have to say that many people have argued that some of us need time for the new "Dukes" to be a modernized version. OH TE ROG. If this is what you consider to be modernized, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN website also said (and quote): "Old phogs have to go over that and except it is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm far from being FOGIE MORE, and I will not overcome it, it was a DISTRACTION FOR ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing I had in the film was "HAZZARD". It was all the profanation, smoking and drinking really needed. The tower was terrible. Jessica attended several morning shows to discuss the movie, and I honestly think she's just got it. She is not in a way Daisy Duke, maybe a fluke, but certainly no duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not Bo. It should have included the original cast as at least a cameo, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve the scenario. I mean, even today's actors come to the people and the actresses express a negative opinion, so why some of you give positive remarks.
