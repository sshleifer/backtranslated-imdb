Gung Ho was a good idea, yet it is much to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of US jobs and foreign competition. In this film, lead character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company to come to America and help Pennslyvania dying. Two things come to you. First of all, why would a Japanese company come to America to do cars when they do so well? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds are heading to third world nations to make their products get rid of US labor costs? This makes the premise of the film that the world's number one producer would go to one of its "top competitors" (apart from Germany) and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy way this time. But he gives credible performance just as he could prove he could go from comedy to drama in just a few seconds and still not embarrassed, but director Ron Howard can not keep this from becoming a television movie, who arrives anyway, because the unexpected story must give a happy ending to end the policy and problems of the Japanese and American relations that do not oppose. Gung Ho has a happy day, and Laverne and Shirley feel like the producers of both TV shows making the movie and then making the TV version of this movie, which gives the movie "light feel". The Japanese manager gets to love the American Workers and feels like he and other Japanese people can learn from the Americans. Sais No.2 Man Saito, who supposedly does not like Americans all that I do not really believe in. I would have liked all the Japanese characters to be Saito than soft goofball the characters they made to the Japanese. It would make the movie more interesting.
