This is a very gentle and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant pieces. I can only guess that the intention was to make the game as accessible and intelligible as possible to an audience that was not exposed before Shakespeare. Doing this, however - making each line clear and obvious - the life of life has turned out and turned it into a flat caricature. Somehow, it's actually boring - a very difficult girl given by such wonderful material. The actor is best forgotten - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, are not so good. April The Shawnham hero is an open air vent, which frequently causes the victims. Jerry Mayer, Don John, is a nonsensical cartoon character at Snidely Whiplash (though Snidley was much more enjoyable). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) It's not in this version if it was not disguised and his name was removed from the credits. Since Joseph Papp is practically a theater god, this production is not only disappointing, but also scratching his head. Do not bother with this. Look at Branagh's Much Ado instead - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to say anything of great performance.
