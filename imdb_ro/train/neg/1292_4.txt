Okay ... it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard a lot of good things about it and I was very disappointed. We could see where the filmmakers came from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not very different from one another, that individuals were lost in battles, etc. (well, that's my presumption anyway = ^ _ ^ =) Anyway .. the movie bored me. I watched a lot of really long movies, but that seemed to shoot him and shoot him, because I could not take care of any of the characters. I just thought .. who cares ??? I also realized that it is acting to be quite dead and tense dialogue. I understand it was about the 1800s and everyone, but most conversations seemed pretty unnatural. Nobody seemed to have emotions along most of the film, except melodramatic events. "The story" does not seem to be supported by anything but "I'm a guy and you're a girl," which I do not think too much of a love story, and yet I felt I was headed for the belief that these people were in love . Well ... I think it's all "all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to" type of work, or whatever. We also hoped a kind of dynamism among the best friends (who initially seemed to have an interest in the girl), but that was just a drop. Can avoid the triangle of love cliche. I do not know. Well .. Daniel Holt was about the only character I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I did not like Jake exactly, but it looked a bit too ... without the back, I think. Jack Bull I did not care. And I'm pretty sure you have to hate everybody else, except the ordinary poor people who just left and right. It was pretty graphic and it had everything "Horrors of War" down, but I have seen a lot of other movies on the same theme done better. (I liked the Patriot very much, for example, even if it was emotionally manipulative) But, as I have already said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
