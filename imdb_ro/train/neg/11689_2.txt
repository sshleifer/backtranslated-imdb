I have never seen Spike Lee's previous films, because their trailers have never attracted my interest. I have seen and admire Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work and have some DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this film. If this movie is any indication of Spike Lee's ability to be a director, my advice would be to "get a job" and not waste the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators have watched the same movie I've seen. I can only assume, from their lovelorn sappy comments, that their adoration to Spike Lee has blinded them with the banality of this work. I paid only $ 2.50 in a second run, and I still felt like I wasted my money. IMDb "Trivia" page tells everything ........ "Shot in 39 days" - How can you expect to film a big budget "Blockbuster", as promised the mass- media, in such a short time? No wonder it was such a poor performance by all. "" Ron Howard was the first to direct the movie ... "- He probably made this project right, having more time to do, of course. Although the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. /> OK, maybe not, I'm sorry, this movie was so full of cliché cliché, implausible scenes and muddy characters that maybe it could not have made much of it. thank you to Russell ... Hello!) Jodie Foster filmed her role in three weeks. "And she showed herself, her representation of a" Fixer, "which made people's problems go away, was as incredible as the scenario he was given in. Does he really want to be there? Other Peeves: How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniform police officer that they are inside robbing the bank and should keep away ... otherwise? <br /> <br /> When Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) enters the bench to check if there are still corpses, many bank robbers, unarmed, would be "led" a policeman less "left" a policeman) to return to the front door, allowing police to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed he gave the thief "all the motives to shoot me." So, in their short struggle, did not even try to expose her face to the robbery? Maybe he received the answer he was looking for ... a thief would only be shot to prevent further identification. And why did Steve, Stevie, Steve-O (the accomplice of the thief) take so much to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not typical bank robberies. They had a different agenda and they did not want anyone to hurt. But the cops had no reason to believe they would not. For them it was a desperate situation. Why, when two of the wicked went out to "pick up pizza," they were not taken down. (first, how many robbers would have gone out without using a hostage as a shield? Is this version of Spike Lee from NY City or SNL?). Removing them would have reduced the numbers of the wicked, would have deceived their plans, and the remaining robbers would have given up. If not, at least there would be less bad boys inside. (Give SWAT something to do or send them home!) * Which police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to roll right in the bank and talk about a thieves thing that would not reveal them anymore first? He had no authority or government credentials; and, in addition, it was after all "already" a hostage situation ... add one more? Why did the CEO of the bank (Christopher Plummer) not destroy the incriminating documents? a long time ago? Sentimental screw! Diamonds, he could have sold. Who was that "schmuck" (the character, not the actor), with Jersey's accent, which, conveniently, volunteered and said he knew he was "100% Albanian," but he could not speak. .... SIR! PLEASE HELP YOU! And his ex-wife! What was a "schlump" she was! Both were completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * When questioning suspects, why did Det. Frazier, are I constantly harassing those who obviously were not part of the heist? (I mean - telling the elderly woman she could go and then she could not, then she could, then she could not) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put their suites in the jump, could not deduce that their escape plan had come out of the bank claiming they were some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Near the end of the film, it was shown that a fake wall was built in the powerhouse behind which Clive Owens hid "a week" ... where did the materials come from? (drywall and gypsum board). It was also supposed that they cut into the sewage so they could get rid of it. Bank employees have not complained of smell, all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a disaster; since the documents had "entered" into the hands of the thief, what kind of "references" was Mrs. White waiting to get from the CEO of the bank, seeing that now she should have been a target for blackmail because of her failure ? > <br /> * And last, but not least, What's the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? HOW MUCH! Should he have indicated his "decision" to bring these guys to justice? He looks more like a man jumping into a shopping cart, trying to prevent an intestinal movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than the mediocre plot; bad scenario; bad action; and the general pitiful direction ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> We hope that this will provide a good insight into the movie to help others decide if they will lose their money or not!
