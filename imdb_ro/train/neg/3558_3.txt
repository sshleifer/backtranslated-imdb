Based on Ray Russell's darkest bestseller, John's bust (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) has little to do with it. <br /> <br /> The "Incubator" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm in the vagina during sexual intercourse - or more specifically, rape. John Cassavetes, illuminated by his career as a successful director, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of bizarre attacks on young women. The horrific possibilities of the victims reproducing demonic offspring are not considered - nor is the public's tolerance for slow-moving garbage. The reluctance of the scenario to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies major issues with this Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose vaginal exercise.
