I was just disappointed with this movie because it was fake and the characters were not strong enough to take the movies to a rather low-pitched attempt. The basic idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not able to excite, really scare me or shock me - there was a part of the whole movie that I thought was terrible, but even that did not redeem it. I got to like Kate's character until the end of the movie, as it seemed to soften and become a bit more realistic to the end, the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for this film and I think the director / the writer was taken with countless characters used for purposeless purposes if he left it to the core characters by making him more of a solitary effort on Kate's part, maybe it would have worked - Jeremy's act was at least wood and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad chemistry on the screen - or lacking it. Such a shame. Disappointing.
