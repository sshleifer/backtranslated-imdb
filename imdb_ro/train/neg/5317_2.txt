For the first 20 minutes or so (I saw it on a PS2 so I have no idea how much it took it) Alienator sets up an exciting concern. I do not think I saw a flying movie with a stranger from another planet, like baddie before. However, interest soon turns into an astonished distrust, as you understand that the "alien" is a huge bodybuilder in a steel bikini. Yes, Alienator is obviously ridiculous. You do not think you're against it. In the world of shlock-horror, obviously ridiculous can often be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of his premises is that the whole movie really goes for him. The Alienator is funny as hell, but it's also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. The actors gathered on unsuccessful attempts, potential lines of pure dialogue dialogue genius are prevented by unpleasant incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent sets. Until the movie is over, you barely see the original concept through the total haystack of the game that the team has loaded. Add to this that the "Alien" just kills people by vaporizing them, as opposed to doing any "slashing" as such and you have a huge bunch of beatings of good ideas being left to rot. You'll laugh at Alienator, but AT, not with her. If this is your business, go ahead and check it out.
