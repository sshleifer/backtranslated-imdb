I remember that Richard Burton's character looked so hopelessly, and then remembered how his motivations had not been translated to me. In short, I remember the "Circle of the Two" because it was so phenomenally awful.

Remember "Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke shields), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other movies that just seemed to refer to adolescents who had sex, especially in adults . As a teenager during this period, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 1970s and 1980s, for a subconscious environment of restlessness in which to realize everything, so to speak.

No one would want this garbage ever to have surface to be distributed again publicly.
