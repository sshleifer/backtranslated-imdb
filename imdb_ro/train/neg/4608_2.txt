I bought this DVD because it has curry in it and the mpaa rating said; Rated R for Strong Violence and Sexuality, Nudity and Language ", which the IMO should say correctly;" Rated R for Strong Violence, Sexuality, Nudity, and Language. "The word" sexuality "should come after a "comma", not "and" because of the huge difference in significance. I think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the parts of sexuality and nudity ALWAYS are nonexistent my first impression when I look the mpaa rating was that I was going to watch something like "live", so I felt cheated, tell her it was so, so after all, who cares about the story if Kari was I know they do not do that, of course, that's just my opinion
