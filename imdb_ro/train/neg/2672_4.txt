I can not say that all of them have experienced in the Mundae movies that have seen only one hand, but it is obvious that this was done on a shoestring, and while it could have been respectable that the producers were able to do a Tomb Raider rip - inside a garage, is not because it's completely obvious that they did. The film is only forty-five minutes, and this is certainly a good thing, because there is not enough plot here to stretch it. It has something to do with a bad Nazi scientist (which seems to be just as bad as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever), a mummy that is clearly a man wrapped in the toilet and Misty - This version of Tomb Raider's movie, which keeps its tip for much less time than Angelina Jolie made in the big budget version. I have to say that, despite its shortcomings, this movie could have been better. Has Misty Mundae for a start, and even better than if you ask me is that she also plays even hotter Darian Caine. The pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema movie and this is detrimental to the non-existent plot, though this is not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a garbage film - but the fact that it is short is credit and if you are after a kind of lesbian sex, you could do worse.
