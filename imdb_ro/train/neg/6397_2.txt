This is a problem I have with movies that come on television, when there's nothing more to be watched. Somehow sucks in very bad movies. But it was pretty much watched. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after a comet, after which I find zombies around, makes me laugh. And that's why we gave a movie to 2, instead of 1. The story was bad ... but this makes you laugh (too stupid> funny). I think I just looked at him because the Star Trek guy was the leader. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and anyway he was the only funny character.
