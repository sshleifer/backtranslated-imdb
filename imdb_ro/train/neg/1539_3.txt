I'm a great fan of the West, but that ... anyway, what a shit! I think what stopped me close to bats was the unprecedented dialogue. I think I could write a better dialogue than when I was in the eighth grade. And the poor actors! In view of this terrible dialogue, none of them came to see anything but ridiculous. Indeed, I do not joke. Some of them are a little better than what you get in a Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "great" star in this movie, which, if you called him B-West, you would have praised him. This is what should probably be called B-minus Western. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other important talents. For him to appear in a vehicle, this poor man should have been something he has been trying to make up for the rest of his life. An annoying thing about this movie is that all men look like they have not laughed for a week and their faces are all fat. I know the old West guys were not always well-groomed, but for a man this movie is a movie that makes you want to go "EWWWW!" Indeed, this is a dreadful West. Denver Pyle also had to live down, especially after appearances in so many Westerns. Bad, bad movie.
