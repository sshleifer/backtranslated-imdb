Terrible acts by Potter and a flat plot, without any tension ever. And in terms of feminist polemic, it's ridiculous. I saw this trash when it was launched for the first time, and although I realized it was impatient beyond faith, I'm glad I went to see it. That's because I now have an immediate answer to the question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" In addition, I have the comfort of knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than the Tango Lesson. But I have to admit I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a script that would bring the maximum number of scholarships for the Arts Council around the world (as shown in the closing credits). has recently seen Orlando and can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons of making that film. All he had to do was a bunch of cloaked suits, a few glimpses of the camera by the leading lady, and a poor plot to seduce the cinema that became public. So why should not he think he could get rid of the self-indulgence that is the Tango Lesson?
