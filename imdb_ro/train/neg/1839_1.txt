I could not wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after we started it, we could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. I actually watched the whole movie. My wife and I have been waiting and I've been waiting for something fun to happen, but nothing funny happens. The box reads it would be very funny. The premise of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie miss you? Well ... do not miss it! This is the most unpleasant "comedy" I've ever seen. Nobody we talked about was a little funny. It's just a very lame film. Trust me. Avoid it ... WARNING!
