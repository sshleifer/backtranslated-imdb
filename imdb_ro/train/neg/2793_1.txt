This is up there on my top list of the worst movies I've ever seen on Starz on Demand. They seem to take every right to a carp-fest I find and I can put it here. Why? Who knows! It seems that anyone with a digital camera and an invested budget can come up with a horror movie and put it on television. To be honest, this has been terrible since I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. I always try to have an open mind about low budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are films that have worked around their low budget, or in other cases they have asked for the budget to be great. This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You know the plot so far, I'm sure if you read this. Whether you've heard about it on Starz on Demand, or for whatever reason you've come to this page from boredom. This is a pathetic and whine girl we know for all three minutes in an incredibly bad music video of "heavy metal". Anyone who put it together must have thought it would seem very interesting, but indeed, really not. Anyway, kill. Then he possesses somebody. Then I start some killing. It's really great and as completely mediocre and boring as possible. When the first weapon fire goes out in her apartment, it sounds pretty serious like a popcorn popping piece. Was it the best sound effect they could come up with? We could find a better sound to use free (without copyright), on the internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Do not leave the other reviews claiming this is a 10-star movie that tricks you. They are obviously either the distributors of the movie or even the director who tries to convince you that this piece of junk is worth buying. Laughable.
