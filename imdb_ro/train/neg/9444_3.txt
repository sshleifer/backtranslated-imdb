There's only one thing I'll say about the cat in the hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie he's drinking ... I've lost behind every terrible banter in the movie that not only sucks, t baby is right. Oh, and the way the cat was talking about the hat was annoying ... about the plot that I completely forgot. Who cares is sucked anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined, but I think the writers try to make her sound like he in the Austin powers without talking about the swinger and did too much - but that was annoying. you do not see it - it's at the bottom 100 .............................. jokes are so untrue that it's fun
