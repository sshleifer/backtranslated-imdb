For the minority minor here, praising this SERIOUS GIRL movie. I know it's about people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but whoever has more than a few brain cells can surely see that this is a total garbage. It's so bad that you do not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume those who say how wonderful friends are with someone involved in the film and are trying to make a career. Salvation in all respects, do not convince people by saying otherwise. The story is a poor rebalancing of previous records, the scenario is the same. Attempts to conceal the lack of originality through the use of a girl (WOW!) Do not hide the lack of filming ideas and unfortunately there is a total lack of any scarecrow. Absolutely without redeeming qualities. I gave this pair of chancers a note, simply, because someone had someone to make someone finance this piece of nonsense. They probably did more effort than they did to make the movie. Shame.
