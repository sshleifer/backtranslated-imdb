No wonder this was released directly on DVD here in Australia, no redemption contains what ever was. The dialogue was hokey, acting, terrible and sucking scenario! Anyone thinks it would be a good idea to make a follow up or follow up to the John John Wargames movie, the 80s, well it must be something because it was a bad idea! Amanda Walsh was good in her as candy eye / love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other lead lead - that's about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code for Everyone, Check Hackers or Original Wargames - both are better than this piece of nonsense!
