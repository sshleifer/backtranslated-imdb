Good Earth is not a wonderful movie by any means, it's a normal way. Perhaps it was different in the 1930s, but who would like to see the life of a farmer. It's not very interesting for me. Yeah, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni are doing a great job, but the movie has taken too long. I could have told you the end of this movie through the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, proves just like him. Both fall in love with their wives, just as they are in their deathbeds. The film makes a 360-degree crossover from one generation to the next. Also, this movie did not have good character actors or funny moments, it was simply depressing stuff about sustaining as a farmer during a crisis period.
