... and how they carried you out of your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films of the '70s, made without actors from nowhere, an embarrassing scenario, terrible direction and a relentless desire to combine "horror" with light comedy. This film introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur under Lake Crater ... a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the clay variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants around Lake Crater. The whole thing is taken care of by Steve, our local sheriff. Much of the movie - when we do not show the blood pools left behind from what we thought should have been feces - is spent by the antics of annoying two guys, called Arnie and Mitch, who lead a boating place. They try so badly to be funny, we have some similar lines, looking at a business sign, Mitch telling Arnie: "You wrote the wrong bait, it's written B-A-T-E." The ladies were pretty limited here. Then we see how he gets drunk together and imagines a tree trunk as the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy be careful! Dinosaur seems fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And, at least, the lake is beautiful.
