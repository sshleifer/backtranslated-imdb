SPOILERS WHEN !!!!! I read the book "First to the Death" and I wanted to see if the movie followed the book, so I followed it. For the most part he did. There have been some MINOR differences (the location of the last violent scene, for example), but not many and for the most part the film remained true to the book, more than most films. This may be a mistake - although the film was perfectly cast - especially with Pollen and Bellows - I was not impressed by the book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned and, in the end, was completely dissatisfied and felt almost embarrassed. There is no difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payment" in the book or in the movie. I rarely read the thriller who created such a twist with the final resolution and hoped the film would vary a little. The whole - (did it, did NOT do it, they did NOT) - was not interesting, not fascinating and confusing, annoying and depressing than anything else. Add to this that the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end (after her disease is cleansed and she cries at his grave) .. and then cut to the place where she thinks of suicide ... then suddenly, a fight for her life with the nasty REAL who was released after being arrested .. but it seems he and his wife were in it together .... HELLO !!! This has now become the "GENERAL SPIRIT" instead of a good old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and stolen from the book and watching the movie (I must admit that she kept my wonderful attention - the act was very good for a TV movie) hoped she would not follow the book she did to do it. /> <br /> I still think the movie can be traced and for some reason it does not leave such a bad taste in the mouth as the book (or maybe I just know what would happen) But I have to say how which story was unveiled was not done at all.
