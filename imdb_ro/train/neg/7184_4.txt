This was not a very good movie. There were a lot of unlikely and predictable things that happened during the movie ... but I think most commentators do not know the reason why this movie should enjoy a wide audience. This movie was produced by John Magnon! Is not it enough to inspire everyone to check this movie? A movie produced by a former NBA star does not come every day, you know. Pretty stupid children in a big house that was cut by an ax with a psycho. Every clich√© trampled us so we could stoop. Teen sex. And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen use of drugs! College hijinx! And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
