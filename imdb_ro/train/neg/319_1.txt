A friend of mine bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then he was extremely cherished. Despite big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton, and Burt Young incredibly talented, this movie was as fun as taking a chin and banging it straight through the hole in the ear. He uses comic techniques of fatigue, the bottom of the barrel comedy technique - he constantly breaks the fourth wall, as Sandler speaks to the audience, and the seemingly unnecessary assemblies of "hot girls." Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship that wants to make her a successful comedian to be successful with women. When the resident's comic - "Dickie" shamelessly named because of his unprecedented success with the opposite sex - is supposed to be lost at sea, Sandler's character pauses. Dickie is not dead, is rather stuck in the bathroom, probably sick of the sea. Maybe from his mouth he shed the worst film of all time.
