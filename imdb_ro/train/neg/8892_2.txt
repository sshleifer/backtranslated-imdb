I have to admit, this version disappoints Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except the assistance that was my favor! Juliet had good abilities as a teenager, but she can not give emotional depth to her lines and we can not connect with her. It's worse to make the scene when she thinks of drinking sleeping poise ... Oh, my God, do not cry anymore! I would have poured it in my mouth to shut it down! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! In view of his other films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), it's pretty shocking in this movie. And do not take Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It is still good to see if you are looking to see each Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of the film. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and the current Leo and Clare!
