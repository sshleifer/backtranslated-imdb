This was released on the Alpha DVD market, and it is for the likes of Boris Karloff fans (like the MOI) only. It is not a horror film, but a drama where Boris is a scientist fighting to agree to kill a rich woman's husband in order to earn the fortune necessary to continue with his work. But once the victim dies, he changes his will and leaves his husband nothing, all unleashes. <br /> <br /> It is sufficient imitation seeing Karloff as another type of selfish sinister, and some of which act unintentionally hilarious (especially from the leader of Mrs. Mona Goya, who is absolutely a laughing revolt as a wife double-cross). <br /> <br /> But do it with caution.
