I saw this movie twice through a Pentecostal church that my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, then again when I was eight my brother 6. This the film terrified my brother and I and modeled the way I looked at the world with distrust. It was not just the movie but the philosophy that attracts so many "Christians" about the "beast's sign" and about kidnapping. This film, the church, and volatile negligent education have led to severe paranoia towards the future. For years, I have lived under the delusional influences of the church and the fear of forgetting Christ. I'm 40 years old now. I've been through years of counseling. Once I told a psychiatrist this film and the church and family faith system. I was coupled with a delusional disorder. In fact, I began to believe this, my brother reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I am no longer afraid of the future, I am confronted with the fear inherent in its members by the church. I took this experience to accomplish my goal, close to my licensing as a psychologist specialized in childhood trauma.
