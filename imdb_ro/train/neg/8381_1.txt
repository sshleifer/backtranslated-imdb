There are also extremely talented black directors, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel, and a lot of others who bring credit to the cinema industry. Then there are the Wayans Brothers who at one point (15 years ago) had a very entertaining television show "In Living Color," which launched Jim Carrey's career among others. Now we have stupidity that replaces humor and noise swelling as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those in Little Man who could not be. A child with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as only a few months old? The baby comes with a shadow of five that she shakes. It is reported that the baby is having sex with his foster mother behind her husbands, Darryl, back. Yes, yes, that's just hilarious. As a criminal, the "little man" is the most stupid on the planet. She masters a stolen rock that is immense in a woman's bag and she has to follow her. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I am surrounded by monsters". Based without credit on a cartoon Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is too bad to be fun even by far. An indication of how bad this movie is, Damon Wayans, who appeared on Jay Leno last night before the BAT Awards and has not even mentioned this terrible movie. When Hollywood stops Green's garbage from Brothers Wayans. When they overcome their white guilt with all probability.
