Despite or partly because of the intelligent use of music to emphasize the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters, the stereotypes are inward, and the verosimilitude and characterization are found in this kinematic sieve, which is not too subtle. One has the sense that John Singleton was embarrassed in post-structuralist literary theory, because it was the flavor of the day, and "Higher Learning" was a tendentious result. The low point of the movie is a "peace" rally, in which the free movement symbols of the 1960s are reappropriated for what looks much more like a Take Take The Night rally with live musical acts with strictly tattoo identity. Perhaps in his revisionism the director was trying to assert that the identity policy is the new Vietnam? Ooh, as Adrienne Rich of him and Remy's dragging in the crowd is a nice touch if you're in a sort of political posture for Rich. I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists have brought into the folk culture the academic trinity of race, class, and gender, and said they hate people "a viable and honorable political option." Where is Camille Paglia when you need her?
