I saw "Descent" last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a great disappointment. The disappointment because the story was potentially strong, that the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate film was interesting and being a fan (perverse sounds, I'm not!) From the rape / vengeance rage of the 70s, I did not have I need to say very curious to check this movie. My conclusion: to stay in classics! Yes, the story has potential, but dialogues are flat, unconvincing actors. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say it is a fair description of the college world in the US, that the nakedness of the characters serves a purpose and everything that jazz does, but makes the whole movie insignificant. Just like the scene in which Dawson is raped: he does not have a high intensity! I did not expect something "irreversible", but we still do not think it would be a compassion for her? I did not. Not for a minute, it was so dazzling ;-) And I read that the photo was impressive. Well, it's really good, but no break point. I have to admit that the festival prize was not so good that maybe I lost something here, but at the end of the movie I could not think, "I feel like I've once again seen Argento's" Inferno ". laugh out Loud More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and we all have the bitter feeling of watching a longer and boring version of the scene in the dirty bar near the American-Canadian border in Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Eu ' ... the red and bluish blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the lazy / decadent general atmosphere ... No, I could not get into this movie.
