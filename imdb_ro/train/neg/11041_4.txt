The show is medium. Do not make me laugh especially. However, I think Courtney really reduces it. It does not seem natural. He has these three ways to talk, all robotic. He speaks quietly (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or does the thing in which he starts to speak normally and begins to cry out gradually. However, her cry is "suppose I'm crying, because I should not be too loud on the stage." <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny. It's annoying. You can not get her personality, because she does not make emotions and she is not upset. She has a husband who does all these things stupid and there is no reaction on her part. Very dry and simple action.
