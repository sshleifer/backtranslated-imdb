This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. What a splendid bowl loss. That's James Cromwell as the ignorant, acting as a deputy. I could go further, but obviously I will spend more time on this review than anyone ever did the script. The only thing about this movie is that we share it and how to entertain ourselves in profane harassment beyond the reasonableness of a reasonable person. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
