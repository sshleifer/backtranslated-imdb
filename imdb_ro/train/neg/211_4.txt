The obvious love of a high school bunch (I think), who enjoys non-stop hip-hop, breaks dance, graffiti and tries to become a DJ at Roxy - or something like that. To be completely honest I was so bored that I forgot! Even those who love music agree that this film is very attentive and - like a drama - did not succeed in a dismal way. We should find these nice and cute children. We found them few and boring. The one I really hated was Ramon. He makes graffiti on subway trains and this is just as great. Excuse me? He defames his public property, which he does not have to start with. Also, these "great" children enter the city's electricity to organize a dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh. So we should find a bunch of fun laws full of love and fun. I could forgive all this if the music was good, but I can not stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and were non-stop! Always play! It has reached the point where I quickly promoted my numerous endless music numbers. (Cut the music and try a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are some imaginative numbers - the underground dance fight, a really funny number of Santa and the Roxy climate show. If you like hip hop here is your movie. But look for a good mixed drama - forget it. Also, how did you get this PG rating? There's an incredible amount of oath in it.
