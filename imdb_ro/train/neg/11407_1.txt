This film is a perfect example of an excellent book that was destroyed by a movie. Jacob's boyfriend is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There's no story, parcels are gone, and editing is awful. At first, music is directly from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly terrible. Bridget Fonda's act is decent, but whoever acts is absolutely amateur. I would suggest this film someone studying to be a producer as a study of how not to produce a movie because it is full of bad scenes, transitions and actions that should have been re-shot! Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
