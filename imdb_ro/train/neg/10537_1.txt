Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation? There are some amazing actors in this movie (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they clearly see the money. Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in two other episodes of Cartland - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who seems to be badly embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. If you really want to see a cartoon adaptation, Bonham Carter is the one to go ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what title!). Gilbert is the weak link in this, but Bonham Carter is well-liked and of course even acting, and the rest of the cast plays it with a firm cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)
