Hawked like the hottest movie that was ready to offend anyone - Guess what? It worked, I'm offended for making money to rent this. Two friends and I got bored and we decided to see if the truth about the movie I saw on TV was true. The Curse of Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed us on this trash! It was the worst movie I've ever seen from Hollow Man. I generally avoid the miserable, but I suck on that. I've been knocking down the stick that suggests that I have rented it, and its movie privileges have been revoked. There is nothing amusing to distract from this movie ... even the "Dickman adventures" script was the best at a sophisticated level. My color p *** ed. He thought the value of production was stupid for an important reason ... no ... just been sucked. NEVER CUT THIS! for any reason. Not even with abundant amounts of illegal substances would be this funny movie. That says ALOT. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you value your health - never see this movie. There are many things - stupid, useless and worthless to name a few. But the main thing he was watching was: weird, funny - he did not fail. Crash and burn ....
