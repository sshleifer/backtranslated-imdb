Mary Pickford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after her father's death and then has a love story. As Leopard Snowman said, the movie is pretty episodic to get started. Some of them are funny, like Pickford whipping her clans at the church, while part of it is just there. Overall, the story is weak, especially the Romanian plot of controversial recycling and controversy and its climax. The transfer is so dark that it's hard to appreciate the landscape, but even for that, it does not seem to be the best film of director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once again in a somewhat more accessible "Little Little Rich Girl," pocketing Pickford as a child character.
