Poor, damn, MooCow will really recognize the truth: I'd like this cheap parody, cheese. The idea that a lot of horde of killer tomatoes destroys the US is a great idea and, in spite of themselves, the moovie offers some decent tricks, tremendously the terrifying terrific looks that run out of large tombs, obviously false. This movie, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts by spoofs, which became so popular in the 1980s and '90s, thanks largely to Airplane Airplanes! This, like spoofs, is quite poor. Many humorous attempts are wrong failures and will cause many jams. But thanks to the coveted tomatoes, the inappropriate song of "Puberty Love" and the accidental scene of the helicopter, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" offer some goods, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There are many wrong things with this movie ... and so it's just right, it's hard to explain. Enough people must have enjoyed the fact that tomatoes have returned to two Moore movies and a series of cartoons! The big pieces of time spent away from tomatoes are pretty boring. And you shed your 70-year-old clothes, dude! ; = 8) This red is healthy and cheesy, but it deserves a chickot or two; MooCow says he's grabbing a pizza and pop in tomatoes! : ??
