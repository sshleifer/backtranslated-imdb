First there is nothing in this movie that really caught me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie in which I said "Well, it was not something special" after I saw it. Probably there was drama and stuff, but I just did not grab, but more semi-dull seam. As I said in the title, it looks very cheap in a way. The quality of the movie itself (the images) resembles a low quality and reminded me of some of the cheap films made for television films rather than a very well respected film. Angles and camera pictures were very amateur, in my opinion. They did not really have pictures or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I have not seen many movies in English and the ones I've seen did not really impress me more than that and were similar to the movie, colors and the like. "Game" tried to be cool, hip and smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" about it, if you want) but it did not even succeed for me. In general, just an indie film that was not something special (at best, I'm afraid) and practically, unfortunately, over two hours lost.
