He saw this movie in an early preview and I can not tell him how badly I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the audience was staring at Pacino's southern accent. Poor Al truly looked, really haggard, and I can not decide if he was deliberately part of his role as a drug-addict, or maybe he did not sleep before coming to the stage. Much worse than Pacino's close ones is, however, a miserable excuse for a plot. At the beginning of the movie we are told that Pacino's character is homosexual and I suspect that this was what the writer wanted first. Later, however, we must suspend our credulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both of them are sleepwalkers through blade roles) lust after this elderly man, half-dead, with a ridiculous accent. The worst part of the whole was the main plot of plot, which had to do with a certain corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never care. Because it was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of resuming and editing, but you can bet that I will not pay a penny to see it in theaters.
