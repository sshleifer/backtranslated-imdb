I'm going to register as the second person who, after years of using IMDb to search for films, was motivated by Nacho's The Abandoned movie to create an account and post a comment. This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was about not to exist, and none of the "puzzle pieces" had come together in any way. The act was ridiculous and the writing was embarrassing. As this film arrived and came to be complete, it is completely beyond me. The only rescue grace I could find was the victorious and repetitive use of Anastasia Hille of the word f. (And a brilliant sound design) If I had faced the option of seeing this movie again or being beaten by the wells wild, I would be against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed I can not give 0 stars.
