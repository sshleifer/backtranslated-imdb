honestly, if someone has a brain, there is nothing positive to say about this movie ever. <br /> <br /> I lost the $ 1 leased. I prefer to laugh at Will Smith saying, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must have been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * though you said that * was better than all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and you have something to say, IQ, to be extremely low, with such a bad taste in movies, hurts. Thank you ... and the truth, it was spoken! Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Get Rejects of Devil, now it's a classic.
