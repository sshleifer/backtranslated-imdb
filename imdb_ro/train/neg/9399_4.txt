Bill Boyd's Troika, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Coney Island flesh fighting for Ginger Rogers, a pit that sells taffy with salt water. With the outbreak of World War I, Threesome enrolled and followed Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe's production is hard going, with three male lead-cheeks up the landscape with burn-gaskets and the "lively" dialogue, which is growing fast tiring. The second half focuses on sequences of action as the US Navy pursues both a German cruiser and a U-boat. These sequences are lively and well-filmed, but in general this is a long and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat end. For fans just the stars.
