After watching the movie trailer in cinema, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it up in the competitive world of computer companies. The all-star show was another message that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not want to look at her in her first week of release, then it disappeared until week 2, I was afraid it was a bit of a miss. I patiently waited for the release of the DVD, then I bought her up home for a nice evening viewing. Anticipation on the way home was much better than the movie. To begin with, the direction is terrible. There is no thought in mind, and the director does just a role for himself, so he can appear in the movie. I would not hurry to hire him in the future. Second, the main role is entirely mistaken as Ryan Phillipe. Normally, Phillipe is the cool character, as in Cruel Intentions and the Arms Path, but in this case he should be a humble hero who tries to portray him slipping when running and having strange friends but he does not have justice. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani are not good enough, but when none of the performances are approaching the best. The only point of attraction of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been done for him and is his enchanting and mysterious way of shooting the film. The end point is that this movie is another film that fills the trailer with scenes you do not see in the movie, and instead only appears in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Which causes even more disappointment, though, although some of these scenes are gross, they do not cover major gaps in the story.
