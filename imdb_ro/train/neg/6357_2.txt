I'm so disappointed. This movie let me feel offended by my time and my mental energy. Here was the Chinese film Woody Allen again: the upper class neurotic manhattan who was debating whether or not they would deceive their husbands. Woody, I've already seen these characters, I've already seen ten times the story of you. Where did your creativity go ??? You have to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically from Annie Hall - and you have to change it with her. There are more exciting and funny scenarios where you can apply your brand of anger and neurosis - why not try them instead of rehashing the same old story over and over and over again. When I heard that Woody Allen has a new project, she does not do anything for me - because now I have come to wait for the old state of waiting: couples who teach one another and get to deceive. Depressing and the same old, same old. If Woody wants to win fans, then he has to understand that the sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not insulted.
