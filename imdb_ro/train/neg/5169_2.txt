WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. Although I did not see them all, Hamiltons offered a piece of fun that did not do it. I thought that, along with the semi-bad scenario, the stupid scenario, and the twist at the end of the movie, which was very late, this movie was sucked! Well, so the suspect are people who eat other people. We ...... Note I told people not people, not because they are not people, or wait I think I am, OH WAIT, YOU DO NOT WANT! !!! So are these cannibal people or are they embraced or what are they? I mean, maybe there are only "things" that came here to see what people taste or they are cannibals who ate because for a long time or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE! WHICH WAS! So, if you think the Hamilton are good, I wonder why, why, why, why, why, why was it so wonderful, because for me it was just flat out terrible! A great BOOOOOOO for Hamiltons! Go see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for a fun !!!!!
