This movie seemed to be better than it was. The cinema is good, the action seemed solid, the dialogue was not too rigid ... but after about twenty minutes, there is this long scene with a doctor you know that is actually a patient in the asylum claiming to be a doctor - and she it's just south of there. In addition, the demon is about the worst heat from Godzilla's appearance in the Curse of the Demon. There are also strange demon worshipers wearing masks that look like explosive adolescents at the start of the Logan round. Eventually, cinema could not save this movie. In spite of some pretty good performances of the actors, the story does not go anywhere. I think Hellbored would have been a better title for that.
