My life is about saving animals. I work voluntarily with a cat rescue organization. I'm vegetarian because I could not kill an animal, even sustain my life. I can not even kill a spider, I put it out. The scene in which children throw stones at the bird until they die, the sooner they participate in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, have hurt me and have been haunted since then. I simply agree that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. Conclusion - adopted adoptive parents earlier - does not redeem the image of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want the child to see this movie?
