This film refers to Eddy's story as mentioned in the title and to his return to the old friends of a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends he left the light that Eddy left him as a means of coping with the death of a friend he feels responsible for. But this is irrelevant because the choices made in production are extremely poor and are not fully realized. Scenarios do not always have to be "spoken", but they should at least help in writing the story. Here attempts of a line such as "he took off" or "know that you do not have love in the heart" only evokes something that deserves the time of the audience. Also, whenever the writer feels a loss in case of going to the next he cuts off to a music fit of the protagonist walking through the fields to some indie music mood. Talks hard about it. If you are interested in a good film, the type that gives quality and substance to style, then this is not the movie for you.
