My comments about this movie have been deleted twice, which I find quite offensive because they make an effort to judge this movie for others. Be tolerant of the opinion of others. Obviously, writing in the spirit of Nietzsche's works is not understood, so badly completely changes my comment. I think this is a very bad movie for many reasons. should be very careful in making a film about a philosopher who is not understood by the masses so far, and among colleagues he has passionate talks. One thing the philosophers like is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. Making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his "ideas", is one thing that should be extremely careful or preferably do not at all. Wisdom begins with knowing what you do not know. It may be thought that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film has no imaginary character, but the life of someone who lived and had a great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells of a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the subject, about tomatoes. There is a responsibility for producers when making a movie about real facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. Scenario: One of the first things I noticed were the ridiculous accents. Why? It distracts from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the truths he has found. It does not help putting things in a correct perspective or time! Come on, do good English or better; German language! Even Mel Gibson got that right part ... letting the characters speak some kind of aramic dizziness in passion. Secondly, it is well outdated. <br /> <br /> 3D, Assante is not an actor to describe Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are much farther. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
