Photos that usually glorify a hero make sense. For example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them, despite their bad deeds. Why? There were two people caught in the depression when people were desperate to survive. This film has no substance. The character Viggo Mortensen appears soon as a popular hero. Why? He moves along an Idaho highway on his way to the hospital where he took his wife. Nobody bothers to understand why he's trying to run away from everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes obvious that it is not a red-throated terrorist, nobody in the government wants to help him in trying to save his back. Jason Priestley collaborates as an emcee radio based on the story in support of our hero. The end is absolutely unbelievable.
