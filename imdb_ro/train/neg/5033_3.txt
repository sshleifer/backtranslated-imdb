Crimes happen in a desert town in Texas. Who is responsible? Some news of the mystery and racial tensions (the latter do not really fit), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (from FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 Infamy) plays the role of Brazilian quasi-detective teenager. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and gore, nudity and some languages.
