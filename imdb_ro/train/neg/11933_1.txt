My baby makes better videos than this! I feel destroyed by the $ 4.00 spent on this thing! There is no data on the apparently Wellspring video case; and, what's worse, there is no production date for the original movie anywhere in the movie! The only time is 2002, driving a tenant who does not think he has a recent movie. This movie was so bad in terms of overcoming and irrelevancy for any time, but exactly when it was done, I am amazed that someone would take the time and expense to sell it as a movie.

Regardless of your state of mind, while you follow it, I can tell you that it is not better after the first scene; So, knowing this, I'm sure you will be asleep long before the end.
