Why do people who do not know what they were in the past felt the need to try to define that moment for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and Apollo landing with Titanic sinking, and you have a realistic vision like this soap opera formulated entirely of scarce litter. Is that what the kids are too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who fail to do a grade school? "I will show those old days, I will take my own film and prove that you do not need to know someone about your subject, so you can make money." Yeah, we already know that. The only thing this movie made for me was to give me a small perspective on subclass thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run the other way round. It is abusive for children to let their parents raise their worthless children. It is the abuse of the public to simply wear Woodstock and moonlanding in a film as if ipso facto means the portrait film 1969.
