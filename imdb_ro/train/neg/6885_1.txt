... in an oadipal comedy, otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, which would have been oedipal. I was the only victim to a screening of 7:20 tonight (3 days after the movie was opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that those who followed have taken account of warnings. The blossom is out of Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin is not his fault; but rechash child's geek baby in another bad wig is simply not working. It would be another crime if this was the last appearance of Eli Wallach's screen. Diane Keaton will probably survive after taking this salary - mainly because so few will be seen in this, the worst vehicle he has chosen in the last few weeks. Tonight I sat you alone in the theater, lived (laughing, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude to offer the only three-dimensional character of the movie. He is indeed one of our best actors. In short, even the work of Jeff Daniels can not redeem this image.
