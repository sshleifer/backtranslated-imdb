This has to be the worst, and I mean the worst biker ever made! And that says a lot because the stinkers line is long and smelly! Now, at least we know what happened to Ginger after being rescued from Gilligan Island! A frightened young woman, Tina Louise (she was probably afraid of seeing this mess!) He is a blocked motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive bikes in the history of the movie. But, do not worry about your fans! Batman, I mean Adam West, as an emergency doctor, comes to rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this "bomb" are some cute women, some ridiculous battle scenes and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
