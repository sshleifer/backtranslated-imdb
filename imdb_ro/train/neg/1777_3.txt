If you are the type of film-goer who enjoys the original content and the intelligent suspense ... then look elsewhere, the kids Sleepwalkers cause is really sucks. Usually, I'm more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... it was bad. I love him especially when Charles gives Tanya a trip home, she refuses, and then she is seen in WALKING HOME. Where's his car? Anyway, you do not see him, folks. I really want to be more specific, but the words get away. Cats are jumping on people. A guy who's been stabbed by corn. Cheesey aligns the proverbial "wazoo." You just do not see her. Wait, take this back! See it for stage designer Stephen King as the guy who owns the cemetery. In fact, it's pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King offers the best performance of the film. But, other than ... wow ... BAD.
