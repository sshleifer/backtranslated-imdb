What begins like a gentle country, a harmless and easy-to-enjoy romantic tale is changing as Harlan, originally the charmer of Edward Norton, gradually reveals more about himself and things take a revolt for sinister, the film gradually changing from a romantic southern to a modern wilderness, a charming farmer (Norton) wanders in the city and excites a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), who apparently rescues her from a dead end existence with her bad father -temperated, with a wind story, but it is becoming increasingly obvious that there is more to this cowboy than to the eye. Edward Norton ?? a true chameleon actor (with the fitting facial hair change) who plays a chick, a slight upset, but maybe because he was just trying to act without worrying about the accent. He certainly makes it seem effortless to make all the tiny adjustments, as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes, we are never sure exactly where Harlan comes from, and what seemed to be a good performance from Norton is gradually getting confused. Evan Rachel Wood is full of love and has never really done much to do but to sneak at Norton. Down in the Valley strikes like a slightly uneven story, due to the change of pace, and never really making the protagonist's motives to clarify the public's sympathy for characters remains uncertain. Should we like this crazy or not? Even after a dramatic change in the events, it remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the film, as if the screenwriter could not figure out what kind of story they wanted to say and settled for a certain beat. If the movie had remained one or the other, it could have been a solid film, but, as we have left, it's a mess. Old-fashion romantic fans will enjoy part of the film but will be hit by the dark tone. Complete fans from Norton (or fans of the lush landscape of San Fernando Valley) give this a wish.
