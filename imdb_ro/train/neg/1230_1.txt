Words can not describe how bad this story is (and therefore this bad movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So there is a mall and its parking space is completely full. Basinger's character goes to buy a cup of tea and packing paper. When it comes out, the whole place is so empty that no one can hear two gunfire drawn near? Even if he lives there, when he moves away from evil, he goes to the furthest and most coveted place than in the nearest police station or at least in a crowded place? HAIDE !!! I will not even get into the infamous red instrument box, since other people have done this before. Not to mention the way he kills the mad bullies one by one. She's so stupid, without a little logic, I can only warn you that you look at her, it's a TOTAL of waste of time, honestly!
