this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie if it paid me. The so-called horror scenes in this scene have been incredibly predictable and have been played over the years. There was nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth $ 7.50 I paid to see it. You do not go see it, do not rent it, do not read about it online, because any of these things would be a complete loss of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a poor performance and she should be ashamed of herself for tricking her good name with this movie. Shame on you, Sarah, that you were associated with this terrible and horrible movie. Horrible movie, you do not have to ever see it.
