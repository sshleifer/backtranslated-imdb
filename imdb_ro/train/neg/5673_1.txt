I quote Oedipus Rex because it is a tragedy that this movie was made! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am by no means a Uwe Boll hater like most humorless people on IMDb! Uwe Boll films as postal rats and tunnel are hilarious evil and therefore entertainment. But honestly, this movie was horrible. I hated so much that I would give her a star rating if I could. The story is just the hell! She spends four-fifths of the movie that builds the plot, and then they have the middle which is just horrible, horrible, horrific scenes made with no taste! Finally ends with a "villan wins the end," which is totally acceptable, but it certainly could have tasted more than that! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier), nor are I against violent movies! I love the violent movies! I liked Saw movies, Tokyo Gore Police movies, The New York Ripper, the 28 films, The Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, The Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, Every Tarantino Movie, Every Sam Peckinpah Cannibal f ** king of the Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! Look at the movies I just listed! If I liked the Cannibal Holocaust, and that's not gonna be bad! Uwe, do not darken again! You're funny when you're in your heart, like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! I felt horrible all over after I saw that! DO NOT PRAY YOU !!! WARNING TO ALL COSTS !!!!!
