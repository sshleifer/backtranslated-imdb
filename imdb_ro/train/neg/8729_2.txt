This is a thriller with a good concept, good action, good photography and good intentions around all but that is confusing and disjointed in execution. Garcia plays the role of John Berlin, a forensic detective from LA who moved to a small town in California at the request of a friend of his on the force there. Soon he is involved in investigating an unsolved crime, which leads to his theorization of a serial killer in which no one else believes. The familiar victim is theorized to be pudgy, which leads to a love story with a blind girl - to be a witness - to a nearby school for the blind. Despite an interesting story, there were too many quantum phases, and holes were built in this movie where I woke up wondering, "How the hell did I make it?" Or "how did I find out? "I realized he was confused and dislocated, despite the good action, etc. John Malkovich has a small part in the end as an investigator FBI out to get Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
