After too many bad memories I went to jump this episode every time it appeared in Season 2. I just recently looked back just to remember why. I have always considered this the worst ST episode: TNG (except "Shades of Gray," which is barely an episode). I keep listening to the disc and thinking of the red-scripted scenario by author's writing author: "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" Since Deanna Troi's pronouncement and the constant reminders of all others about what a charming and dangerous kidnapper Okona is, Guinan's explanation of how funny the droid's joke is (not), who deals with solving the conflict, not there is not a point of plot that is not underlined and triple stressed for our edification, and there is no credible moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is a dog too doggy, which can be the center of plotting the plot. On the other hand, no one other than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") can pull from this role-enhancing substitute. (Zero points, by the way, to the data subplot.) While I think Joe Piscopo ceased to be funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had no reason to work here, though the little Jerry Lewis was funny in a a good day, you might think of this as a charming tribute to an episode of the smaller Original series. I would rather skip ahead to Time Squared or Q Who.
