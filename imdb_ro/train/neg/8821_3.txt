Why, why will they not learn? When you have a nice, lucky trick, use it! Do not rush to try to do everything deep and thoughtful; it will be just the hunt to look foolish. Bad Christmas is the story of Harry Stadling, who has seen a little too much of his mother kissing (father-dressed-like-) back when he was a kid. So, of course, Harry gets obsessed with Christmas, and when his disappointment gets too big, he's unleashed, dresses up like Santa Claus and wanders around town giving to toddlers and killing anyone who thinks he's naughty. <br /> <br /> Quite simply, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror movies are using the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be more "Santa Claus, the portrait of a serial killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent to document Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown when I was willing to buy the premise until the headlines were unfolding. You know a slasher movie is in trouble when you're urging the killer to deal with it already. Maybe Harry's descent could be convincing in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film and shows. The action climbs staggeringly from scene to stage, without setting shots or clear views of actors to tell us where we are and who they see. Even once the movie is running, we are still treated to help Harry's self-pity, insecurity and neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening, Evil Christmas is one to avoid.
