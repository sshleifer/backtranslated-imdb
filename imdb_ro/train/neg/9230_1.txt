We should qualify this title now that I think about it. Checkout is not totally worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I did a great laugh at the cost of the film. so I think it deserves something for that. and it also deserves the aggressive pain it caused me at my first view. as another commentator pointed out, this film is stingy in every sense of the word. no single original thought came into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise completely embarrassed for me). the film is nothing more than a long line of cliques that are gathered together and parades around them as a movie. is certainly not the next clerks, certainly not original and not absolute "good, clean fun". the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting way). when I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone except the elderly was completely bored or suffered from this film. during some particularly emotional scenes, as if Nick chews his mother, the audience gets worse because it was so badly done. I even heard somebody * grumbling * in the theater, something I have not seen before. I do not care where you have the chance to see this movie, either at a movie festival or in an indie theater or anywhere. do a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you are like me and can not resist the opportunity to see what could really be the worst movie ever made.
