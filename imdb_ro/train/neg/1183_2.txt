This, and Imoral Stories, both left the taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted with sex, and these two movies are stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it is not very well done - some of the actors are really epic evil (such as the "American" woman with French accent). The old flip-flop is not worried about marriage, about being interested (when it seems that it should have been the opposite), and the sudden realization of the aunt's young secret does not make sense - it does not explain at all. I also did not like how the relationship of a daughter with a black was presented as a sign of the perversion or the predilection of her family for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is this "sexy beast," if you want, living in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but funny story but instead used only as a base for a bad, negative, of morality.
