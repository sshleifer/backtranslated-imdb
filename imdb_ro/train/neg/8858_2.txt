Ben, a policeman outside the city, is convinced that his sister has been brutally murdered and wants to bring his killer to justice, but he is approached by Stefan who thinks his sister has been the victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, the best friend of his sister and Stephen, is traveling to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. This is incredibly terrible and I asked how he was released. Makes the original "Howling" look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, because it must be the worst performance I've ever seen. It was a lot wrong with this true-to-life movie, from the real harness and wood performances by Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget Lee), raw fashion (those Sunnys), effects cheap bells, bad use of illumination, humor ... if it existed, (with part of the film focusing on a certain unknown band), the werewolf has orgies that is a vision to see and a tedious story with a flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it were so bad it would be terrible, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positions were the position and the movie settings have looked great, but that's it ... in fact, I'll add the Sybil Danning short stripping scene too. final credits, the band sings the song in the house during a strange set of scenes in the film, which I have to ask why? A terrible piece of mess, yet at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
