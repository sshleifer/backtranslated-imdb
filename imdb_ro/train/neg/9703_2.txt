For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten, Disney has gone near the tubes until the late 1980s. People have NOT seen them in their movies and the company has not produced the usual material. At least they did not expect people. A major problem: profanity. Yes, idiots running Disney movies during that decade would produce movies with sworn words - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you can think - interspersed with these "movie families." It actually happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film, besides linguistic issues, has an ugly tone, which makes it dissatisfied almost from the beginning. Fortunately, Disney woke up and produced many extraordinary materials from these decadent films from the 1980s ("Touchstone" is Disney under another name.)
