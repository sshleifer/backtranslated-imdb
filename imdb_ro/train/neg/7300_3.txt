This movie is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a terrible meat-eating virus. Suddenly, friends return to each other in a desperate attempt to keep themselves from contracting the disease themselves. "Cabin Fever" is a horrible movie. For one, try to have many genres at once. Should it be a tribute, a slash, a black comedy or a scary movie with an unintentional comedy? No one can say. There is a serious scene at the beginning and another alter, it becomes funny. When the movie tries to be funny, the humor is pretty gentle, excluding the end. I liked it to end very much. But, besides the end, I was quite disappointed and disgusted. Violence is worthy of dignity, it looks away from the screen rather than being scared. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate on the move. Why should we get that out? The same girl would bite one of the characters. Should it have been funny? I do not know. Some of the shows were decent, and many were quite amateur. I did not care most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was terrible. As a horror movie, I did not know what it was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense or frightening. After all, you are indifferent, thinking, "What have we got through this?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
