I bought this movie from the Gamestop disc store used and the schoolbook made me laugh uncontrollably, so I bought it for 99 cents. The film itself is delayed and they use as many as ten different monkeys throughout the film, which does not look the same. Not to mention, they are using a double stunt which is just a short guy in a costume that makes a desperate attempt to adorn her with a monkey. The director has more than likely committed a suicide murder with chimpanzees after the film debuted in a preview for another low-rent Warner Bros. movie. and has come to pay money to the studio. It also does not help that he was not even grumpy about the terrible work he did, not even known for producing a robbery. Why was this movie ever made?
