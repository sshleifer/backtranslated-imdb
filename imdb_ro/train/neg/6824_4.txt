After looking at Koyaanisqatsi twice and three times and loving every second, I finally had a chance to see Life in Transformation continue. I was really disappointed, because it was not close to the high level of the first one. 90 minutes of people with baskets on my head is not my idea about a good movie. Philip Glass's score for him had neither the beauty nor the correlated power of the former. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi this film seemed slow and useless. A flattened version of Baraka, which is the same idea, but it does better. I really hope that the third film in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
