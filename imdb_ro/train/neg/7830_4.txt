So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been flawed and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, offered little to stories or real fears, but at least he was well-guided, suspenseful and visibly exciting, with solid action by William Hurt and very impressive special effects of a mini-series . However, the second story in the series was just terrible, and not good. The scenario is bad, asking the prominent, stubborn protagonists to act illogically to move the plot and have hungry characters for unusual exposure purposes. The act is overwhelmed and unconvincing and I felt more empathic for a cold blood killer in the first story than for the newborn couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the scary narrative, but with action and amateur writing, the end result looks like a first-school film project, the camera moves for its own reasons and little in the way of plotting tension. If the rest of the series continues like this, I will be disappointed. I look forward to the rate of William H. Macy and I hope he becomes a decent director and writer for his segment. So far, quality is too incoherent to predict anyway.
