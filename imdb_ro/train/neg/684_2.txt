I do not believe! Cut out sentences? Good pain! You know what? All true! Will real people talk like this? You do not think so. Good girl! Nice colleague! Raise your upper lip! Only reason gave film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. Film as a whole ridiculous if you do not like watching the endless biplane fights. It seems endless, anyway. Think of Franchot Tone's dialogue. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to call the British, they come as Irish. Tip - We, British brothers, do not make any propositions. And somehow we manage to sell the same at the same time. But that's only if I went to a really good school (which is private to you).
