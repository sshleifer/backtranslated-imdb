Wow. The only ones who review this are positively the apologists of Carpenter. I know many of them. The guys who will follow John Carpenter in celluloid squat and get a movie and proclaim him a horror work. This "movie" is total stupidity. It looks and sounds like a porn (good lord, the soundtrack is terrible ...), and it has sub-par sees action, which is shocking, because Ron Perlman is normally a really good actor. Frankly, I have no idea what Carpenter thought about when he did that. Most likely, "Beans, beans, beans ..." until somebody fed it and rolled it in a blanket for this day ... They say nothing about the abortion debate when it could have had a very central theme interesting religious anti-abortion religions feel when it is the devil's child?), but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his children acting terribly killing a bunch of people and having the city doctors trying to get them calms the hysterical pregnant brother. There is no single person in this episode or what should you go out unharmed. It's terrible. Plan 9 From Outerspace is terrible. Like a good god, please, let someone stop her before she terrifies me. Try to follow this and things the same day and your mind will explode.
