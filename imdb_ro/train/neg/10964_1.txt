I was very unlucky that I saw this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment, and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devoted fan of Lewis Carroll's "Alice", I was very excited about the film's premier, which made her more uncomfortable to look at. Normally, I'm excited about modern re-broadcasts if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this film was less a modern account and more a perversion of pop culture. The adaptation of the original characters seemed juvenile and usually turned out to be horribly annoying. It probably did not help the actors to be very good either. Most performances were ridiculous over the top, which suppose it was either because of a bad direction or an effort to offset a bad scenario. I never laughed through the length of the movie. All the jokes were references to outdated events that were not so current that they lost their long loss over time. Indeed, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is about to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. I also had to say that turning the game of croquet into a nice dance was terrible. It was undoubtedly the bottom of the movie. What a joke. You do not see this movie. After his conclusion, I was really angry.
