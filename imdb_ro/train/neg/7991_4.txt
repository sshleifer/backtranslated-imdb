The painting of mediocre stories and action saved by an authentic color - and a few moments that are truly wonderful and deeply felt. It effectively captures the delicate transition of a girl to adulthood, and deals sensitively and creatively with the cultural conflict between the family's main experiences. Unfortunately, this germ of a good film is closed in a mindless purpose by a convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict over a road construction project, the sexual life of the secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the complications of the local church policy, and beyond. And all this does not even include the real central plot, which is just about the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their whole families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized that all was supposed to happen during a summer (and that so many films were made in 1.5 hours!) Eventually the movie is melodramatic, each plot the point is predictable , there are major life-changing events and then forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely disastrous. The most shocking the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a fully foreseeable "twist"), and then the whole forgotten case is completely forgiven. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and to provide another "twist". Everything is totally mechanical, to the end, all of them connecting all the free heads (not all, just the ones the movie thinks they care.)
