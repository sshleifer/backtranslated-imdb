A student director recruits a B-rated actress (a diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror movie that her mother (a wonderful Kylie Minogue!) Tried to do 12 years ago. It's a strange choice of plot, at least, just like any Aussie horror fan knows the genre is missing out of female directors. The film has a curse on him because Molly had to kill a psychotic killer on the original set. But he's back because he needs exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are starting to die on the set. Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern "slasher", but unfortunately does not bring anything new or interesting to the table. In fact, he breaks half of Wes Craven's 1990s film. A lot of movie names in the world - creating a "Scream" (except that Aussie's name is abandoned - Jane Campion ... see how it's not that funny) and a lot of "is real or it's a movie "to the" New Nightmare ". Editing is bad, music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, the film may have a sense of humor: at one point, a girl dressed in the shooting crew tells the owner of the house she's filming: "Do not worry, we'll treat your house as if it were ours," to which he answers, "that does not mean anything to me, you look like you live in a pit!" Ha! And the ridiculous nuns of Molly were enough to not regret his hiring. - You got cocaine here? (when he walks in the car maker's car) and "Does anyone know where to buy tofu?" (the first thing he mumbled on the stage) and "Where the fuck is my agent?" (oh, wait, that's what I was thinking for her.)
