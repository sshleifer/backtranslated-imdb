Rex Reed once said about a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that seems to have been shot through pomegranate juice. I was reminded of this when I snore through Butterfly Purple. It was penetrated by gauze. The story was boring and it was not helped that, for large portions of scenes, actors' faces were literally unconcentrated or focused only after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> Also, everyone looked the same, so it was hard to distinguish between characters. I call this syndrome "Society of Dead Poets". There was no one to care, no one to be interested in dramatically, and the film did not show historical light in a very interesting time and a set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
