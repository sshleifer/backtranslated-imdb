Utter dreck. We reached 16 minutes / 27 seconds, and I quit. I would have given him a negative number review if possible (although "pissible" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically felt between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between Dicky Crenna's madman and what she's here is just nonexistent. Anklet becomes an unattractive bracelet? Is not there any sign of finger grip? And I thought I would be SICK when they had a Lee J. Cobb (and rightly so you would think me) as Keyes, virtually defeating his "Little Man" explanation to Mr. Garloupis . Without offense for the blind, but it seems that a possession of the blind has run amuck with the design of both the Dietrichson House and the Neff House. The same thing happens to those horrible pants that Phyllis carries. And criticizes, how long does Neff do, that he lives with a huge marina? This, folks, again all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can move more, you have a stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist. But please, first take an Alka-Seltzer or develop a "small man" of yours that can never disappear. Proceed with caution, obviously.
