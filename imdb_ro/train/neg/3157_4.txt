Of course, he had some of the achievements of a good film. The story is good, if it's a little gentle, and the act was pretty good, though I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such an accent in her Australian accent if her character was supposed to be raised in the US. The biggest problem, however, was with the closet. I know, as a rule, that the average American is considered a wardrobe of any European who respects himself, but this has gone beyond this. Anna's color combinations were scary! And that sad apology as a potato bag, which she wore throughout the film, made me burst into the hives. I suppose the idea was as realistic as possible (how many school teachers go to Prada?) But it simply does not mean an absolute lack of taste. A word for the wise ...
