You can offer JMS and boys a cross over this because they were at the beginning of their series and at a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Do not get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I was an executioner seeing this movie, I would not have ordered the series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly and there are tons of clips. The same can be said for most of the first season (except Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set a fire in the series and became an amazing show. If you are a B5 fan and you have not seen this movie, see it. If you're not a B5 fan, you ... do not want to watch the series.
