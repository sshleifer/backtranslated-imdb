The guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and I think one day he said; I should choose an inexpensive scenario, try to put a title as big as a cup (because after all, I'm a title designer) and try to convince people that it's actually a movie. One of the worst things I've ever seen is safe. If you have the need to see beautiful titles, visit some posters, do not waste your time watching this. It's kind of ironic, do not you think you saw the poster? the only part of the project he should have done was almost done!
