<br /> <br /> We would expect a movie with a renowned comedian in the lead role of being a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud throughout the film, and that was not even during the final comedy scene (which is also expected to be the most amusing). This is one you can watch when it comes to television, do not spend more money renting it.
