This movie must have been the worst absolute movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent the Zodiac (2007) and they took it by chance. thought it was a joke before the real movie. this was awfully awesome that it was scary and never did. this movie had no real facts about the real Zodiac killer. Clearly, the directors did not even bother to investigate anything about crime ... he just liked his name ... so they decided to write a script about anything that did not apply to his name. I'm angry I did not realize the movie was not earlier. I'm trying to like something in every movie, I do not hate movies ... ever ... except this movie. If you had not given him stars, I would certainly have. 1 out of 10.
