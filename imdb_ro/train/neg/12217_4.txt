As low budget indies, you will usually find that you get what you pay, and let me just say, I did not pay much for "Frightworld" ... Writer / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of a park of abandoned amusements, besieged by the revenge of a serial killer. It is not a bad premise, but it is executed with a bunch of low budget mistakes. Works on the camera are trying to be too clear to his audience, using constantly quick cuts to cover that they have nothing bad or scary to show us. This is obvious on bats, as we have presented to the killer who would have wanted us and soon we realize that the act is the most scary thing that happens ... After a painful title sequence long, we are brought into modern times, yet the act remains the same. "Frightworld" generates a unique cinema when it shows landscapes inside the fun house, but with an extremely long operating life, can not save the film from the inferior indie. is a mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the rescue grace for these types of movies. Fans of really bad B movies might find something interesting here, otherwise they do not spend a lot of money.
