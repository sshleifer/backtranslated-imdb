I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, it does not receive "respect" from me. I looked at it only because my wife wanted to see her and found out exactly what I was expecting: a bad story without real humor. It's full of jokes, raw jokes, and a ridiculous story that is rolling around a developer (Dangerfield) who plans to build a ski resort in Utah that will not catch my attention at all. In addition to Dangerfield, the film played a poor cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and everything above John Byner Hill (I did not even know he was around until I saw his name in the credits for that). <br /> <This is really a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
