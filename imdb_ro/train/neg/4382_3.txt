The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I've watched probably has the most interesting line of facts dealing with the relationship of the woman investigating the White Prostitution Missile that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her hometown, New York! The film is populated by veterans from the series that inexplicably play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (present as head of a United Nations committee for third world countries), Karin Shubert (as a rival reporter feminist) Don Powell (as Rassimov's driver). Unfortunately, as usual, with this type of movie (despite having been presented in the evening), a very graphic scene (described in Stracultr), in which a slave trader from Asia earned income by being sodomized by a dog, nowhere can be seen here! However, a disturbing sequence of the film when a politician disturbs some girls (including Gemser and Shubert) in a midnight meeting under a bridge from New York, with a group of sticks (this is how he gets the votes, understand him!) - with his tall friends of society who look with giddiness - seems quite intact. this entry - besides the Gems (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her trip to India to interview a charlatan / guru (George Eastman made to considerably show Christ!) who found a way to prolong the coitus and, of course, when Emanuelle calls him, he gets to have premature ejaculation ...!
