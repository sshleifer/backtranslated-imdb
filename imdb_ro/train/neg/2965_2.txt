This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to look at a faculty class about India, but synopsa tells you that this movie is about one thing when it does not contain too much cold and heavy information on these details. It is not true the synoptic to the end in which it tries to link all the elements together. However, the gore factor is superb. Right from the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see some gore, because the plot is thin and it will make you sad that you have lost time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other sites about the fact that this movie is based on true events, however you can not find information about it online ... so this movie was a waste of time to watch.
