Kareena Kapoor in a hmmmmmmmm bikini. <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Good Banner .. Kareena Kapoor in a Bikini ..... <br /> <br /> It's not a good reason not to see this movie .... Or so I thought. ....... Did not these people make JBJ ... <br /> <Why did I forget about it. For all the criticisms, the first half of the movie is not that bad ... There are intrigue and THREE TO GET A SORT OF EXCITMENT MIXED IREITES WHICH WALKED WHEN RITCH PHOTOGRAPHY LOCK STOCK and SNATCH. Kareena Kapoor is a very thin type of fashion. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as he may be just him. Anil Kapoor is annoying, but quite funny, you MUST use the most in the time you do not understand. <br /> <br /> Saif is that main Khiladi side .. once again. There are occasional laughs and some chuckles and some pockets during the Kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my motorcycle). But most often this half promises more than it is delivered ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Moreover, there were things to come. <br /> <br /> INSTEAD we have been treated to lick the torture count, which is difficult to put into Words. Saif abruptly cage as a comic strip ... <br /> <br /> <br /> VERY VERY SEXY WORD KAREENA LOOKS ANOREXICALLY, REALIZE HOW THE FIRST FRIEND IS DEVALED AND MAKES HIGH FOR THE CORP (only girls can observe this and make other guys observe the second floor was my observation) ANIL KAPOOR AND SIDEKICS WIN ON YOUR NERVES. Akshay Kumar is the only one who takes madness to some extent, but even he becomes intolerable after a while. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> WHY? !! WHAT THE??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! What I did to keep this ... A collective air passed through the audience before each song in the second half, which was common even without the movie around it. <br /> <br /> I can not relieve the trauma .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. This movie starts from a pocket that you feel could even take it to a height, but still moves to a win and you can quickly make a full blown attack. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, the first half of the year. <br /> <br /> +/- is what, when, how, who in a lot of confusion. (The need for a book to fill this up). (requires many pages to fill this up). Total 3/10 (trying to avoid 1s and 2s too does not seem extreme but makes no mistake this movie is undecid, no matter how decent the first half is).
