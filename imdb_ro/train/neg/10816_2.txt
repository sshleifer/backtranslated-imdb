Just what I needed, another movie about England in the nineteenth century. Which is a bit like ordinary England, Vandal football stadiums to anyone. In this picturesque scene of gentlemen, dames and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg walks unnecessarily like Jane Eyre, from that novel that no one has ever read at will. in Mr. Rochterster's bed, where he tries to teach a French girl to look at the empty sheet all the time. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt on autopilot) is back to fall in love with Jane and all this, but it's still his wife's fruit cake problem that's locked in the bridge. Oops, it was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some of them spread the fire carefully (probably leased the set), the film finally comes to an end. Everything really looks real, it's something I think. But then again, no.
