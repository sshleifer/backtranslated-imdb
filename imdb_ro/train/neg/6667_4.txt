was a way to enjoy this film up to Ed Norton's facial hair issues. Without disclosing details of the plot - one afternoon she had a light beard, but the same night the beard had disappeared and a very lush mustache. It was much fuller than the mustache that went with the beard. Later, during an open night in the open, the mustache disappeared and he appeared to cleanse the paradise. This was an opportunity where stopping to shake would not be an option. These continuity discrepancies amused me completely with the rest of the film and destroyed any credibility I had previously had. I also learned that the long scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was too much for De Niro to remember in the Taxi Driver. Even if it should have been a tribute, it was too much for this viewer.
