I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I wasted a few hours of my life actually looking at this movie, I still do not think I could see it altogether. Was there really a point in the movie? And the end, okay, I'm glad I never paid to see this expensive unnecessary piece of pathetic excuse for a movie! I'm not sure without hunting the deeds but Dafoe is married or I see the terrifying actress in this real-life movie if it was such a kick-start attempt to start her career if she's so afraid she must have failed. I post in the hope that I can sing someone to watch this movie, even if one person considers my comments and decides she would rather look at drying the paint, I will feel like I did something good in the world if just have the same advice ...
