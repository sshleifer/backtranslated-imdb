I think if you are like science-fi and horror it might be interesting. The act was fine, but not great. The two pregnant girls should be fifteen, but they are interpreted by obviously larger actresses that turned out to be twenty-one at the time. The plot is fine, but the story jumps around, letting you guess if you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as having a secret sect to investigate events that happen only with those beliefs. And if the two girls were Protestant? Would Catholics be cared for? Therefore, some controversial. Who knows, one day the Catholic Church could learn even what the Bible teaches. If you miss that, you do not feel you've lost anything.
