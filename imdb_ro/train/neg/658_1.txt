I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came to IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the predictable and cheesy movie with a terrible dialogue. I never stopped the opinions of others, so I lost seven dollars for this movie. It had to be one of the biggest movies I've ever seen. The person who wrote the script should be pushed out of a rock. Since scary movies have scary scenes? I swear, I am amazed that there were no GROUP HUG ^ - ^ moments. I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I was zoning out, thinking about my research paper for English. Closed, birds / cats that came out of nowhere when you thought something was going to happen. And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm disappeared, and the main character said, "I have to bring my mother's shawl!" You. Idiotic. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps, but NOT, my mother's shawl (which did not match the Apropo dress) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And all the way, I go back to her house, knowing the killer knew where she was living. God. And my friend and I guessed the whole movie. And not only, I bet he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was "He stole the bellhop's clothes and slipped out of the hotel" and "It's the detective down the hall, not the killer!" moments. Movies should NOT be PRESENT. Disney movies are not that predictable. I'll finish my boredom now that it was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see him in theaters, so I would not have bought it for $ 15.00 and then I hate it. It was bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen into the same position as he was shot. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing face down. Oh, how wonderful it was. Do not waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
