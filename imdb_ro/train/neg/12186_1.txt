This remake of the original 1962 film has a very good part to appreciate and some beautiful performances by some good actors - however, Scorsese opts for the final for the most formidable reversal of the plot and a confused Shakespearean resignation that had forgotten me You're at my watch. DeNiro is a gorgeous actor dedicated to giving him everything in the work he does, yet he needs direction to concentrate his talent, and this is extremely devoid of the last five minutes of the movie. Gregory Peck's cat is useful, but nothing more while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with so few lines like this one. Nick Nolte turns into a better performance than Lorenzo's oil but is not in the same form as "weeds." Joe Don Baker has some wonderful lines, while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes passes through a generation. A few good points? The start credits (!), Cody's first look at diving in prison, the scene in which Cody is attacked by baseball bats, animated by Sam Bowden in lively panic, Cody's presence on the other. <br /> Worst? "The woman clean - BUT NOT REAL !!!" part. He clutches his empty hand at the bottom of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Is not there a hit in the USA?) "It's Dead - BUT NO REALITY!" partS and the previous end. We could look at the original again, but I was still tempted to see the remake four years after I saw it.
