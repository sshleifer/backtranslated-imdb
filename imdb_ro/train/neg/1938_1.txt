Where to start? The son of Amitabh, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30. Amitabh has been in prison for 33+ years ... he's telepathic transport of sperm at home? B) Has he asked Pakistani brilliant guard to send him for him? C) They allow conjugal visits to pagan prisons of pagans <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E ) Did the producers have a bit too much bhang at the time they approved the scenario? Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - she's yum, yum, yummy ... and she seems to want her - who is not she? ... But when her father laughed and then killed (hardly think it's a "spoiler", as you should be dead brain and blind to not see this coming into the movie) is quite excited about this catastrophe and with the (metaphorical) tip of her hat, let her back to save her father, not to take care of her loss and say (paraphrasing) "If God wants it, we will meet again." .. Understand, essentially, "I would have done my job, I'm sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!" - Calus beyond Hollywood standards with a low life ... <br / > <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this horrible time-loss movie, that you can drive all the jeeps, truck camels and all other things through it Pass - total and total loss of time - Oh! There is a great succession of dance (yes, only one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) watching just for that. Hire Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan take lesson lessons?) For better movies in conflict with Indo-Pak ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
