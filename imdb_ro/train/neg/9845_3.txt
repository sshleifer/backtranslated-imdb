!!!! When I first looked at WIN like SIN, I could not believe it was done in 1993 because it played as a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone in the mid-80s. It begins with a murder and is left to the audience to move "It's guilty or innocent and lying with his lawyer," but in the middle of the film he shows his credentials in the 90's by turning into a "Lawyer becomes manipulated and watched by his client's movie "which ends in a ridiculous manner, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous end in this regard. This is a very poor thriller but the most amazing thing about it was that Sidney Lumet was directed by the same man who brought us into the classical drama of the 12 ANGRY MEN
