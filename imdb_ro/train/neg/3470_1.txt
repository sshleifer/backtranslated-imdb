As in most of Ben Affleck's films, the comedy is dry, and the story is predictable. That's if you want to tell a story. Many points remained in connection with no thought. I want to thank the Director for not explaining the points better. I say this because that would mean torture would have taken longer. As for Ben Affleck's failures, this is no exception and is only survived by the other actors. Even then, the act was largely invented and not credible. Traveling down the tape with the actors I have not seen for years is not worth the admission. Everyone thought they should be told, and they quickly joined the lines "it was". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or to watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. Generally, I would give her a laugh ... mainly because that's all I got out of it.
