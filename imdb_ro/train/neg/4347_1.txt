Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says this is at the end of the 60s ... which means that Carlito would be very close to going to jail, went out in 75 years and said he was five years old. They used a bunch of actors and a story that did not make any sense. They bring back just one actor, Guzman, and they play a completely different guy. Why did he end up with this Puerto Rican rifle? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You think he'd been in this. And if that made sense, where are Rocco and the black guy in the first? It was just bad ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
