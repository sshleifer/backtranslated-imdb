Yes, this movie makes me feel terrible when I realized I paid for it and spent more than an hour of my life trying to follow her. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being a psycho-Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time avoiding this movie, I understand that a movie requires money to be created and that some movies do not have that money, but that's not a justification for a bad plot and a bad action. I always support independent films when they deserve support, but movies like this make a bad name for such films. I'm still traumatized. I do not trust any beautiful cover anymore.
