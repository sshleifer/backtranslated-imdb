Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic movies (just watch Oscar nominations each year). But still, the good ones are really a form of art. Look at "When Harry Meets Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle," and classic as "Roman Holiday" and "It's Happened a Night." I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. This movie is trying to build something that looks like a romantic comedy. But nobody believes romanticism among the main characters and it is nothing fun to solve this major shortcoming. Modine is much older than a leading man - especially a romantic advantage. I'm sure, as an executive producer, he had the means - but not the common sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see the possibilities of a comedy talent, but he did not have a script or a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Useless. <br /> <br /> Others have told him, but I want to repeat: this story is badly conceived, poorly executed; actors are terribly mischievous; and the characters, well, does not give us anything. One form of art is not so. Go on rent "Moonstruck" again.
