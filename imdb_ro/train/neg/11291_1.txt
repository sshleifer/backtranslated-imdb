Sheesh! What a terrible movie. Working with the camera, a scenario with more corn than Kellogg, and acting so strange that you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> In order to limit everything, does not he know which audience to target - we have Cornel Wilde - or is Corny Wilde? - to put on the soap box the dangers of smoking whenever someone lights a cigarette, dear dear, and in another unpleasant scene we have Baddie, Lobo, forcing them, if you want, a "male friend" striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain that one for kids ... <br /> <br /> Throw into a highly controversial Treasure Island-cum-jaws story, and the result is such an unintentionally funny movie, it's nice - you should not I'm waiting for a special DVD edition anytime soon.
