It's a good thing The score came for Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I would not like to think of him going to Free Money. It's not what his fans should remind him of. Brando, in his last years, looks more like Orson Welles, and Free Money is the type of film Welles sought to fund his own business. Brando is the director of a local prison that in America, when in a small rural setting, is usually the largest employer in the area. That gives a person who has a very big influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has only one weakness he indulges, the two known twins, otherwise, as daughters. Even when they remain at the same time charged by a pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and the Church of Thomas Haden, their hearts still belong to Dad. Do not be afraid because Brando wants to give them jobs in prison where they work under conditions that are not much better than convicts. What to do, but to commit a robbery of a train passing through the locality, which often transports the money used to be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has some moments of humor, it is often under the talent of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as equally corrupt judge, and Mira Sorvino as a stepfather, but also a direct agent of the FBI. Of course, these people and other castors have worked with someone who many of them are the greatest American actor in the last century. If it was not for Brando's presence and 40 years earlier, Free Money would have played the drive-in circuit in Red State America, where the population could see how they were satirized. attempts are made to satirize them.
