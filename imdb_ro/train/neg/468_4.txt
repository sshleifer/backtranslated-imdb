Before commenting on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked this was to resume something I saw for TV ads in 1980: Barbara Bach's detachment. And since the movie was rated R, I was expecting her to see her naked. Unfortunately, no dice for her or another gorgeous actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, who was supposed to be a teenager, but she was 20 years old when she did. Seeing her in a bra and panties and later in a belly dancer, she was as exciting as Mrs. Bach. They offer some of the scattered laughter offered by this movie. Actually, I do not blame Ron Leibman for his name was removed from credits because his role as scary Liceman is embarrassing, although I liked the "seduction" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin. It also happens to be the debut of Ralph Macchio, who is the only one who has been sent to an academic school. The others are a black child who really loves his stepmother and Mrs. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil and a son of a politician who loves Candy's friend so much (Nelkin's character), risks being Sneak in the middle of the night sees her in the girls academy. Among his support, Tom Poston plays a delicate character called Sisson, which we found somewhat funny. With a scenario by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and directed by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has an early cameo in a soccer scene), the academy is uneven with politically humorous humor but if you are not genuinely offensive to scatological and sexual content, it is actually a fairly harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and her name covers the boy - Alfred E. Newman - not to be ashamed even if they have given up their name and character their. .ps Another "failed" was Harry Teinowitz, who was born in my hometown Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert. Also, say one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
