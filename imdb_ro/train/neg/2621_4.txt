I would not bring a child under 8 to see that. With the puppies spinning from buildings scraping dangerous cars and listening to Cruella's scowling laugh, to name a few of the events, there is too much suspense for a small child. <br /> <br /> Live action gives a more dizzying feeling than the cartoon version and there are some unsettling moments, including a guy who seems to be a travesty, lots of tense moments that will make you worry and scare you down children. I do not know what Disney people were thinking, but neither the story nor the act were at their usual level. The puppies are nice. But this movie is the best.
