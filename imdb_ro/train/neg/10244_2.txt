I'm working as a concierge hotel in Washington DC and I'm talking to you, there was nothing exactly about the character played by Michael J. Fox - # 1 we just do not walk through our tickets with theater tickets and $ 100 bills ! # 2 If I ever let anyone use a room for an afternoon afternoon, I would have fired at the scene! The organization they belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very clear standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly, it was unclear at the end of the movie that Doug was simply removing his golden emblem and sending it to another employee - we win those keys and is a badge of honor and knowledge to be left to wear their. There is an entire application and a process of joining our organization. This film does nothing to dispel the unhappy perception of a concierge as a mercenary who is scaring money. In short, it serves for our organization. I welcome the comments.
