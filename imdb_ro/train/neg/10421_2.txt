I saw this movie as a very young girl (27 years ago) and I've been scared for years. We had nightmares about every aspect of this movie, from how it was attracted to music to (obviously) violence. My parents are still wondering who allowed me to look at her and both of them say they will not let me look at such a movie. I think they just say that I have such strong feelings about it;)) I am currently reading the book (from morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and it is indeed a wonderful story. However, I do not think it should have been done in a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe the kids find strange kids today, but it has given me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I still have difficulty seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way. Give me a little palpitations every time. Yeah, I'm a wuss, but I strongly suggest that any parent is looking to show this movie to their children, read their book instead, or look at it first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone thinks it's as disturbing as we did, but we're there; 0)
