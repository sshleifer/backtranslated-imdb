While I certainly think the Exorcist is a classic of horror, I have to admit that I do not keep it as big as many fans of horror. As a consequence of this, I have not seen much of Exorcist's replies and if Exorcismo is something to go through, I will have to say that it's a good thing, because this movie is boring like hell and certainly is not worth spending ninety minutes ! Correctly to other exorcists, this is often considered one of the worst, so maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: it's essentially the same thing with the Exorcist and he sees a girl possessed by a demonic spirit (who happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The priest in the village is called to carry out the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, he sees Paul Naschy, which is the best thing about the film. Exorcism was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish derivative Giallo "The Killer Wore Gloves". I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of the two: I think originality was not one of its strong points. There are not many good things I can say about the movie itself; more is happening than is happening and the exorcism score is not worth it. I certainly do not recommend it!
