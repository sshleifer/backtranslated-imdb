This science fiction adventure is not the best and in no case the worst. I agree with the assertion that evil sci-fi is comic. Bizarre pink shades and unusual special effects make this a favorite for viewers late, late, late. Space explorers on Mars are struggling with strange monsters of giant amoeba and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. In the cast are Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfort and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you start for a moment. I agree with adding this to the classic worship list to not lose.
