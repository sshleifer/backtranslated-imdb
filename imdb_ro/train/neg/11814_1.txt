Back in the day, I remembered seeing some comic strips of Nintendo Power, which had the same artwork as this show ... and then came the word that this show was a show on a TV beside me ! I was not estatic, but curious ... I was curious to find out how bad the show was. All my friends have told me that this show has no real meaning and was too stupid for people to enjoy (they are actually gay), so I decided to see the show with low expectations. A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and hate how many fans sink over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how Kalasaki chef (or whatever his unfortunate name was) was a good guy who owned a restaurant. Move bad, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a missed advisor to King Dedede (who sucks long in this show) and hates the face of that company that continues to supply Dedede with those terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So bad, I hate this show. Then I started to hate Kirby even more, since it was obvious that Nintendo was just a pain to get popularity for Kirby. Kirby would never have beaten Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby would always be just a little goose puff. NUF SAID !!!
