I was in a movie with a group because the song I was going to was canceled. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever. It's not like I do not like cult movies. But nothing happens in the movie. There's no connection with the characters. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How to wear a huge tent and chairs and bedclothes for every day of that car? It's a two-seater! I have to say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director would have had to make a movie about the movie so that we could skip 80 minutes of useless time without anything happening. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this because it is a waste of your time
