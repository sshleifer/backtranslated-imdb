Do not waste time with this movie. This is a total quake in terms of acting, direction, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a loss of performance by some very good actors. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is probably one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also a budding star, has done a pretty bad job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call this? I mean, he should thank God for having a beautiful girl, otherwise he would win Razzie in India if there were awards in Bollywood. Asrani has a great talent, but he's overcoming his difficulties, as before. The scenario I did not mention a 1965 Boeing Boeing was pretty serious. First of all, people in Bollywood can not do anything original. Moreover, I do not even know how to copy well. The banknotes in the film were so troublesome that it was painful to stay with them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he is not fit to make a decent Hindi film. Editing the sound is amazingly crappy. I can continue on this issue, but the point is that Bollywood should be shameful to make such a movie. The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What's wrong with you? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood produces more films than Hollywood each year, but most of the films are unheard of abroad because of movies like this one. I'm an Indian and I'm absolutely shameful of Bollywood for producing this thrash piece. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were great. These are world-class films that are immortal ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala is probably one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10.
