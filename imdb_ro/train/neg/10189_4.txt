I saw this movie years ago and I was impressed ... but again, I was only 12 years old. I recently reviewed her and I want to come back. This movie is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to see a GOOD movie that he was ... by Meatballs (also Bill Murray) for some laugh) and Burgess Meredith, this role did / did nothing for their career. However, Lee Majors' character, Franklyn Hart, is an ex-race car driver who plans to run the racing car (he has in store) across California. One problem: The government has outlawed any private transport. I thought the concept was OK (not so bad I heard of), but the execution failed awfully.
