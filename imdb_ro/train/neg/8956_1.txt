Pretty disappointing prequel in the first two films, he has neither the first suspense nor the second interest. Focusing on the boys who "run" the cube, virtually eliminates any sense of tension within the cube, because we simply do not care about the characters inside. Much of the movie is simply dull and becomes really terrible only by the introduction of the eye with the glass and the mad with the green eyes. Afterwards, however, she descends into an unintentional hilarity above. The end, however, fits, linking it back in the first in an indirect way. The scenario is terrible, at best mediocre and non-impressive. A much smaller tracking.
