OK, people, honestly ... this must be one of the worst movies about the biz show ever made, but I laughed at myself stupidly (maybe why I liked it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and a way to get your own 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? If you have a thing that goes for bizzard characters and easy fun, watch this movie when you have the chance (and you have something better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention, spoilers! *** The funniest thing on the film was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry the goat (!) In the show and light his wallet with his love of pictures. A triple A for a bad and fun taste!
