Even though Frank Loesser's songs are some of the best Broadway has to offer, they are dominated by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's lethargic scenography and uninspired presentation - when it's over, you barely feel like you've been watching a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to be able to present the provocative songs, but Loesser's thunder for a maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, "Adelaide's Lament," ends with the Adelaide belt (Vivian Blaine) a lounger; and Stubby's faux-spiritual Kaye 'Sit down, Te Rockin' The Boat 'of his support choir sitting in folding chairs while he just stays there. Mankiewicz writes all the fun of everything, allowing static scenes going on for too long and his dialogue (adapted from the Abe Burrows stage book) has none of the spirit that his films such as 'Everything about Eve' have. Some part of the blame has to go to management, almost everyone is mistakast: Marlon Brando looks amazed why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a guy too nice and has no edge that makes him so essential (the pieces do not are adapted to his style), and Jean Simmons barely records how a Shirley Jones might be. Only Blaine, as showgirl lovablen Adelaide, orders us to be a Broadway projector. The direction of the colorful art is by Joseph Wright, and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets.
