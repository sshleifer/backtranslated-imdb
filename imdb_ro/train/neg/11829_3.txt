I walked into this movie after seeing Borat for 82 minutes tonight and I was rather disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit, and we usually go see animated movies. Having said that, I woke up and at one point I almost came out, but I was waiting for this movie to improve. They have never happened. The images are amazing and your work is top, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remember a few times that screwdriver Gandalf and Magneto screwdriver). The problem with this movie for me is one of those animated features for the ADD. It is, after all, recorded as a roughened routine after another, weighed by a plot full of roses, which pulls each stop in an attempt to convey an "important message". It looks a lot like an animated Oscar bait for the animated category, and given the way she gets criticism, I would not be surprised if the academy makes it wrong and provides the hardware. But if you're looking for a nice animated trait about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
