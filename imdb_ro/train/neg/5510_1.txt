Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is barely in it. Most of the time on the screen is dominated by unpleasant jokes. A gag that runs is that a character is called Jerk Off. There is also a lot of erection jokes, where the punch line is someone has an erection. This movie is just as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent is convincing. This movie started out as a weak action movie: five minutes of story back and then bam! Jokes without jokes. But, apart from the terrible letter, the film is also badly directed and the acting is terrible. Also, this film makes the old bad comedy clich√© to have a lot of actors known in the film B. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of those who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, although he is called the main character. Do not be surprised to find this movie at a drug store that sells five dollars. Even that's too much.
