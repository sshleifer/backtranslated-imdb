The bridegroom dies at the altar, and their bodies disappear. Nobody knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters), notes that each bride wears a strange orchid and goes to an interview with her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now, Dr. Lorenz is a crazy scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in the coffin and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> Corpse Vanishes has an interesting concern and a short enough time to not be able to get bored. Unfortunately, as it starts pretty well, it begins to pull ahead of half way and becomes quite boring with its clich√©s and the predictable plot. There are some good things about this - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and behaves brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, suave, aloof and very courageous countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here. Maintains a bit of Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. But overall, it has just failed to keep my interest in the whole picture, and for this I have to evaluate it badly.
