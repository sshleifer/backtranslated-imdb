As I pass through the channels on a late Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His accent was breaking so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. Then I was amazed to find out that this movie was made after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film plays stereotypes, with the inspirational figure figure. The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And, this movie won a prize? I can not believe. Brosnan is an appealing man, but I really wanted to think about our eyes after watching this for just 10 seconds. We went from "Kicking and Screaming" to that and we wanted to go back. I watched the classic children of 1995, "Indian in the closet" earlier in the night, who also discussed Iroquois. The following line is our desire to flee: "Take me out, grasper the earth." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to look."
