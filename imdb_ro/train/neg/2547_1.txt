I have not seen her for more than twenty years. JO was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tourist guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper. Yes, Lorenzo showed a lot like a negative character, a natural man. I think I looked back then, most of all for JO, which I saw on Turning Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also on Art Johnson. I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. > Yes, he changed the plots. While reading other posts, I remember that it was a plot to kidnap a rich girl, but then that invaluable stamp business came out of the blue. Did I go, a stamp? If it appeared as a late film, I probably register it to check it out again, but I would not be nostalgic for it. Not yet, anyway. There are better movies in the seventies that this is to be checked.
