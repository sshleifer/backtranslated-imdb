I hired this movie because I sail through the horror movie section for those movies that nobody heard about and could be a possible gem. I have seen this, and since I am a fan of violence and gore, I have succeeded. He received the EM rating which means: Extremely Mature. Thinking that this tiny and tall assessment was all about violence and everything else, we succeeded. Warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge and Nudity. "Extreme Violence" hit my fantasy. The film ended, being a pretty hard movie. It had one or two violent scenes, but I saw it worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of gore in a movie is not everything that matters, is it? And you have a plot. Well, the story was boring and there was nothing special. Do not rent it. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine how somebody really can really enjoy it where they say, "I'm going to reward it again." They had moments in which he kept you, but I'll never see this movie again.
