That reminds me of when I was a newborn believer to be minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even a high school graduate, because I was almost positive that I'd been kidnapped in Heaven before that ever happened. That was before discovering that Christianity was a garbage. Now I am an atheist, and this proves that the "doctorate they have always saved", which Christians tell us, is no longer real but elves. If that were true, why did we go after many years of being a faithful newborn devotee? Yeah, I just saved myself. I prayed that sinful prayer with all my heart. If Christians read the Bible, they would find that their god thinks that rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are all right for him. They may be surprised to find that it is not about the word "abduction" mentioned.
