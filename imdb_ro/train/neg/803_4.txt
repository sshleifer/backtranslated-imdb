I read Ben Mezrich's novel Reaper a few years ago, and last night I accidentally came to see this adaptation. Although years have passed since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the film are humorous. The very important elements that made everything plausible are just written or changed to evil. If the plot seems interesting to you: go and bring your novel. Much, much, much better. 4 out of 10, since it was hard not to watch because of Ben Mezrich's big plot.
