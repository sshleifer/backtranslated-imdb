This film has no way of recommending it, although little is the landscape, the cinema and the wildlife, it is difficult to bring its weaknesses into the company of such rave reviews. However, these very things make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end. Yes, the photos were wonderful, the landscapes along the forest and the magnificent mountains, but what happened in the foreground? The rather boring narrative of the stupidity of a teasing girl who learns too slowly a basic lesson about wildlife friendship - and comes down quite easily, given the history of this kind of thing. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing new about the way it is said, and we have all seen this before and indeed more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. /> The only thing that could really be harvested from this movie is a feeling of working with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
