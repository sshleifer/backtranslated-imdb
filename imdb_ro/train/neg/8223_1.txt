Surely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions! Controversies in this opinion could argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as the others because it is an independent, low-budget movie, but do I already have it? amateurism and weak innovation are scary. In line with everything that has been said about this movie, for example, the mind, strangely, acting poorly (when it's bad to make another move to the scene, damn it), which we found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the scenario, assuming that there was such a thing during production. Was there a clear lack of dialogue with respect for viewers, the girls changed personalities several times, and seemed to show no rationality or even brains - five relatively suited girls against a small female psychopath? beat her, why not? The only thing that can be considered a conquest for this title is the room that does not leave the van at any moment, so that the viewer sees everything inside him - that is, like the rest of the film, a good idea exponentially executed scary. oh, and by the way, this NIMIC movie is like the Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or anything else with a camera shot? this is an effect and not a feature! Used intelligently, it can be staggering, but in this case it is an excuse for inappropriate cinema.
