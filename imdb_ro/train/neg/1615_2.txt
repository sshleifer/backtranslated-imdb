The same ancient old about Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg replayed the same boring narrative of Che. The seductive story of a rich Argentinean boy who was so shocked by poverty became Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor until he was killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, they heard everything before, HEALTH AND UNTRUE! Che Guevara's reality is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian one-month-old who wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that, at the hottest cold war, he even asked the Soviet Union to breastfeed New York, Washington, or Los Angeles and take the end of the world. He urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he said if his finger was on the button, he would have been pushed. When Khrushchev retired and literally saved the world, Che was angry at "betrayal." If you followed Che's recommendations, you did not read this review now. How a killer maniac has become a pop icon would have made a movie more exciting. It was unbelievable that no director was bold enough to show Che's real part and his post-media transformation. WAS A FILM OF OZCAR EARNING! I thought about making an independent film mean to take REAL RISKS and be CARE! They are abstaining from the "safe counter-culture", "cool", "bad", "republican = nazi", "bush ex hitler", "NRA is worse than the KGB," "Christians are fanatical and stupid" , etc ... ad nauseum. Oooh, how bold, how stiff the mind. Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I would like to have some real coyotes and deal with the Independent Film Oligarchy! He would be really bold!
