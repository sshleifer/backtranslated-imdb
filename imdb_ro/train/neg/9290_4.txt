STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Detained for a long time, Twitch (Kurupt) becomes himself, a tougher prison than Alcatraz reopened. He claims to be closer to his lady, but his real motives are more grandiose. There he crosses the paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg), a voluminous prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthful and almost the same. But there is a war between the groups of black and Italian detainees who explode in a hostile takeover of the prison when the black gang leader is shot dead and his finger shows Burke. But Sh! T really hits the fan when true murderer and leader of Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid), takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does not make a sequel to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and he just agreed to do so provided the film company he was at that time to straighten his own movie) so, despite the fact that it was a continuation of the DVD, the main role is this time for Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in the movie from the first film that appears until the end). But there's a reason he did not do too much from Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not a big actor and not a star for action, managing a character that starts out as very dark and confrontational, but deceptive turns into a standard action hero quipping off dull un-liners. The wise supporters, veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, only jumped to the chance to work extra. This is a movie that tried to copy the style of the original pretty well, dim light, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. She does this quite well, unfortunately, she can not face a hero who does not deal with a cartoon villain and an apathetic story that the producers seem to have done while they were going. **
