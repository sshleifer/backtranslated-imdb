Although two years have passed, I still remember the complete waste that encompasses the entire story of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it as I navigate through the new versions of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie, because it was the only one we did not all see and sounds like it would be nice. Although it has been a while since I saw the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no real plot) and the complete loss of time spent watching the film. If you are in the video store and this movie captures your eye, go ahead and find a better movie. If you've finished seeing this movie, I understand your pain :)
