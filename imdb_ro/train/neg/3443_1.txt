I saw this movie last night and I hoped for the best after watching all the refreshing trailers. Even the cover of the DVD looks good. As soon as I started looking, I thought others were, "Oh, my God what this is." moments that were a bit scary, but then the mood was ruined by bad music. It was rock and opera during what had to be suspense scenes. That really ruined me for me and shook my head thinking of renting it and was deceived by the cover art.Nothing against the music itself was just in the wrong parts of the movie. Who edited the movie has no idea what they are doing. Coverage showed the lightning, suggesting they were caught in the sea storm. That would have been more interesting, but it did not happen. The actor was not the worst I've ever seen as being unknown, and that's obviously their first film. Another reason I was disappointed was the senseless intrigue. At first, 2 men saw that all the teenagers were in the boat, then at the end it was assumed that there was only one girl and the others were either her imaginary friends, or the ghosts are not sure because she was very poorly portrayed. WhyteFox who wrote a comment here claims that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area where this movie was shot. There was no mention in this movie about being a true story. I've never experienced this personally, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I think if someone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like horror films for amateur students, you may like it.
