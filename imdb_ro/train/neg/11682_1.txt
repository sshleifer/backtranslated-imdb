Now, is not it? Considering all the good work done by Danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film has never become more than a terrible film to film. Yes, some jokes, without any unpredictable overthrow, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are because both the director and the publisher have made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why they dug a hole inside the vault, who the hell is Rebe, and how they knew on earth that the diamonds were in that cell could do my day, but it seems that Spike asks us take too many things in this regard and do not lift our eyebrows when something looks bad ... it's just another studio movie that relaxes and rejoices ...
