People like me will break this movie. She's not realistic. Plot is predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens convincingly. Of course, I find the treasure and become wealthy rich, and cheats the bad guy. I've seen it a million times before. The writers of this film must believe that most of the movie that goes in public is bad. He has to be right, because most people preferred this movie. I mean solving some riddles in seconds. The Secret Chamber of Treasures hidden under the subway in Manhattan? You would think about all the work done in New York underground. That room would have been discovered before. and all that was built during the civil war? Please, the love story between Ben and Abigail? how cute and I thought the romance of Clive Cussler's novels was weak. I just fall in love like this in 2 seconds WHEN I would be more concerned about saving my ass and winning them. damn the face and the bad paper. 1/10 garbage
