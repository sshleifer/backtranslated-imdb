This was a movie I could not wait to see! So I finally did and I was rather disappointed. For starters, the film said so little about New York, just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges, and cafes. Indeed, it does not focus on the magic of New York. Another thing that changed my mind was the French movie set inside this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! Anyway, here you will see elements that remind you of French films, such as long and messy scenes, do not talk too much and of course, everyone smokes the French style! The story comes after many lives (too many for my taste) and it seems they are related to the end. I feel like there was no dedication to characters as much as stories. The film was too short to cover each end of happiness of all fate. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have 120 minutes! if you like dialogs with active scenes and these things are not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I like New York and I liked the cast!
