I really liked a skilled horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played as a typical sequel. Everything about this - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an old man of the yellow hand tribe, does not look like an Indian or half of the other "Indians" played by Italian, Mexican, and Latino women with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the boss acted more like an angry old man than a fierce leader of the warriors. He even used the bow as a woman! Eventually, Richard Harris, who has done such a superb job in his original, seems to go away over time. I think he could not withstand the easy salary he had received to play his role as horses. To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as the horse suffering a painful purification ritual to "find its vision" and increase your yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but overall, the return is uneven, boring, horn and predictable - just like most sequelae.
