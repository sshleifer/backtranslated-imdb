This movie was weird ... I watched him while we had a quarter of psilocybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you have to look at it, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not help laughing ... maybe lsd would work. The film is a bunch of things that turn into other things and dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards, but when it was released it sure was fine ... Unique. I could see how someone might think this movie was good, but I do not think it was very interesting and that I was on the mushroom at that time. If you have a party or something, and everyone is kind enough, you can make some laugh.
