Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this movement, but in a small part. He is NOT the "obsessed movie" - he is the group's business manager / accountant. Even the box describes the movie incorrectly. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as they are published, unless the term "erotic" is used quite a bit. I would not have considered viewing the film without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a major character. But he might have realized that the hymn of the famous 60, "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen, was an artistic influence. In addition to the short recitation of the lines at the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and an interesting visual reference at the end of Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal", it seemed to me a weak attempt to combine the symbolic elements and the arrangements immortalized in "Last year at Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric artistic band, there are many great movies, from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
