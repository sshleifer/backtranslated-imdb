It's a terrible vehicle for George Sanders, where he goes from being a thief to the czar policeman. While Sanders was an excellent character actor, he was certainly not a leading man and this film proves this. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely beyond foolishness. Gene Lockhart offered a comic relief until a moment of rage led him to shoot his weapon with a resulting tragedy. Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After you have made such a regrettable movie, it's not shocking. Signe Hasso is usually nothing here.
