I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a small part in it and her character is not very pleasant. However, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is extremely beautiful and a perfect pleasure to watch the whole movie. This is nothing more than a showcase for her appearance and talent. She does a very good job. The story itself is quite absurd on her face. After a car accident, some friends are possibly dead, but they continue to live their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we never know who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we certainly do not hear anything about why they are after). Final scenes seem particularly ambitious from the cinematic point of view but can not get anything coherent from it. The opening scene, in which the bad boys (wearing strange masks) cut the wrist of a blond girl and gathered some blood that had never been explained or followed. Unless the bad boys should be a representation of the surgeons who are trying to get Cassie again (Sagemiller) ... but no, that does not seem to work. Bad guys are just bad guys; they really mess up a story that would otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story of death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys? 3 out of 10.
