The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Trophies runs at a slow pace, leaving Johnny Rico to leave his parents, a girl (not very attractive) he wants and join the infantry mob. The strangers in the show are nothing like the barbarian bugs in the film, but the monsters like the calamaries that shoot the lasers in the mouth. Along the pursuit of this version, I was always amazed at how frustrated they were doing everything. The show is especially about the relationships between recruits and the painful and prolonged looks that they give each other through the combat weapons viewers with synthetic pop 80, sometimes coming * during * the rare battle sequences that have turned into the last a few episodes. In terms of construction, it is due to a debt to Top Gun, which shares much in terms of rhythm and content (and everything that implies).
