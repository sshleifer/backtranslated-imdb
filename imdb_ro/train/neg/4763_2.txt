The main reason for writing this review is that I found this "review" of a 1972 extraordinary and worthy movie, a horrible cinematic experience. If I can save someone to follow him, I will do a good thing. This "new" version is loaded with talent and everything goes well. Kenneth Branagh OKs a nasty, sterile set, a note. He continues to film the film from all artistic angles, distracting himself, focusing on himself. We see reflections of the stainless steel actors on the security screens, the catches of their head from 200 ft above, the eyes, the men, and beyond. The script, by a Nobel laureate, introduces long stretches of unpleasant homosexual banter, which is falsified on both sides ... I think? Given the character of "twists," how could I know? The characters themselves, so rich, so original and insensitive. Running time has been reduced by an hour, which is either the real problem or the best thing the director has done for us. Actors perform their lines effectively, but none of what they say or do is trustworthy from a distance. Jude Law is overhead more than Caine, but as a creator, he must have had Branagh's blessing. On the whole, it seemed to me to be a nasty thing to look at, an unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it really done ??? The paying public has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A piece of vanity that fails every turn.
