The story from the beginning is interesting: slavery in (the end of) the 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem he faces is that he deliberately criticizes two of his favorite enemies by director Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arab men are free to walk around and easily grasp blacks in West Africa is as credible as whites who hunt slaves in "roots". Obviously, both transactions are / were led by locals and involve (d) far more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicated in today's children and sex trade, Israel is one of the worst rapists, according to Amnesty International. So why should you just show Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? There is an obvious tendency and hatred of these people by a Jewish director. The actor is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
