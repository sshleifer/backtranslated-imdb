This movie is a waste of film stock. Do you think the map of a military mission plan would be put on a easel on a daytime terrace for anyone with a binocular or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this movie. Do you think that a DEAF person would actually have been enrolled in the active army in Europe during the Second World War to serve in a "black" unit ... cooking, supply services, funeral details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you think a black (and intelligently assumed) officer will select the same DEAF K.P. is it part of an active combat mission to protect a barrage against the destruction by the Germans before the coming of the allies? It happened in this movie. Would you have been surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and that he would have killed and killed him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers holding a barn on a farm that the Germans had greeted him would put their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were only 50 years old? They did it in this film and left all the possible entrances to the barn that the Germans could check completely unprotected. Do you think that over the waves of air and in plain English language, the captain mentioned the rank of general, if not his name as the person he spoke with, and that the general, in the simple language of open language, said that the dam must be protected by the second day? Maybe he should just send an emissary to say where the US attack would be, just to make the Germans a little easier. This so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 films. If it were, I think it would be good. Look at your own risk.
