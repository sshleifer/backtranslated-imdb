This is another movie that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cats who kill to live, etc. - a sort of vampire concept. The thing that makes everything fall apart is the total impudence of the main characters. Even sociopaths know you have to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took her to catch Unibomber, and that's because a family member figured it out. baby (and to a lesser extent, mother) behave as if it were untouchable. The child kills without thinking that he has left no evidence or a live trail or witness. The way these people have managed to stay alive and undetected for a month is unbelievable, let alone decades or centuries. It is indeed a shame - it would have been much more if it had been plausibly written, giving the main characters the level of common sense they should have received for so long. Besides, it did not look bad. I liked the bits at the end where every cat in the city is converted into the house - every time I put food on the porch and saw the cats from time to time, where they were before, I think of that scene.
