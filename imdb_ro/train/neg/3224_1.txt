When I was a kid, I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "uncle" Phil. We returned! The story of the dinosaur is a cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex (expressed by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a boy dinosaur the story of how dinosaurs have returned to Earth to live. He explains it is part of the thing that brought them back with some friends. The wicked doctor / professor of this film thinks he would have been responsible for being back, but I do not care about him. Kids may like this, but personally it's just too cheese. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Weak!
