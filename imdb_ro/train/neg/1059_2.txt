I watched this movie last night and I'm already struggling to remember a lot about it. The story is about a group of criminals escaping from a space space colony. They fly to the moon in a vintage garbage carrier; when there, they terrorize the garbage man who works on the Moonbase. He realized that films with a low-budget scientific sculptor often involve desert planets or, like this film, criminals escaping criminal colonies. Why do not I know that. But I can say with certain certainty that such films are always diabolical. This is not really an exception. It starts reasonably with a decent credit score and a half-way dance music soundtrack. Then degenerate into a boring sci-fi thriller. So little is happening in this movie, that I literally strive to write a useful review, so if you read this, I apologize for not being able to illuminate the subtleties and nuances of the film. In memory, I remember a bunch of bad guys, a bunch of crushing things, some nuclear warheads, and a naked hologram hologram. Besides, I fight. If you feel you might be interested in the activities of the people of the trash can on a monthly basis, then I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
