There is a big mistake with this image, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic artist who escapes into a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately watched by a native who seems rather unhappy (Craig Sheffer) and who seems to try a third-rate imitation Mickey Rourke. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman who is supposed to protect and serve him. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience about who is really the good guy? Logic flies through the window after the first ten minutes, and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think the "blue desert" might be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
