This movie was not terrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old. The book is great and does not believe a child has written it. Toni Collette plays the role of a child tutor, whom you do not know if this child exists or does everything. I will not ruin the movie, but I will say the film is not scary. The actress is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was great as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a great disappointment in my opinion, I would expect it to come on DVD.
