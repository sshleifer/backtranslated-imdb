I just saw this movie (especially because Brady Corbet is in it) and I have to say I was not happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a small touch. I also think this movie would have done a lot better with more curses and blood, as well as if the PG-13 was rated. <br /> <br /> That would surely attract more people to see it -> adolescents. What would also attract more adolescents (especially adolescent girls) would be a big shutdown of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even if the movie had points down, I still saw it and I thought it was good!
