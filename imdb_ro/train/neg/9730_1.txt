Now, I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He's an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in all ... except for the movie. And I think it was just because he realized how bad this movie was and did not bother with good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines cracked me. And they have a few lines that make no sense, and it seems Tobe Hooper throws up lines without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW plot is BAD! But one of those films that is TAHT BAD, who is even a PRAYER to look at her. I recommend this to BIG Dourid fans or fans of any other actor because the intrigue is pathetic.
