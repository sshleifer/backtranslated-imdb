I jumped to the chance to see this unclear and uninterrupted film, remembering his rahs and raves for him. But whenever he seemed to be really scary, he turned and went somewhere else. The water that drips all over the country, the black rain, the prophetic dreams that took it in the wrong direction in the sewer, were left before they could make a scream. What a disappointment. Chamberlain's Chamberlain offered a small but confused mistrust, something I thought was mirroring as the movie was worn. What could have been strange to sing in aborigines and instruments in the background was instead a cacophony apparently designed to face terror in his head. Ideas modern people can incorporate the ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe that red-haired whites were the first priests and many other possibilities are transmitted more like a shopping list than a suggestion of another dimension (Dreamtime). <br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final stage, it was not clear to me what the director was trying to do. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yes, OK. It is devastating but not apocalyptic. Is the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? It should have been a big wave. Why? Was the world so bad? It did not seem so terrible in this movie. Actually, I do not think the tide broke out, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been thrown away. Was it just Burton's apocalypse? Heck, what happens every day to people who lose it. It was not at all interesting if it was him alone. The most frightening scene and one that gives the best clues to Weir's potential was in Charlie's apartment, where Burton went to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie asks, "Who are you?" and it really gets disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the movie never followed the example.
