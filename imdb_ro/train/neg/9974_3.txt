I have to admit that I got it a few times on the US network. There is just something about the stupidity of this nonsense, which makes me want to see it whenever it is. Yes, you are right about the sub-par share, the plot that only seven years may want, etc. But I can not help to feel compassion for some actors. Then, some of these actors signed up for more and more careful follow-up.
