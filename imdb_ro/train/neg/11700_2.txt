He was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after seeing her I was really disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Rober John Berk can not save his life and none of the others. Some shows made me laugh aloud! The movie was not the way I imagined, after reading the book that was wonderful, I imagined it was darker and more frightening. If I were Stephen, I would be very crazy! I do not know why they changed the end, I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just found the pie killed your daughter, would not you have fed it with no one else? The book was much better!
