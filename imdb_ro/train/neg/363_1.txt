what ends in killing this film is self-awareness, among others. Here is a short list: 1. Irreverent behavior. when battles came and injected their mark of "strange, irreverent behavior" / humor, it was welcomed as fresh. which was over 4 decades ago. get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. False sophistication. sharing the base, quasi-socio-political associations are hard to do comic work. ask allen. <br /> <br /> 3. Postmodern "I'm hard on this false world and yes, I recognize it myself", the snake eats alone - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - It's a retreat. <br /> <br /> 4. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur, writing, acting, directions ... have you ever seen student movies? a victim of herself, the only thing I can say positively is that at least she has a sense of self and heesh now catches me in the self-reflective work it deserves, worthwhile. br /> <br /> But to ... what? Finally, it just sounds like a blank like any other pretentious piece - hey, ever see Woody Allen takes bergman, namely: "Interiors" ??? well, that's more amateur.
