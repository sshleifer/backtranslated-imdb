The type flick-type who wants the girl, the guy who will lie to get next to the girl, the guy who will get the best friend to help in the outrageous (comedus reliefus, right?), To help cheat girl, etc. This was made to death, and with a rare exception of a few z-rated excursions, it got better. Stay aside, the pipes are attractive and there are some good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better and his actor came close to being called. It's not a complete loss, but nothing new in this hot deal.
