After being a big fan of ten-minute T.V episodes in "Stella Street," I waited for the movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I was left feeling very disappointed. I was amazed that almost all of the gags and lining were erected directly from the TV episodes and were delivered with much less enthusiasm and timing if actors would once told them and could not be bothered to tell them again. I bought my copy on DVD and I was mistaken that I broke up with my hard earned money to follow the same jokes again. The movie begins with Stella Street (a common English language street in Surrey), being gradually populated by "some of the most famous people on stage and screen for the past forty years", including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All celebrities on the street end up being fired from their entire fortune by a local sucker and are forced to live as regular tramps and people of the working class. There are some beautiful moments, but as a whole, the writers manage to get an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. * END OF SPOILERS * In T.V. Episodes, all characters are interpreted by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including females), but Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her impersonations were not funny and she felt as if her characters were included in the story just to offer him something to do. If you were not a fan of the Stella Street episodes, this fun movie. But if you were a fan, I think you can go to feel a little cheated. 4/10
