A modern version (sensually keeping it hip) reinvigorates Dracula's story (although it remains with the usual traditions) with a fairly interesting, if not completely fiery story of the prince of darkness. The first time I tried to see him, I could only do it halfway before losing my interest. Again, start with a good start (especially the scenes with thieves and then Dracula meetings), but for me it was less involved when it hit New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite the engraving of a damn paradise, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, throws this name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. From an artistic point of view, he had his moments with some visual images, but some kinetic editions and cheap jolts do not help. The disordered script is pretty stupid. Lussier does a polished work that remains rather glassy, ​​introduces a lot of blood (make-up is done properly) and a lot of "Virgin" advertising. I do not mean virgins, it's the music company, as is the case in many photos, and Helsing's daughter works there. Oh, it was not obvious planting. The soundtrack is a funny choice of rock songs. Now, performances are everywhere in the store, but there are few familiar faces on the scene (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just did not come out because there was not too much presence. He was simply brilliant by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectable. Christopher Plummer gives a grizzled turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with his role.
