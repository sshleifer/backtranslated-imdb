Like so many media experiments, this amateur effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5 years since it was launched, the premise was made less aggressive by real-world software development events and it seemed less boring to me than the previous commentator for this reason, I imagine ... The director is clearly a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the movie was not done better, but it's almost like a fiction of the pulp, including the soundtrack that we groped when we need to pay attention. You can see almost all exclamation points and large letters on a yellow page. I have to admit that I found it quite fun for all these reasons and more. Sometimes slick gave us less and I would recommend anyone interested in deconstruction for educational purposes. Oh yes - and even if the seams showed and they squeaked a lot, the heart rhythm increased, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
