This is the kind of film we look at in unlucky silence, thick, and yet we continue to look, fascinated, as if pursuing a slow wagon of the train. And yet, in the bottom of your mind, the thoughts move, "Who on EARTH lit the garbage green?" Some of the previous users' comments say things like "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - an insult to children everywhere. Children would need a kind of training plan to learn to love the slapstick comedy that shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others commented on the faithfulness of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy that I would answer: So what? It might be thought that the BOMBS eruption based on the beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are a few things that simply can not be recreated. Laurel and Hardy's films are easily accessible on the video: why bother with this? As for Murray Abraham, a scene and screen actor ... well, all I can say is he must have been in trouble with the IRS. Run, do not walk away from the TV if this garbage flashes!
