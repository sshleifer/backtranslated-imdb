This show smells. For parents, they usually want their children to see something good for them. It's usually educational, fun and bright. Is it educational? No, Dudlebopii sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to learn anything. It's funny? Not. Instead, Doodlebops say something that is not intended as a joke and laughs at her. Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As for color, everything is extremely bright, so it's good. But Nothing is ever wrong in the world of Doodlebop. Therefore, they are always happy. a child in trouble will become depressed because he has never been exposed to being sad. The show is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is declared at the highest level of exaggeration and very horn. It's too much. For kids, it's fun, but after 2 years of age you will not want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow.
