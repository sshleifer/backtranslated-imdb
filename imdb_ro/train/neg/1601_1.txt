The stereotypical shipment of slasher shots comes down much shorter than supposedly. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby and, in fact, the entire cast is totally lost. Lemon jelly abounds, and each punch line is well telegraphed. How much a lining is happening at a fast pace and almost every one collapses like a scraped grape. Musical numbers only contribute to boredom that installs and persists for the whole movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and look for one of Lampoon's really funny films, such as the "National Gold Lighters" - MERK
