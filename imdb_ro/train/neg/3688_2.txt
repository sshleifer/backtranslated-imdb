As usual, I watched this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to put an end to his film career with this film, it would be a success. But, fortunately or unfortunately, the film was a failure. After that he gave a hit with Chandramukhi. I look forward to Shivaji's future. I have read other users' comments about Rajni. I found it interesting that the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who, I think, is not from his mind in his heart. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we have to appreciate Rajni for his strength at his age. <br /> <br /> Any way, you have to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so you want u luck Rajni ...... .....
