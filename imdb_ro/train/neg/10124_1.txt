there is no suspense in this series! When an episode ends, the action is so inappropriate, the effects are so poor, and the script is so terrible that the last thing you have in mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing in your mind is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I do not see how it has ever been done, not to mention released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not in line with contemporary Batman movies, but even the script is terrible. An incoherent mess about some bad teachers and a ray gun or something like that, I'm not sure, because it's too awful to follow her. Look at the 60's version, or 90 versions, or even Batman Begins, just nothing over this version!
