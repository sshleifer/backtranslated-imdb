HAH! So this is the movie that "The Next Star of Action" met. Well, I'm glad I did not participate and I did not win ... It's not funny how we can look at the first 10 seconds (!) And do we make our minds about a movie? Really, come back! Look at these titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for television and I could not bear to see it all) one evening while doing my military service, and the audience with me was typical guys who, once in a while she looked at the Las Vegas series just for the girls in the show. so the bar was not really great, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and not because of the great scenario, D. But the total lack of originality, act, scripting and almost everything else that does a good movie made it easy to pass the channel to Las Vegas (or was CIS? I do not remember ...) without any complaint from the rest of the group And that's rare (!) For heaven Try to make a because Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action movies there (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to name them) I can only say that the producers do not give the film the quality, give money to the directors. sells this movie just because it's a movie Joel Silver is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious defects the crew that really did.
