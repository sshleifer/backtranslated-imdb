It acts as a satire during the era of women's rights movement. Of course, that does not mean that COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to watch. It runs in the same direction as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tainted) and is basically a standard roasting fluff. What I mean is that this film is uninteresting is simply recognizable. Anyone who serves time away from an ordinary job, forming a bunch of madmen, who wins their way to the sudden victory, makes waste. It's the same feeling you can get after watching this. A pleasant attempt to throw the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I was expecting better things.
