Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this movie is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bruce Lee died as a result of the fall of a helicopter after he was hit by a kind of ninja knife on the back of his neck, but he does not explain how he arrived with a helicopter since the previous scene is approaching him but not on the helicopter already at 200 feet in the air. It has just become absurd ever since, like something in a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not so rotten, but it is not made with any art from the point of view of the film. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding plausible stories in his films and film makers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are far better than 90% of the martial arts junk movies made in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. "Game of Death II" falls into the category of junk cinema, in my opinion, despite the fact that Bruce Lee is in it.
