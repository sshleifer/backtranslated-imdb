Wow, not only is this movie a "really bad lesson" lesson, but a lesson in the "bad movie". Do not get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of "Zombie '90: Pestilence Extreme," but at the same time we have to realize when a movie is terrible. If you lost the story, the Zombie 90 plot is a government plane carrying toxic chemicals, which happens to collapse in the wilderness, causing the leakage of chemicals, turning locals into killed zombies. The next thing you know is that zombies are everywhere in town, eating people alive, while a naked doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the illness that makes these people go eat one another - this is called "Pestilence Extreme". Since then, all we have seen is that the zombies have a field day on every spot in the viewpoint - nothing but extreme and ill-destroying destruction and discomfort, accompanied by gut and gore buckets. Because this is a German film, the film had to be called in English, and when you do not laugh at the nourishing frenzy of the zombies, the voices are quite hilarious and fun. As the UnratedX user mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman wearing her child is wheeling around her in his wheelchair with a guy and a horde of zombies coming out of nowhere and attacking them. A zombie takes the baby and tears him into pieces, eats the organs as he hears the baby crying. Wow, this is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY. Atrocious tell you, atrocious.
