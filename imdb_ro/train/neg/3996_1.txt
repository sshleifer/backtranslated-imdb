I do not see what everyone liked about this movie. The setting was too long and talky, and when it was made, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he was in the first scene. After the movie brought Cusack to the hotel room, I had to wonder what would happen here for the next hour to keep me hired. The answer: Not too much, only John Cusack having a long mental breakdown, traced. Perhaps if the Cusack character had more depth. . maybe if his anger was a deeper review of his daily life. . . perhaps if the film had better developed the half-baked themes of loss and faith or would not have attacked them first. . . perhaps if the film had made a choice either for psychological horror or horror-filled emotion and would have fully embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror lovers and nobody liked us so much. With the exception of the restless episode on the edge of the hotel, the alarming, crazy lady with the hammer and the so-called shepherd encrypted in the air channel, all three representing no more than five minutes of screen, this movie was a cellar. By the way, this story seems to steal the ideas from The Shining and use them here for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
