This documentary film is based on incomplete evidence considerations, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps deliberately, does not mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: his claims to the invalidity of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ do not take into account essential facts, such as: The existence of creeds formulated in Paul's letters. These beliefs suggest that most central claims about Jesus have already been formulated in statements of faith, possibly in a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** Testimonies of the early Christians can not be cast just as fancy. There are indeed many people who claim to be the Messiah during that time, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been absurd for someone to have believed that Christ is the moon and to die for those beliefs if they knew he was not resurrected. Even if the Gospels are dated more freely, we are still talking about Jesus' accounts written in the life of other eyewitnesses who would have shown inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that pushes various arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian vision. Do not be fooled by bad investigations.
