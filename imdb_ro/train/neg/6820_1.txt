This bad, implausible story is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hot police detective gives rise to almost audible lines that confirm our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had stopped from the bright power of A. Martinez's star in favor of this sad-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. The fact that a "hack-tor" on the street can not save such a cold water film is no less likely than a villain who carries a crime by throwing stones in a career for an unbelievable diver. His moment is short; His promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated for a long time on the screen by this obscure spectator, if there is ever a continuation of this bad movie.
