This movie is bad. I do not mean just "bad" as in; "The scenario was bad," or; "Working in that scene was bad" ..... I want to say badly that someone should be held criminally responsible for pushing this pile of steam cruelty to an impatient audience. I will not even deny it with an explanation of it (Plot?) If I can refer to her as this. I can only think of one more chance in a 40-year film watching that I found the need to spill a movie to me. I mean, after all, no one is going to deliberately make a bad movie, is it? Well, yes. Looks like I'm doing ... and the guilty person is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst is that Blockbusters actually rent out to their customers! Is recommended. Let the crap out there. Stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.
