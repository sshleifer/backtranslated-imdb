Wow! I am shocked to find that it is a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a 88-minute loss. John Dunne put it a lot better in a sentence. "No man is an island." The act was not bad. The children gave him everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow it, and the only "real" hero in the film gets to prison after being tormented by a maid. I do not know. I just do not understand. Good.
