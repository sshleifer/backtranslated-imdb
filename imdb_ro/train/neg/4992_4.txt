This movie is just another average action, but it could have been much better. When the guns came out, they needed help with choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in the heat as he moves the street out of the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the movie was well-predictable, but pursued - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the downcoming show, the one we were expecting, but it was like looking at something from A-Team in the 1980s. They shoot wildly, do not hit anything and beat around a house trying to kill one another - the same old, the same old.
