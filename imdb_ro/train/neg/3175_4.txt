"So, there is this bride, you see, and she is crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on her wedding day. Then you get that, a year later, her former fiance falls in love with a beautiful psychic? , that wonderful psychic becomes haunted by the ghost of the unhappy bridegroom who wants to keep her from the theft of his lover, he will be hilarious! " The policeman chick. This, I like to imagine, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed "over her dead body," introduced her concept to the executive studio there at New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how those same big business companies could come back and light up the project, allowing Lowell to direct the film and write the script. If you think no movie could possibly be as bad as this original premise sounds, then you clearly have another thought coming up. The only way he could have worked was whether the writer would have been simply crazy with him and turned it into a satirical farce that does not oppose. Instead, wanting to make sure that he played a romantic, fuzzy, harmless and warm comedy, Lowell engages in half-boring at every step, reducing the absurdity of unusual conventionality. Indeed, "over her dead body" is so inefficient and unfortunate that it's hard to know exactly where Lowell thought she was going with her. Virtually every set-up, joke and gag visible in the film is flat-footed and badly executed, even the actors themselves aware of their difficulty. How else could explain the lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their different roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proven their talent in better vehicles in the past (what happens especially to Rudd). But Lowell and the studio have the certainty of doing something.
