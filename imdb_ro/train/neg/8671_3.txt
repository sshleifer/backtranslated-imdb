I watched this movie on March 21 this year. I have to say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". The plot is shaken. It's about Prabhat who lives with his father, his wife and his younger brother. The movie opens when she saves a bride. Anyway. Ashgard Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother. He does a plan by sending a few men. They come to a pretended school to be friends of Prabhats. Leave the baby. His father throws him out of the house. .He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him.Sunny offers good performance, Chunky was annoying at best, Naseerdun is wasted.Divya did well, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted but showed It was so sad that she had to kill her character. The girl was nice but it was annoying. The aldo did good. Alok did good. Kiran was right. Amrish and Gulshan have done well. The cinematic device is excellent both in India, Kenya.Script is weak but has some good dialogues. Also shoot. The music of the movie was good just liked a song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics were good. The other songs have been forgotten. Do not look at this. Rating-3/10
