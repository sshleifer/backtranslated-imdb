This movie is one of the most unintentional bad action films ever shot. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren, with a Japanese accent, is quite funny, but it really adds a mixture of friendship, an eccentric and a top-top character, a sub-interest of clinging interest and one of the heaviest endings of all time. you've done enough with the suicide remedy for people who enjoy their lives and, until watching the Showdown, they never thought about suicide with a blowtorch. I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia and not to females. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about the male parts of others and, in fact, before going to suicidal suffering, Brandon tells Dolphy: "If we fail, I want to tell you that you have the biggest one I've seen ever. "Now is that what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION movie no less? And would you like these to be your words? Later there is this gem: Dolph (about the villain): "I would like to cut some parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Man, you got a fix." <br /> <br /> As the guy pointed out at RuthlessReviews.com, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not respond," I have a fix? I have a fix? decided that his last words should target my privacy! I just wanted to cut her ears and nose, man. "This is a bad thing and great fun if you are someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentistry without novocain." It's about hair, great fun for the whole family!
