ALARMISTIC is so scriptical that you think of yourself why on earth made an actor next to David Arquette to agree with him. It has to be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without any humor, it's limited to the dull edge. It happens in a terrible conclusion, which seems to happen only because the director was bored and just wanted to end quickly to get home at dinner. Stay away!.
