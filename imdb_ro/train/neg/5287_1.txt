I have no idea why they made this version of "persuasion" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to make a lengthy version, but of course it had to be deleted a lot; Unfortunately, what reached the floor of the cutting room was a wonderful spirit and humor, leaving a movie that was just a melodrama rather than a funny exhibition of English manners and moods. Also, the characters were superficial and uninteresting. They had a poor Anne driving down the street after Captain Wentworth was a modern teenager (and if you happened to be a modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: running for a man like a woman in heat is NOT cold). This is a well-worshiped woman from the Napoleonic age, who would never have done it, and certainly not the heroine with levels of leveling. Some said they found this ridiculous ancient; my reaction was not laughter, but anger. The idea of ​​such corruption of an Austen work is under contempt. It was terrible.
