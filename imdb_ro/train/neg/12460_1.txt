I have given up on the point where George Clooney's character comes out of her mind. I was not squeamish - after spending an hour in this, I knew what I was feeling. To say that this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious, it would be to praise it too much! How did people manage to sit through this corner of a confusing, slow, depressing pseudo of a movie, not to mention an Oscar nomination? Clooney looked as bad as when I saw him watching. What was he thinking? Oh ... and what was with these subtitles? - I only had a DVD or if the original movie was done like that - the sentences left hanging in the air? The movie was pretty hard to follow without it. I'm sorry for the distribution that obviously did everything possible with the available material.
