This movie (along with Rinne) is precious stones amongst the stories of retreating the homage that has so far gone to horror films at "HorrorFest." And, yes, it is indeed a poor praise. Because there is not much worse in movies than the fuck who might think the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. And that's all you have with The Abandoned. This is a film that was almost entirely accomplished in the director's direction. Sure, it would have been nice if it had transferred the movie, but that happened in return. It's a very beautiful movie with a few real scars, but the last drum is strictly for the latte crowd that buries the movie maker.
