Wow, it could have been such a good movie, it starts with Brittany Daniels tied up, I'm thinking cold, we'll get a lightning back, but nothing, the movie starts again with the baby filming. This movie would have been better if it was not for acting. I mean, the action was mostly horrible. Although with the lines that weak actors had to do, I think they did everything they could ... But it still ruined my movie for me. The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills. The movie shoots to long for the alleged shocking conclusion. Overall, I saw worse low budget films, but given this was hype with the 8 films to die for that I was very disappointed. By the way, there have been some reviewers to say there is a gore and other things. I saw the same movie .. Well, this is 4 of the eight, and so far only one was a good one.
