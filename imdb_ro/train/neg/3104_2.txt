I made some comments about IMDb and this movie is unique in which I have never seen the whole movie. It was so terrible of bad and unfortunate that I could not stand by it - though I tried. The biggest problem with this movie Mel Brooks that I call the "Mel coefficient." In other words, the better your movie, the less you see it in the movie. Think about it - the Frankenstein producers and youngsters were great movies and he was barely in them. But, movies such as Life Stinks and Balls Space are full of Mel, and they are pretty pretty movies (yes, I did not like Spaces - but this is not the place to talk about). Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not think of a less funny subject than lack of shelter. This is just a comedic destroyer. Think, folks. FUNNIEST (?) The movie makes Mel make someone with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster! And that's funny in what way?
