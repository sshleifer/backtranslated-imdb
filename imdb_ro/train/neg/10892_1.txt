This movie is AWFUL! I do not even know where to start, I do not even speak, I can not describe how dreadful it is. The blood is primarily fluorescent, and the act is AWFUL! The only good part was the biker who saves the day. This movie was red, I do not see how it could get one vote so bad. Looks like it was made by high school students.
