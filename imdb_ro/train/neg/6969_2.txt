Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of BodySuckers" as it is known here in the UK was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man biting in a greenhouse by a mysterious toxic plant !!!! Man gets to the hospital, where this worm as a creature comes out of the mouth, of course this turns into this monster of insects and continues to go on the ramp! Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the movie, I realized it was boring, with a predictable pay story, non-interesting characters, cheap and inexpensive effects !!!! Horror fans do not need to watch this movie rarely, you will not lose too much confidence in me! I give this movie 2/10.
