I agree with most if not with Tom (Bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi Series is a great character study, combined with battle and sword enthusiasm. I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I think 14 were not released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi The Outlaw was disappointing. The story line was complicated and seemed to be a mixture of many of Zatoichi's previous lines of story. At one point, I was wondering if I saw a remake of a previous movie in Zatoichi. This film was disappointing because it began to depend on the effects (a head, worn limbs, blood) and less on the notion of Zatoichi. All of the previous films have been based on storytelling and action and have won a great success with no further effects. I just hope the rest of the Zatoichi films are NOT following the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film in his studio. I strongly recommend all the previous films Zatoichi - and I recommend them.
