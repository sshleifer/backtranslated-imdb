Honestly, who gave God the name of God a 8.1 rating? I think those who did or played in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie is shit! This film is nothing but an amateur film or possibly a student. I'm a fanatical movie and I've seen terrible movies, but there really was no redeeming here. Story and acting were the worst I've ever seen. Props, including the use of airsoft toy weapons with terrible special effects, if as bad as anything else. They're all in bad language in the movies, but F-Bomb has been abandoned in connection with every third word and I think we could have a winner for the greatest use of B-Bomb in any EVER movie. Also, the movie was shot using cheap cameras and not real movies. I would expect to receive awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations across the country, but it does not belong to a DVD. Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that it was a terrible loss of a free movie rental coupon. This is a precious time when you will never come back again. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning to me.
