The film is boring, characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. Almost when the action music begins, the most impressive stunt is running. Any voice is doubled with Mr. McGregor, or Steven plays too much and changes his voice. There is too much dialogue in this movie, and very badly acting on behalf of all. The film is an excellent sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The effect of changing the shape of the eyes on females dependent on the drug designer was decent. The main villain was a joke, and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through questioning, he would only cast random plots, such as (spoiler) "CTX (his designer's drug) will be in water supply," which is never approached in conclusion or even mentioned again in the film. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
