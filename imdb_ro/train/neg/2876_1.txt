I question the reason for the creators of this fictional account of BTK's motives. Are they trying to describe animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Does not he think the people involved in this monster suffer enough? What a blatant violation and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: What bothers you more, the slaughter or the human killings? They used real names of some victims ... this movie was hideous, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film have used this tragedy for their agenda! People need to wake up and rediscover the line!
