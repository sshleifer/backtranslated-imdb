What is this ? A low-budget sex comedy? However it perfectly describes the people of Spain. They might come up with a better idea, I mean, they do such movies in the 1960s and people like it! This is not a teenage comedy, not a family comedy (you can not let the 12-year-old watch two boys in bed kissing, he will not want to go to Spain anymore). This should be rated "R", because only 35+ seem to laugh looking: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like homosexuals (which is an important part of the movie). /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stay with drama! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
