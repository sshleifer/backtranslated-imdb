A scientist and his girlfriend are out driving when his speed is causing a car accident. He escapes unharmed, but is beheaded. He saves his head, brings him to his house and keeps him alive (!!!!). Then he continues to look for patterns and strips for the perfect body for the head. His awful assistant follows his head that starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection with a deformed monster held in the closet. As you can see, things are pretty stupid, but I've had some boldness for that. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this movie about 20 times each year (without exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoon TV - uncut. Seeing this on TV, it was great! Blood and explicit gore, along with a terrible monster and unpleasant sexploitation - who cares if it's okay? I see now that I realize how bad it really is. The actor is perfectly miserable, the production values ​​are non-existent, the scenario is bad enough and (besides the still quite disgusting gore) this is boring. There is also a slight fight between two women and a really great monster at the end. Add also one end that left tons of free heads. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of the exploitation film from the 1960s. On the other hand, its total garbage. In any case, it's not a good movie, it's a must-see (for once) for fans of horror and gore. Also, the laughter of the head is quite creepy. Remember the final credits that were wrong with TITLE (calling "HEAD that would not die")!
