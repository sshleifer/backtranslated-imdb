I will warn you here: I have chosen to believe those commentators who have said that it is not a film of action in the ordinary sense, but a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on this basis and you will be fine. <br /> <br /> I'm here to tell you they are wrong. Completely wrong. Well, not, not completely; it's very disappointing if you were looking for an action movie, they were right about it. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. Tom Beringer was not too bad, I think, not worse than usual; but what did he possess to throw Billy Zane into this? Was it a kind of dying wish on the part of the producers? One way to make their movie a guaranteed flop? In this case, it worked. If they actually aim for success, then why not throw someone who can act? Oh, and it could go for a writer who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. As someone who stood in this misery, believing that she will redeem shortly, I can assure you that she never did. Too bad, it could have been a good movie.
