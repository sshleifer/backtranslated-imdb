"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of high performance movies, sometimes worth mentioning and high points, but unfortunately they are crushed and drastically slowed down by a shadowy plot and very little interested in the audience. She calls Richard Widmark as a doctor who works in a mental institution whose life turns into a disorder due to family problems and a rather ridiculous and overwhelming conflict that seems to be of little importance. . Time for the institution to get new curtains for the windows of the library. An old man wants to put curtains over them, but many patients want to make their own. And in a way, this ridiculous and unintentional stray conflict breaks out at the point where lives are in danger and families are starting to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would take place between very young children. The question of the logic of the question and whether it really could happen is so massive that it asks if only a real madman could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the act. Widmark distribution is made up of other big actors, many of them nominated for the Academy Award and winners. And sometimes there is a moment in the movie that works brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid plot about window curtains. Unfortunately, there is too much doggone drapes and so the film slows down. Many of them are long and made from a point of view of the room, adhering to the slow pace and lack of interest. <br /> <br /> In a brief analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognizable film and it becomes obvious why for viewers practically as soon as it intrigue intrigue, it makes it pretty fast. It really does not sound too fun to look and I'm telling you it's not really fun to look.
