In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the evening of Halloween before going to a party. Meanwhile, they call the American pirates of the nightmare radio for fun and confess their most intimate fears. A serial killer, listening to their confessions, makes nightmares come true, killing each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange little budget movie that has a horrible start: without a previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were Friday, 13. Then the story goes to a bar, where seven friends celebrated Halloween. From this moment, the story has great potential, and the unknown distribution has a very reasonable performance, usually showing some beautiful breasts and bare bodies, as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the script does not offer either an explanation for the killing instinct and the reasons for Jane Toppan's medical treatment, giving the feeling that the budget ended before the filming was completed. With a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good budget movie. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
