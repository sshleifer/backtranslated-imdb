I totally worshiped the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited to hear that a book based on a book was underway. But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it because it did not catch what I liked about the book - Erica is ridiculously funny and the exciting way she looks at the world. Since the beginning of the movie, I realized that things were not the same as I imagined in the book. So, I just went for a walk. It was not that bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I imagined to be! I did not think she would smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays it, is hilarious! but unfortunately I'm a fan of the book (one of my favorite books over time) that I could not feel disappointed = P
