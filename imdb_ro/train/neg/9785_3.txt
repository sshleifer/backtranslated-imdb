This movie, for a special school, is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing is happening. You feel like you're in the classroom. A guy teaches a lot of young people who can not be good paint players. We never get to see that these subordinates are doing badly as the good player prepares them. They suddenly turn into good players through meditation. There are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other children. This could have had a "Bad News Bears" feeling (the original) because there was a girl on a team of all boys, but there was no sense to this movie at all. She has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after seeing her, it's not fun to pack, it's not fun to watch and it's just kind of ... there. Simple. Boring. Something you would follow after school before your chicken before the evening. As the day is long and it was a long, long day watching this movie.
