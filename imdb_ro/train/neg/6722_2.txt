Have you ever been through a movie and after everything is like a big "wtf!". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another direct action on feed video can be as soon as you watch or better, but you do not look at it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are quickly killed in this, now going to fast mercenaries to hire the duddy if the story is bad enough and the action sucks and which is the purpose of watching an action movie in the case in which the action blows? Robert Patrick in particular strikes a new low level in a sequence of action that makes him pull a machine gun while sitting on the hood of a school bus on the move. Co-star ambient Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Hylands (from TV Night TV fame).
