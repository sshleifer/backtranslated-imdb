Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their son, Alex, to spend a few days with her family on Savage Island, an island of her own. The couple are expected to solve their problems throughout the weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the ship, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of squatters on the hills lives on the island. Fool Peter smokes as he drives the truck in the night and stops the lighthouse to go out; however, he crosses the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he thinks he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as compensation for the lost son. The Young Family does not accept trade and initiates a deadly war between families. "Savage Island" is a very low budget movie with a bad screenplay, amateur cinema, but a surprisingly good action. The erroneous story is absolutely absurd and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how could two men leave two women with their child on their way during the night with the menacing family threat? The logical procedure will go straight to the mainland and bring the police force to save Peter. Then the Young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the mainland and on their home and friends and no one watches them? Peter calls Julia's sister Alex when he arrives at the boat. There are so many defects in this movement that I can spend more time on this subject. I think this movie was shot with a home video camera so horrible that the pictures are. Good distribution deserved better workmanship. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
