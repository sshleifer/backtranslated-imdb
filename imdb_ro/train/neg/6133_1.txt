Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot as a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game that assumes he's been hunted by a ninja group, but those ninjas will have no chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole, Gymkata is a bad movie, bad movie, atrocious act, God's terrible script, and truly incompetent direction make quality below human standards, but this movie is so terrible that it really becomes funny. I mean with dialogue, like, "I know I'm going to hide them!" or "Ha! through you!" add only to the value of the mock that Gymkata gets the most. Besides being (wisely), the only film that has the hero is a gymnast who finds things to change in the warmth of the moment.
