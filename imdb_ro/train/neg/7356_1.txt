He went into this movement, just as he started, on an afternoon when I was at home with a sign of a flu - otherwise I would have missed it. That would have been the best. I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and I thought this would be worth a look. It turned out to be somewhat, but only because it is one of the so terrible stories that fascinates them. Zoe McLellan has not much to recommend his talents, except for Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson's breast. Unfortunately, his way of acting - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis by comparison. The white nut case, owner's cat, and detained in his own home, as well as a bunch of doofus (including the young man's case) unfolding around a bio-plant and absurd conclusion. I have waited at least for a scene or element of plot that contains at least a minimum of realism, credibility, or capable of evoking a certain empathy / sympathy - but this proved to be in vain.
