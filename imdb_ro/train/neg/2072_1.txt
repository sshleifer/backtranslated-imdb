I hired this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie. I thought you really could not go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confusing and useless ... it seemed that every time the writer continued to throw garbage inside. Also, the writer continued to throw in the toilet a lot of humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love. It looks like it could have been so simple to draw a story from the super hero Fatal Attraction .. but I think not. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy that has been announced as being. You could not let your child see her and you were embarrassed to see a date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could have made a basic story around the high concept and cleaned up - the movie might have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> A serious loss of time. <br /> <br /> B
