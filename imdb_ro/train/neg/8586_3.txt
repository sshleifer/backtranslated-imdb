What a disappointment ... of course, the best of prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed, and the end result is just a collection of fixed, badly made pieces and amateur stuck together. There are numerous continuity errors that clearly contradict the original films, and the appearance of Darth Vader was treated so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is instead a strange weird thing that will be ridiculed by many years. I will not complain about the scary dialogue because it is Star Wars ... the three original films have had style, cult and feelings of crack, and the strange dialogue added a charm. Prequels have been superficial attempts to make more money, and this lack of love looks puzzling. Pretty disappointing.
