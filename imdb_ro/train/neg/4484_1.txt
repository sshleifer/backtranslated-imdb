As soon as I started to see posters and hear talk about this movie, I was immediately excited. The matrix was incredibly watched and I could not wait to see the second, especially after I started seeing other trailers for other movies. However, when I saw him, I left the theater very disappointed, just like many other theater actors with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there were simply too few of them. In the first film, constant battles were kept, but the second had a much (and much more unhappy) view of preaching. To sum up the plot, there were not many things to expect. The machines were dug to Zion with the intention of destroying it (not a spoiler, everyone saw it in advertisements). The dialogue of the film was absolutely terrible. If you are not a major psychologist, you probably will not understand most of what is said in the film and for that reason simply does not care. It has become somewhat romantic, with the presentation of events taking place in the lives and relationships between Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, for some sort of evil as in the first film, seemed to receive all religious information and preaching. Personally, I do not need to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious loss of my time and I do not think I can look at the first one. Constantly boring and dull dialogue and monologues, from almost every character, made me quickly lose interest in the film, and the small amount of good scenes of struggle pushed my edge, and the end of the film pushed me right away. What movie ends with "Being done"? How original is that people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers should have burned the night-cream oil to come with him. In conclusion, the movie was bad and this is the end of it.
