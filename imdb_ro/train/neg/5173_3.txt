When I saw this at a store, I thought it looked very good and original. Just like Wolfs Creek encounters the Texas massacre, and I'm only referring to the cost of three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not think that's worth it. It seemed like the directors - the "butcher brothers" could not decide if they wanted to make a kind of artistic horror or horror slash. It has been in a sadistic and fifteen minute hour, with all the characters that have a single dimension and you are not interested in less than what has happened to you, but try to make your audience care for the characters you have, have added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film that is perfectly honest was not necessary. The only good part was really the middle / end - I will not destroy it for you. But this was the only "good" part. Generally, a useless watch. It felt like a two-hour movie, but it was only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic movie, it does not bother you. If you want a slasher movie - do not get tired - The movie moves so slowly, nothing happens.
