I had to give this movie 1 because it is so bad, but you do not think I did not like to look, because I laughed and laughed and even had some questions. So half the time I laughed, half of the time I said "what the hell is going on?" or "why would anyone do that?" et cetera. I was most glad to see the terrible fog, the nude scene / fight / dialogue / nude scene of the 1980s, and the way the warrior swords revolted when riding their horses. And they are model effects (which should not be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand the guy I find in the cave, what the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I would try them and liked the movie as people like Ed Wood, I have no joy about what was supposed to be the movie , I look at him in my funny way. So do not let this distract you if you thought it was a action movie, it's, I just liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can make you think like losing your life by looking at it (which I've come to mind a few times). I think the best thing for most people is to drink some drinks, have some friends around and laugh at this movie. Maybe it's a little rough, but I do not think you rent it and you'll see it. Yo.
