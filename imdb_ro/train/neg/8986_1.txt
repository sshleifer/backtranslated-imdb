THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to exaggerate me about a movie, but this movie has upset my house! I have not finished the movie and I have to stop commenting how bad this movie is. There is NEVER how it is! As a consumer, do not spend your money on this movie. Wait until you get out on a cable channel or something. It's just TV worthy. I really love a movie, but this movie is awake! Over porn. Should have and X rating! A good plot, frontal nudity (if your boat floats), but HORRIBLE at the high school level acts. I do not know how this movie was distributed. (It must have been a contractual thing). Indeed, if you really like to watch good movies, do not waste your time with this. From one movie lover to another. YOU ARE GIVEN TO YOU! Let me also say, if you went through something like this, maybe you can refer to it and it will have something for you. In this case, I say that you are following it, you can take something from it, if you do not just see something that happened to someone else (it has therapeutic value).
