I've always felt that a good movie should have a plot. The film was missing one and I felt it would have been more effective with a plot. This was worse than the fact that it seemed to continue forever; I was anxious for the end to end. However, I just noticed it was only 123 minutes; I felt four hours. Not only is there no plot, but the film did not also have a notable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So do not you think this review of mine is from someone who only needs action. Actually, I hate most of today's action movies; it's just that this movie is all the way to the other side of the spectrum. There is not much happening in this movie. However, the scenery and the costumes were pleasant.
