It's not possible, honest, the worst movie I've ever seen. This did not make any sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no action, nothing. <br /> <br /> This is what I thought when I first saw it May 28, 2003 ** prudence, this is a spoiler alert. it's also a lot of me complaining about how bad the movie is ... ok so the movie starts and the characters are introduced but there is no explanation of character. as far as I knew the main character was new in this school, but it does not seem to be. it also appeared that he lived alone ... then that he was a favorite child ... then that his mother was an angry alcoholic who had lived with him yet. also, all his friends did not have parents and did not live by themselves. Now we are reaching a main plot, this crazy guy broke out of the crazy asylum and is in full swing. now our main character is obsessed with this type and deliberately focuses on it for the contingency of the movie. I think I must have lost a main plot element here, there was no REASON for the main character to get caught. if that's the reason, with no reason, why all his friends, who are skeptical about 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what he wants to do ... they're raving in school, blah blah blah, but wait a minute. .. Suddenly, everyone knows that the main character is running the "show" here, wait a second, did not say the madman specifically the main character NOT to do that? should have been anyway. jumped over ... the madman did not have to be crazy ... everyone said he was not crazy, but as the story goes on, he's very clear from his mind, but I thought the news people say that n u was ... hm ... now the movie is coming to an end. WHEN IS CLOSED? WHAT IS NAIBA AIIA? not only did not answer questions about the main character, but did not answer questions about the crazy guy. are these people in the same situation? if yes, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to do so. if not then, what is the point you say "that you are in two weeks." * <br /> <br /> * The end of things ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I thought then. which is pretty much what I'm thinking right now. is 6 months down, and if I can get him for free, he could give him another chance, but I doubt. I doubt very much.
