First of all, I would like to point out that I only know the show because of my younger sister, who always looked at her. It seems to me the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing fun about any of the "jokes," and the laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if it was filmed in front of a live audience. In this way, laughter would show how "unhappy" the show is. However, I agree to credit young talented actors. It hurts me, however, to think that they will look back at the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The exhibition is linked to the general voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why today's youth need to be so shouted is beyond me. That's all.
