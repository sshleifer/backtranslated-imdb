The shape of the film is that of a suspense shock. There are surprises, twists and turns, reversals and emotions. Sometimes this is really a movie "from the edge of the chair". But disappoints and disappoints severely. The villain of the piece is not credible; its character does not meet together. I refuse to "ruin" the film, but only to say that the character we meet at first can not be the one we see at the end. The second major disappointment of the film is that - ultimately, it becomes a bit more than a bloody film. There is a small qualitative difference between this film and one of the films "Friday 13". Not that every film has to be always tasteful, but this film does not drop gore occasionally. Although the movie features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to walk in steps.
