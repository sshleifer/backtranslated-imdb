The film is a gigantic load of pants. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad scenario. And his direction is as comono as it might be without him being sleepwalked throughout the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrelson, which I usually like when it's properly distributed. He plays the role of Walker, a homosexual man in D.C., who plays the social companion of the bored wives of the Washington elite. It could not have been more dimensional if it had been cut from a magazine and would have turned in front of the room on a stick. Its southern accent is that the "decayed" decrescendy version from the beginning to the end of each line it offers, as if the heat and humidity in its southern continent leaked out of every ounce of energy it has. It's monotonous. But that's not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to hurt a kind of Middle Eastern accent that is so embarrassing that he can barely send him the bad lines written for him. He is unable to change the river, despite the fact that he is German in real life and speaks several languages ​​- one of them being Italian! Is there a good reason to throw someone else, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From story, script, direct, work to camera, to performer performance, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only tolerable moments in this movie came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only the three have managed to make this film with their dignity in tact. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being trapped in a very bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could be good enough to redeem this series of endless defects. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
