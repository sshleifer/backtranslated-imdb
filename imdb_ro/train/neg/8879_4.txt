I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics in his favor. He does well here, being tough, but the direction is so bad, and pacing is so tiring that he never gets rid of the mark. The story starts well, though it makes me wonder how my wife can hang on. He's still bathing well and wearing things over time. The field of death is double. First of all, if we should take time when the characters spend a walk from one room to another or from one side of the house to another, they would eat about a third of the film. Add that to Robertson's character in bed in the blue light that looked confused, which could add another piece. I agree with those who say that a short half-hour would have made a decent film, though insignificant. The greatest weakness is just a complicated plot that, when everything is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I do not put spoilers, but when it's over, she does not think too much. I can come up with ten things without raising a sweat. It would have been better if it were a ghost story.
