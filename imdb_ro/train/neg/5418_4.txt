This film is like S.E. Hinton had written in the 1970s and Copola adapted to the screen in the early 1980s, and if Trueblood was actually a product, the results would have been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather bad-to-fun mediocrity. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I suppose it's an exact description. This was in the days of action films that used boys in the 1940s and 1930s and dressed them in greasy yarns or a more effeminate selection of band clothes and they fought for music for years. However, Ray is the only one who cares for his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he yells a lot), which he is forced to leave inexplicably behind in a station when, during running from the cops, and forced to serve time in the navy. Flashing forward to this day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who was part of street gangs, though in a band that was Ray's opponent and now the old scores have to be resolved violently (and again, policemen must be avoided and this time, a lady of honor defended in the sense of film action) before Ray can continue his life in a normal rhythm with his brother, Donny. For the most part, the film is ridiculous. For me, most of them are far too much, though not by Fahey or by Sherlyn Fenn playing the waitress she's friendship with. The tape boys and Lowe themselves seem to do quite a bit too hard as the rocks on the street in New York. However, larger closure is recycling the plot lines and perhaps a kind of film that has been well past its past as a product since 1989.
