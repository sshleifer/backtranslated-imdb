Warner Bros. has done a lot of headaches in the 1930s and most are fast, economical and very fun. I really like how the studio exploited the less charmed elements of our everyday life. This is one of Warner's few melodies, which simply does not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editorial of the newspaper that revives the story of a 20-year-old killer with tragic consequences. Robinson offers a lively performance but is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad action of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leadership really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during his dramatic scene, near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of Hollywood's pre-code. LeRoy's law is full of innovative visual touches, but can not overcome bad situations and unintentional amusement situations. Sol Polito's work is strong. Somehow, this piece of fun received an Oscar nomination for the best picture (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
