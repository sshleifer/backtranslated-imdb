This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I want to be able to travel back in time and do the following: 1) Find out where the movie "War Games-The Dead Code" was filmed 2) Watch the original war games with my current knowledge of the computer AND the eyes of a prize in 1983. 3) Enter the pentagon computer in the 1980s, with the knowledge and perspective learned and recalled. 4) Replicate WHOPPER to NUKE the DEAD CODE location minutes before the first day of filming 5) Turn around now, drink a beer and take Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "beat" the empty memory of the whole event , especially my original view of the Dead Code 6) Have another beer and watch war games 7) Be happy until the next evil remake of a GOOD 80 movie. 8) I forgot they killed Jar Jar. I'm not sure if she should travel in the future for that. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
