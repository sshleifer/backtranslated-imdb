I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from acting (the actors give the most lines directly to the camera) to shooting shots (all average or close-up photos ... did not have landscape frames and very few backs in the photos) were absolutely terrible. I tracked this over my spring break and it's very safe to say I feel I was kidnapped in 114 minutes of my vacation. It is not recommended by any stretching of imagination.
