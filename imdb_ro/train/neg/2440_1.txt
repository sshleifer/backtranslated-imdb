Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he also tried his films. But this incredible junk has ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the current career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who became a football wife, a television presenter and programmer. In fact, I saw this in a theater (almost empty) because I was a fan of Koen Wouters' band, Clouseau. I'm so sorry I was spending money on this. It looks inexpensive, it's a terrible story and it's done badly in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad that it's funny. I'm not one of them. I've just found an incredible amount of time and money.
