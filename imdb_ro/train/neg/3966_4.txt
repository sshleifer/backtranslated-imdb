Suddenly, I'm not a horrible connoisseur of my partner, but a good put together, a smart game is worth the time. My words, in short: The dialogue is often weak and sometimes incredible that comes from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Unbelievable. Story never caught fire. Writers have picked up jewelry from half a dozen mainstream movies cast in a teapot, made little effort, and tried to feed the sick who dig the resulting mess, al'dente. Long and short, while it was not absolutely terrible, it certainly was not worthy of absorbing one of my NetFlix rents.
