I really do not understand how anyone can give this disgusting movie more than a star ... How do you like such a retarded film, where all the scenes of animal abuse are real? I do not even want to imagine the painful pain that those living beings innocent and defenseless felt in those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "man" would torture them without any reason or just for the money? I tell you that the director is either mentally retarded or just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut his hands and burn in his life. It contains various horrible barbarian scenes that can cause shocks, especially sensitive persons and children: a real frog is skinned in life, the fish are sadistically thrown and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, the birds are thrown into the water ... This film is more than terrible; it must be the worst and most delayed film ever made, along with another, called the "Cannibal Holocaust" or something. I will never watch a movie directed by this monster heart. No one should waste time watching it, especially when there are many great movies out there in which all the scenes of animal abuse are organized. Fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural because it is the worst movie ever - so it was not successful. I hope this will cause the retarded director to understand that such unwarranted barbaric acts of cruelty and extreme violence in REAL animals will NEVER be praised and that he will stage all the scenes of animal abuse in the following films. I really believe that everyone is getting what I give! There will be a day when all "retarded and cruel" people will feel the same pain they have once caused others. However, this is probably my only "negative" review. I usually do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I could not shut up. I had to speak the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
