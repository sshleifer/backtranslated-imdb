Chesty Gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is an American-Mexican "Border Cop". He serves as the father of the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man in the imminent wedding. Savalas is tough, but Eddie Albert (as Moffat commander) may be tougher. Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances can be in flux. If you find the possibility of hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" that say rejection, you have to move away from the "Border". If not, you may not have a stomach for a "realistic" cow slaughter scene. Although not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) steals the show. <br /> <br /> ** Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
