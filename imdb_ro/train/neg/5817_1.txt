The most difficult thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotypical "white trash", the "plot" of the movie was hit from the beginning, and the worst feature of this film was the fact that the nudity was so obvious from the body doubles was fun. Regretfully, it was the only fun thing in the movie. Ms Jenkins would be better served if she would not use her life story in the future to "entertain people". It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the movie) is that my brother has taken the money for this stinker.
