The story is seen earlier, but it does not matter if you can figure out the right story. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on the script panel. At the same time, the cameraman spent too much time bending angles that did not match the movie's message. The funniest thing is, though, if you look at the movie site, you can read that it was intentional that the director chose to make the film with the wrong camera angles. Because he reminds us of hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with low camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star because the story is OK. It's a shame that Ti West did not spend much time revising his story. It's like the movie was more important than planning. Because you have a room does not mean you have to make a movie right away ... come. Everybody can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. So, a tip for Ti West is: Stop and tag what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has fallen on a storyboard. Surely you have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
