When I saw this "documentary," I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again. Even though Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main reason for the Yugoslav breakup, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" by Bogdanovici, whose name tells us he is Serbian and his film is far from objective. It's one of the sets of lies imposed by Milosevic's regime. All others are guilty only that the Serbs have been right and victims, even though most war criminals tried at The Hague are Serbs, even if the Serbs are the ones who committed genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all the independent nations recognized by the UN was avoided by Yugoslavia, because Serbs did not want to free the grip that nationalism put on the federal Yugoslav government, so that Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations to protect their interests. are interested in an objective documentary about the abolition of Yugoslavia, and the document actually led this is not the case. You should watch "Yugoslavia: The Death of a Nation," Made by Discovery Channel and BBC.
