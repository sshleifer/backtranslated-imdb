Like a huge fan or Cracker series, I waited 7 years for the next addition. This episode I'm afraid of not obeying the legend. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for the wedding of his daughters and engages in a murder investigation were a soldier, tormented by the back of his flash tour of duty in Northern Ireland, going into a snorting killing . What I did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way to be set up and how it is taken to the killer. It is all oily to be cherished. There are, however, some good back scenes in Northern Ireland that are filmed wonderfully.
