Since I started visiting this site and voted for movies, I never gave a movie a rating of 1. Even the "Dance! Workout with Barbie" bother received 2. There is a reason for that. <br /> <br /> Every time I think of what I think is a very bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "This movie is as bad as the horrible beast that sucks the soul that is "Theodore Rex"? "And I never managed to answer" yes ". I would give something to reason to know what the break said "Hey! Let's remake" Blade Runner "with Barney as Harrison Ford!" and decided it was a good idea to spend the time and money to hire her to shoot. Moreover, I want to know what kind of market they would sell if they were not videotaped. This is the rare monster: a too violent film for children and too crazy for adults. I would ask "what did they think?" but in this case, it could actually be redundant. However, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of the five or six crazy fans of "Howard the Duck" or if you are curious to see the biggest evil film of all time or you really want to punish yourself.
