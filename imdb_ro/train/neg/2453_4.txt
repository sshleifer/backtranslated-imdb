It could have given this movie a bigger rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy, but seeing the two of them next to each other, there is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many of the important scenes in the book are left behind, and character development is reduced. Animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that have been painted over, which we found distraction. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks in the middle of the story and has never been done. There are some good points - battle scenes are interesting to follow, and the dialogue follows the book almost in writing. Watch this if you hurry and you can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused, because of this version is very much missing. 4 out of 10.
