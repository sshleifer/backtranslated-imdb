I do not think they did this movie. Completely useless. The first movie was fine. But there was no need for a sequel, of course, not after a series of television that was already a sequel to the first film. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's absolutely simple. The banks do not meet, the action is paid, it's shot like a soap, it has no direction. The first movie had a good emotional column behind him. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple then, but in a way it worked and I could see the merit of the movie. But this time there is no line of coherent story. The characters are boring stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. A good thing: the Brazilian boy playing Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well distributed. This was their only moment of creative success on this film. I hear they have already shot a second TV series as a continuation of "Team Spirit 2", but please God, do not let them make a third installment of character ...
