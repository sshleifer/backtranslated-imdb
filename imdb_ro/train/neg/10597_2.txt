This movie was absolutely terrible. I can not think of a good thing about it. The plot holes were so big that you could drive a Hummer through them. The act was so amazing that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that means a lot! And the dialogue, What dialogue? Thinking I was a fan of the first (I use this comment freely, more like a guilty pleasure than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it to shout out loud! Nothing good can come out of this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad that you can not even watch it with a bunch of friends to have fun! This must be in the top five top films of all time. 2/10 because it is very hard for me to give a 1.
