This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first uses his brother when he is shot dead in a car. His brother then infects the other gang members. In some zombie scenes they are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they are running pretty fast which does not make much sense. The act is mediocre, but the story does not help the movie. Makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this movie is sure it was very limited. I think the movie could have been better done had the story been more original and with a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie hit, you do not see that.
