This game has (dis) the honor of being the first game I stopped playing right in the middle and felt like smashing in bits and then burning. Congratulations. The first and the last Tomb Raider I'll ever play I assure you. Plot: Just typing that word made me laugh. There is one. There is no character development. Finally we have a girl heroine who take care of itself, not a beeping * mary-sue, but unfortunately, dress like a slut and her breasts are huge. He had to attract the sexiest players you see. Anyway, all he does is go to the grave after the tomb draws things as it goes. Why does this, I have no idea. I had subtitles on and t.v. how hard I could and still did not understand. The development (or lack of) of her, of the two friends and of the * villains * was ridiculous. Also there will be levels that need to go through it, you do not give any hint about what to do next and you will be literally in most graves tedious hours trying to figure out what the hell are they have to do. There is an exchange (of two), especially with her on a motorcycle (believe me it is not fun) that you will be an HOUR for athletes with no point of rescue in sight. This means that you hit other boys Autoturist and trucks sold to you or you hit a tree you started an hour crossing. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * CK: You know lets make the levels really have no story, no character development, give no variety in the game, they mostly music from the long ears bleed levels and do not give any indication player for them to stay longer in one place instead of going on land nonexistent. <br /> <br /> A F * ck one: Those who sound like bang ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I concur. Who needs character development, plotting or playing without a game. Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem as if the player is extremely off. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Taci Todd. You are fired. <br /> <br /> Game: All it does is shoot. Of course he can overturn during SHOOTING, jump while SHOOTING or hit SHOOTING again. But flipping, jumping and kicking does not erase that everything he does in the end is SHOOTING. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: intro music is extremely beautiful. I like to listen to him. The music in the game goes from tolerable to the desire to cut off the ears. Visuals: Since this game was made in 2006, I expected the visual to throw me away. Well, I was blown, but definitely not in a good way. Bottom Line: This game is a less plot, no mess of character development, with a young woman, simply dressed (THANKFULLY) in the lead, going through boring graves for some boring motive (what could be not able to tell you) with an inimaginative shooting game. STAY FAR OUT FROM THIS B.S. !!!!!!!! She becomes two stars to have a woman who is not a little girl in distress (no matter how fast she was dressed she could be) and beautiful in music.
