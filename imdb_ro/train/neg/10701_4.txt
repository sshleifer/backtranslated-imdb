Winners harassed in London have a treasure hunt, with a young woman who inappropriately fixes her politician father married to a strong, independent woman who has never been in love. An early devotee vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, playing a similar aviatrix to Amelia Earhart, who was too involved to go to any man. Director (Dorothy Arzner) and screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously attributed to this project to get the feminine viewpoint, but why all the old clich√©s are kept intact like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the sympathetic, crying wife who goes to her bed when things are wrong, and the final scene of Hepburn is another bummer. A curious, but not a classic artifact for Kate observers. ** from ****
