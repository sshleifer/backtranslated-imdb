If you've seen very few movies, this could be an important one for you. If you've seen many movies, this is a joke. The actor of the real heroes is portrayed very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks and, most importantly, battle scenes are performed stupidly. The new characters, a good direction, would have done a better job, but since they contain all the Bollywood heroines / heroines, you can anticipate what is going to happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions that protray are terrible, mainly because I saw this actor in another 1,000 Hindi movies. It's supposed to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show up. There are times when you ask, you have thousands of army soldiers full of soldiers moving, and the Pakistans bombard them and none of the bombs hit them. Are the villains very bad at directing or did the director make them look stupid? There were only a few characters who acted very well, but, as far as plotting, action, it is badly straightened. This movie could have been short if they pulled out songs, flashbacks, stick to point.
