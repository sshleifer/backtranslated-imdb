This film is about a family trying to understand the death of their mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. The "Genova" terrain sounds promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes describing the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and tiring, completely failing to engage emotionally. The conclusion is very disappointing because it is not spectacular, it does not move or is emotional. I can safely say I'm disappointed and bored by "Genova" The only good thing about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. "Genova" can serve as an extensive tourist publicity for the city, but not as a movie to enjoy.
