Oh my God. Where do I start? The father is not close enough to be the father of the girl. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, he is in the room. In this movie, the favorite exclamation is "Jesus Christ!" Zombies are agile, fools and few and between them. The reasons are absolutely incomprehensible and there is no narrative. People "hurry" their destination in jeep-driven 3 MPH. The world seems to be just as normal, but these should be the end days. Breasts appear for the sake of breasts. Normally, such an approach would offer a ransom, but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in the breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog without a reason and a thin, orange blood that transforms the stomach. General and his phrase to "hang f ** k up!" is the only ransoming feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear they have done a decent job and committed suicide.
