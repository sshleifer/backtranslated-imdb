Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? Let me give you a choice; you can a) cut and wash it in the toilet or b) create a movie based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a tough futurist policeman, along with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms such as "I did not make trumpets" and beat raspberry on the basis that this is fun. So, you would choose the option that has more merit - washing the toilet. It must be seen as credible. I do not even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit into the "so bad - it's good" category. In fact, I'm on TV while I'm writing - and, while I was watching, I felt the need to come up with IMDb and record my disgust. Given that Jurassic Park was made a few years before, they think audiences would tolerate more a man dressed in a rubber suit? WG should simply have gone the damn consequences. All those involved will go to hell for this loss of criminal money. I do not have to write anymore - I'm about to implode.
