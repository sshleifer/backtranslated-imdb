I put this movie in the hotel room to entertain my kids the morning we left to go back home because I scattered all their toys. (Children do not like to look at "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old found a funny scene but told me the rest was "too bad." This is a FOUR year, good people. Anyone over the age of, for example, nine, will want to kill his TV, rather than let him play alone. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie is bad is like saying that the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words about how ridiculous and terrible this "movie" is really. The act is bad, the plot is bad, and the script is unpatentable. Since this should be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at the evil of the film makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with a strange fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun, as far as I know), but all the characters are terrible. I did not see a real old Laurel and Hardy movie, but I know it should be a lot better than that. What is the purpose of destroying a classic comic duel with ... that? Bottom line: derived trash. Avoid at all costs, unless you have a strange fetish by Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
