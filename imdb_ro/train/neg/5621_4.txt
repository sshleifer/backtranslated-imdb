I am an incorruptible skeptic and agnostic, waiting to enjoy this film. Having looked at it, though, I honestly believe I could have done a better documentary. His arguments seem to have only four false sources (despite being listed in credits on IMDb, I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), it is edited along with cruelty with amateur computer effects at bitter and does neither at least the slightest attempt to appear impartially. The narrative is permeated over time with an almost christian anti-Christian sentiment, destroying every possibility that the film really changes someone's mind, unlike to teach the choir (that is, me). Although there is an interesting discussion about Jesus' historicity, the film strikes an unbearable incursion when it begins to live a lot in the Christian school that the director assists as a child, an institution that would have shaken him from a psychological point of view as a day obsesses. Although the TGWWT obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity to make a clever comment on the highly controversial roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical religious documentation lying on the market, and this film could have helped fill the gap. Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this garbage, which ultimately seems to be a sort of therapeutic exercise for him. It is too bad that his Christian education has traumatized him, but he does not have to obey the audience of his resolution mechanism.
