One of Scorsese's most serious. An average thriller; the only thing we recommend is that De Niro play the psycho. The end is usually like that, that is, above the head, with yet another invincible, evil man immune to pain. I did not like the original of the 1960s, and this version was not an improvement. I have no idea why Scorsese hasted time for a remake. Then again, considering how bad her recent movies (I am referring to the Buddhist film and to all with her new favorite actress, the blond Di Caprio), this is not so bad by comparison. And thinking Spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been a lot worse.
