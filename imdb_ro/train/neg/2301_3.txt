does anyone think this show really helps some people or just grieves those who follow it? when I twist through the channels and go to the show, half to look at the morbid curiosity. I understand that Roberson is not everything together. what I do not know is whether his viewers are like him or if they are good people and I think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Roberson bed has a small consequence. he is an old man who thinks in an old way. the fear of the curse no longer has the same effects as it once did (thank God). now, if anybody please answer my question, I will escape the lightning for the rest of eternity.
