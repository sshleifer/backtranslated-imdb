I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We were so bombed with the advertising and Cat In The Hat stuff that we almost believe there must be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I had to give her a chance. I should have gone with my instincts. It was a piece of garbage in Hollywood. Again, proving that the ordinary person can be programmed to believe anything good, it must be good. Aside from the fact that the movie is about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with an eating scenario eaten. It is full of unsuccessful attempts of great humor and awful landscapes. It jumps all over the universe without destination or direction. It is then composed with, ............................ yes, I will say, BAD ACTING! I could not feel like I was watching the "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. The cat was destined to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning had no prize, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, without stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
