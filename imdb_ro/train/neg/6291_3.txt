Now, I recently had the pleasure of watching the hilarious Bachelor Party comedy, one of my favorite comedies, laughing until it just hurt a type of movie. So naturally I wanted to see the sequel hoping to have the same laugh, but instead, the "The Last Temptation" license is made by the American Pie, where it is devoid of taste and overcomes the purpose of the first film's hole. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it does not appear in every scene. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but this could have been a bit more original. The only thing I'm glad is that at least there are no old actors in the original in this movie, because it would have been scary or really stupid. Ron and Melinda are hired, after only Two months of meeting, everyone is opposed. Melinda has a rich family but is very pleased with Ron and Melinda's brother, Todd fears that Ron will take his job. So they're out on a weekend in Miami for a bachelor party, and Todd will make sure he catches Ron in a position that will make Melinda change his mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> 2: The Last Temptation has a couple laughing here and there, but everywhere fails to deliver what the first movie made. These guys, Ron's friends, were more frightened than their loved ones, except for Seth, it was kind of funny. The only nice characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, all the others become more or less on your nerves. Want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing just do not try to pretend to be a movie. Be careful at the initial baccalaureate party, this is the movie that will leave you in tears of laughter. <br /> 3/10
