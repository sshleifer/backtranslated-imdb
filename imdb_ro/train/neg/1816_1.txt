This movie is truly brilliant. She laughs in banality to shit at such a high rate that you do not even see a common sense and a common decency for humanity. But it does not stop there! This movie strikes the bottom of the barrel so hard that it returns to the point of absurd comedy: here is how Kor Beganutted Conan wannabe, with the abundance of his neck strut his swing swing stuff that is not tomorrow (and the way he made me surprise, I was really amazed there * it was a tomorrow for him, or at least for his beer intestine). Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic story through an idiot and a pure bloody mind! And once you've finished watching, leave tears of joy (or tears of frustration at such a story attempt) from your eyes, because some stupid men have given these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
