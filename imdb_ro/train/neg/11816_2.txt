It is lost in frozen space for 15 years, it is unlikely. Falling in a star ... unlikely. Getting down on it the day the supernova goes and explodes ... ridiculous. Saving a ship of that time ... priceless. No, it's not Heath of Gold from Zaphod Beeblebrox for rescue. It is also not the prize for the parents of the years. After sentencing her daughter to two years of isolation on an abandoned space ship, her mother encourages her to get drunk and to wander alone with the strange man they took. This prefigures their power in hand to fight the hand, which makes most of the action of the movie. Signs of combat include, for example, the psychopath who approaches face to face with a woman, blindly pointing blindly behind him to the other, about six inches in distance, which is obligatory in the line of fire. at the end of the year, the family of three abandoned the metropolitan-sized ship they intended to use to see the supernova until the last minute because it was too slow to escape the explosion waves instead of using the psychopathic fighter ship on which fed them in one minute with 1600 kilograms of gaseous fuel from a 0.7 kilotone rocket. You must love heavy scientific statistics! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant cat, they will continue to make movies that do not fit to run at 3am on Scifi channel.
