It was a terrible movie. It hurt to look at her. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the actor was very poor (P. Diddy was the best actor to really say something about the film), and the plot was generally predictable. Some ties to Carlito's Way were fine, for example, his dream of moving to Carribien someday, but generally weak. The interest of love from my point of view has been wrong, but hey is questionable. Anyway, I did not expect too much before watching the movie and I think you could even say that these expectations were not met. I feel sorry for Jay Hernandez because he is actually a decent night actor (Night Night Lights). He's lucky, though because I'm sure there will not be too many people watching this movie. Generally, I give movies a decent appreciation if I get my interest, so I'll go ahead and give it two stars. More luck next time. And yes, I liked Carlito's Way.
