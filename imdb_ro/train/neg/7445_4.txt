Extremely boring drama, starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who prepares a wild horse, Flicka of the title, and is the only reason to watch the movie first. Wrapped in music, arrogant music and weighted by a schmaltz dialogue, this is one of those endless movies that searches you to the end of a headache. The following "Thunderhead, Flicka's Son," in which McDowall prepares the next generation of nag, is a bit better than the original, but the rhythm remains sluggish and the score continues to push you now, though there are at least one or two scenes that do not induce a coma.
