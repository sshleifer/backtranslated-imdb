Original Claymation Rudolph: Very good. Original Cartoon Frosty: Requires a small job, but it could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on July 4? Come on! Save me !!! This was a movie that should not have been done. It was bad. It really did not really go on holiday especially with the exception of July 4th. That made it worse, because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be destroyed by singing too much. The frequent songs made this film look much more than it really was. The movie tried to mix two familiar Chirstmastime characters with a traditional American feast (which almost seems to "limit" it in America), too many unnecessary songs and an eager line. The outcome? An evil movie that can not really be watched at any time of the year. I would suggest giving up this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
