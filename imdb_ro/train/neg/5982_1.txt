I'm really sorry to say this, but "Thunderbirds" does not even come with a hard pop, no thunder. At one stage, we paid particular attention to getting out of the cinema, I was hoping for the hope that the movie could improve. I had to be disappointed, it did not improve, it got worse if possible. If I went to see the movie thinking it would be a "spoof", I would still be disappointed. They had the great opportunity to make an excellent movie franchise here, they totally missed this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have names attached to this film, and Jonathan Frakes, well, I can say that he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be far from the truth. I saw this movie on a pre-release show, I was expecting to see it most impatiently, growing in the 60's with the original shows. Saying that I was disappointed would be something to underestimate. One last thing I will say about the film was that puppets in TV shows were just a little more of wood than if the actors in the film.
