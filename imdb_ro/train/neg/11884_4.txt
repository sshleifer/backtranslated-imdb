The biggest joke in the world. The biggest joke in the world, the most exclusive in the world. Emulating the noisy humor and the "noise" of the office space, this film turns the attraction of this film into the earth making humor so that it is only appropriately appreciated by the legal secretaries who write books. The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then feel impressed by the horribly protagonist. The whole movie is centered on the legal secretary who finds free time, listening to music and writing a novel while you work. These are his goals. You can not imagine your palm in front of the audience when (around half way) finds it has a job that matches all three criteria, but then it gives UP! The director and screenwriter (Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth) completely eliminates the public's motivation to empathize or even find entertainment a protagonist who has previously dropped what he complains of his lack. a major obstacle, the insider's secret secret fails, because it must be explicitly explained to the public each time it happens. Without these asses, the audience would have noticed anything strange. Humor is effective only if there is no need to be thoroughly explained to the public what is fun.
