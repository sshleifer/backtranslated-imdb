I do not know what this film director is, Sam Mraovich, in a way embarrassed about any small aspect of this film. Normally, I would say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important of all times. This film should exist for the sole purpose of being undoubtedly "The Worst Movie ever Made". I have seen bad movies during my life, but this somehow destroys what I considered bad in something much harder to imagine. Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the funniest thing is that Mraovich himself thinks this is a great movie. Oh wow ...
