I find myself wondering what the people who gave this 10 saw that I did not. This movie has a very long duration of tracking and / or staying on a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's an impressive drama of 98% and a comedy of 2%. All actors turn into extraordinary performance that can not be denied, but it seems to have really lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and had to be written down or what. This had potential, and in fact it was a flop. I really would like the hour and half that I invested in this movie, but the movie rental will not come back in time. Save money and see something else.
