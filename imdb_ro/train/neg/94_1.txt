CHRONICLE ZOMBIE <br /> <br /> Appearance Report: 1.33: 1 (No-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While Looking a literal one in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) raises a grizzled autograph (Joseph Haggerty) telling him two stories about a zombie who eats flesh to haunt the area. <br /> <br /> A waste of ABSOLUTE time, hobbled from the start of Haggerty's painful amateur performance in a key role. Worse, the two stories that represent most of the running time are absolutely common, aggravated by the indifferent performance and blurred direction of Brad Sykes, who was previously responsible for CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a "fun" movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are "fun" (at least he believed in what he did and was sincere in his efforts, despite the lack of talent); Sykes' home movies are, in fact, aggravating, boring, and almost totally devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers will feel reasonably angry and befuddled by an unimaginable, poorly designed junk. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
