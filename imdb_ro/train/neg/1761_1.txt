First, I realize that the "1" rating should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie receives this from me because, as a commentator points out, it is not bad in a self-conscious way that might allow it to have a comic or a worship value. It simply loses its mark on every count. ** Includes possible spoilers ** Dialogue is completely disingenuous. Continuity is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel just finished talking about his lost love, and with his last word the flamenco dancers start. The shocking shock of her name (see, I do not even remember the name of her character, not to mention the name of the forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her boyfriend is the bad guy. The car and the tracking of the motorcycle have made all the right things. Vegetable trolleys flying. The cars crash into each other. Motorcycles down the stairs. People being almost hit, but remarkably, no one is. That's right ... except for the one who has been stabbed several times, it's obvious that he's hindering along the edge of the knife wound, and a car that's approaching does not seem to notice it there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is increasingly remarkable for me that movies like this can be made. There's so much pressure in the movie industry to make money, you think someone in Hollywood would think about making good movies worth seeing. Now it's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Do not see this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Do not watch him by wire. There are a lot of other things you can do, which will leave you feeling more satisfied.
