I watched the whole film, which recognized the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I'm glad I had no idea about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie I said, "Was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for remarkable performance. Weller played a major character and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. Generally, the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, apart from those of Nosbusch and Weller, were par. The scenery and the setting were interesting, and Weller was amazing. 4 stars, 10 each.
