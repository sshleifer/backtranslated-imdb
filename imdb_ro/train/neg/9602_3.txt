Daniella has some problems that happen outside. She starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (who resembles her) who was burned to be a werewolf. She goes a bit feral when she begs the excited men and cuts out their throats. She finally finds a man who helps them to shape their inner beast, but when others destroy their happiness, she pulls out her violent and gentle revenge. "Wrewolf Woman" is not a very strange movie, but it does not feature a good movie of the crowd. A time of fun could have been caused by harassment of the act of evil / duplication / translation and by the simple matter of production. But, on its own, it moves slowly, but it has a great nudity to just wake you up.
