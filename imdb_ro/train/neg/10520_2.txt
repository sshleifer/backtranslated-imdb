The angels who were lost have been banned from heaven and live now in a British forest, where they seduce and drive away teenagers. Talk about high concept. In addition, this little mother gives Tom Savini, but since the range of action is limited to two minutes of screen presence of five minutes seems like a long time. Angels run around the woods naked for most of the film, but, although they may have the body of an angel, their faces would look like Joan Rivers certainly a bad day. Mediocre effects and gore-goers and night scenes do not help remember the fatal film's famous Paris Hilton. So bad it's really bad.
