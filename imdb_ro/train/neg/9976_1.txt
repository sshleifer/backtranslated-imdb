The first scene in "Problem Child" has a baby on the face of a nun. For this movie, that's great. An ugly, moody "comedy" is ineffable on so many levels that it governs faith. John Ritter is the good father who adopts the child from hell, and he makes them retain their dignity in the attack of annoying shows and humorous humor. And what the hell Jack Warden is doing in this mess? Directed slowly by Dennis Dugan and inappropriate in his attempts to start sentimentality when dealing with cruelty, the movie is done so badly, it's a pretty bizarre experience. But it does not matter all this. The low light of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most reluctant and inappropriate actor who ever hit the screen? believe me, you want to beat him right in the mouth.
