Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic pornographic erotic pornography every night from 22:00 to 4:00 in the morning, but their "scare" factor is very limited if there is one. In fact, I'm sure I will find a lottery worth worth millions of pounds, much more scary than anything that can offer this channel. Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves a special mention because I feel like a minimal channel. I can not even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but to complete the 10 lines required by this site, I will give it at least. <br /> <br /> First, the title is deceptive and has no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact, the movie could be called the "toothbrush" or "wallpaper" for everything that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. There are blood hundreds of miles around and what's even worse, there are no dances, none. I'm sure they were doing two different films by mistake. A more appropriate title would have been: "The scary Italian count leads five people to a scary castle and haunts us for ninety minutes." Yes, which fits better. The actress is terrible and the awesome dubbing, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost as riding in wood as he was in his ... abisal character. /> <br /> The only rescue grab of this film is a small, but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sexual sex scenes, and the added attraction that each female character pulls out the set. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, direct a wide nation to this. No vampire, no dance, no scene of brutal or frightening nature, and no way on God's earth, I'll never see him again. No word of lie, this movie could put you shut pictures for life.
