Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America hit, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty shit, consisting of repeatedly clipped and glued clips from Season 2 and was described by his writer, Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just terrible." <br /> <br /> Why manufacturers could not just wait to pull something decent who knows. I think that because of the strike, the production was out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to vote for this half assertion. This episode also marks the final appearance of the series Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski).
