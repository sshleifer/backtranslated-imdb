First of all, I'd like to tell you that I'm in comics, anime, animation, and so on. It is true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I'll be objective. To start with the story - it's OK. Follow the story line of comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's certainly cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate anime style and kept original cartoon-style drawings. If we pretend you do not see the rare effects like fire and lightning, you could say that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D since 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, voice talent does nothing remarkable, music is nothing special. So, overall, it lacks the atmosphere. I looked at her, but I can not say I liked it very much. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. Perhaps it will be shocking for someone who has never pursued more adult-oriented animations and see for the first time animated blood (is anyone around?) But I do not think he is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spices to that. The puppies around Lucifer were pretty tasty and we have our Lady Death too! There are some sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. Overall, the movie is not that bad, but if you want to get the original version of Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Fire and Ice or Wizards from Ralph Bakshi. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
