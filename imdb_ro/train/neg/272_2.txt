When I was younger, I was very happy to see the bad TV. We were all guilty at one time or another, but my excuse to look at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is the following: I was young and naive; ignoring what makes a really useful show. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I now appreciate the good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. At the age of twelve, I would love every bully, every rigid line of dialogue, any unnecessary technobability. The writing is beyond insipid; so unwavering and unspoiled makes a miss of Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me spend a lot of time on the worst Trek show, you're in trouble. Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid shows by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score and cool SF ideas. Except for a small percentage of the original music, none of the fun of the film appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems to have slept half in most episodes. The budget must have been very low, because sets sometimes look like someone's basement. Cinema is not much better, as vanilla and boring as scenarios. It amazes me that much more style (like Farscape) and substance (like Battlestar Galactica reimaginate) have lower and lower fanbases than this pop. It simply is not worth it.
