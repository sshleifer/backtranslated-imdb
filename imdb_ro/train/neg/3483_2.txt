Surviving Christmas (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Made by his girlfriend, a handsome yuppie does not want to be left alone on Christmas, so he decides to go home to his boy, imposing on the dysfunctional family living now and bribing her as a family. Afflict's unpleasant and unidimensional performance, which mainly acts with a bright smile, makes his character disappear as a mentally unbalanced creep, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe a little in this mess. Even for the farce, his fright is something, it does not make much sense from scene to stage, and his sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's smile. 91 minutes, rated PG-13. * Â½
