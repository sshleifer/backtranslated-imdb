If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and like hand-held rooms you should love this movie. I liked the strange story (even though I feel like "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated film from "The English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It's not "on the water's edge" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by the European claim. But the worst part is by far the hand room. It's so fun and annoying that I wake up desperately waiting for the movie to end. I do not know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, your hand room will have nausea in about 10 minutes.
