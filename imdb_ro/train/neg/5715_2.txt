"Say Yes" is one of those blows that you always hope will improve, but it never happens. He is a kind of "heiressing psychopath who decides to endanger an innocent young man," so fond of the creators of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is steadfast and, in some places, poorly translated. The actor is equally poor, especially from the bastard of the play played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to believe that by not blinking or trying to speak deeply, he makes his character look threatening when everything he does really makes him look a little simpler. The plot is worth mentioning especially because it is idiotic beyond any faith. "Heroes" do not think it's too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. "Eroina" manages twice to miss seeing the bastard when it is no more than a meter away from her. The villain goes through a police control point (while wearing a blood-covered shirt and a bloody bandage), showing the cops a burned corpse in the passenger seat of the car he leads. The villain is perforated, hit with a shovel and caught by a fork, but never seems to be prevented from these serious injuries. And it does not even make me start with that terrible "twist" that ends. Sheesh. The only plus point in this movie for me is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very cute but really is just a mediocre actress. Generally, this movie comes as a badly written, flawed and shocked attempt to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos," but fails every round because of the lack of talent to all involved.
