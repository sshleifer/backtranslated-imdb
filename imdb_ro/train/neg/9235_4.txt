This woman no longer tries to speak throughout the movie. She memorized every line and released everything without natural emotion. It also has a most unpleasant cup, and the color of her voice sounds like her nails on a blackboard. This movie has too much Betsy Drake, and it's not enough Cary Grant who wore what's left out of the movie entirely on his own.
