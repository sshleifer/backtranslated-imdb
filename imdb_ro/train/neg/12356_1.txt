Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go in the middle of the movie, but I opposed. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women are as bad as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in battle, and that is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Lybia? Is it still fighting with Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to think that Islamic people are always a danger?
