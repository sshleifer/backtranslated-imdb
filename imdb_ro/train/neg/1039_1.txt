This movie is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Please do a favor and avoid this incompetent training. Shaking your room and your actors <br /> <br /> Perverse adoption is not the "direction" that this film needed. Not that the writing was wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that artificial way (the "pseudo-documentary" style appreciated by those who do not know how to steer). <Br /> <br /> This movie gives the impression it has been cynical to appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about filming (which is the bulk of them). Just terrible. There's a lot to say about Sundance and what happened to Victor Vargas being presented there.
