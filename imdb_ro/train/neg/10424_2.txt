I should love this movie. the act is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie always seemed very cute. the film makes people in the working class look small and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above her has always made me a little anxious. Barbara Stanwyck, as a mother, worship her daughter, but her daughter lacks the desire for mothers to find happiness with her father's family. I wonder how many others who have seen this movie feel that way about it. the action was still very good and worth watching. I really do not like the story line. just a personal preference
