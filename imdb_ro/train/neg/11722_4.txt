The CONTRACTOR problem is summed up by the opening scene. The CIA wants an international terrorist to die to contact the black assassin, James Dial. The terrorist appears at Bailey's old courtyard in London, raising the question of why he wants to tear a terrorist if he spends the rest of his life in prison? Anyway, he'll get out of the way. CIA did not have a chance before being arrested? If, from a chance, he receives an innocent verdict, then he kills him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend their lives in a maximum security prison. Because the premise creates the story, an audience might be chosen to ignore the plot hole, but the assignment itself pours fire fuel. Dial's colleague is murdered by a police bullet and the taxi I drive in accidents, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were pretty close to shooting someone, but too far to hold someone from a car accident? The film of this plot plot plot. Subsequently, Dial finds a police inspector showing a gun at him saying "this airport is surrounded by armed coppers," but Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation. The whole movie deceives the audience, relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important support character called Emily Day. Why does he help Dial even if he is a wanted fugitive? Your opinion is as good as mine <br /> <br /> This is a rather poor thriller and do not get involved in the big name distribution. Wesley Snipes qualifies as a film star, but has killed his career by playing more and more unconscious movies. Charles Dance also appeared in Hollywood high production productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again he is best known for having appeared live on DVD these days, and in fact has a cameo role anyway. Lena Headey can become big players in cinema, but they certainly can not put CONTRACTER on their resume
