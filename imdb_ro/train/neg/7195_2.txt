Disney did it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that barely resembles the animated drawing on which it relies and does not preserve the spirit of the original. Inspector Gadget "was one of my favorite cartoon drawings when I was a young man and because a movie about his existence existed may have been a dream come true then. Now that that movie exists, I was very disappointed The gadget himself has the gadgets that have made him such a fun character in original cartoons (with specially developed special effects that accompany them), and even has some of the naivety of the original Gadget , but now she is more competent and is expected to solve the crime while Penny and Brain just follow. Penny has little to do, while she played a major role in cartoons, she discovered the crime and stopped it, and sometimes it was captured by MAD agents, now she's just introduced and then forgotten, though she at least sneaks at Claw's base. Claw is the movie version to Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister, abusive man, who wore metal gloves, and sat down with his face hidden from view as he stroked his cat and supervised various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, without any mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat are in the movie, but they are quite insignificant to him. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon are not spared in this butcher shop. The famous phrase "Wowsers!" has been mysteriously changed to "Wowser," and Gadget's Gadgetmobile now looks different and speaks. There are even testimonials about products everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" advertising on a sign? Why Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M or Skittles? Fans of the cartoon will hate it, others may find the movie below, and when everything is said and done, this film is another attempt to make some quick money from another old show.
