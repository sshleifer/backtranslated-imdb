you can tell that they spent $ 5 doing this. is a waste of time ... ugh .. there is nothing good about the distance about this movie ... .. I do not know why I kept watching .. the chicken is not hot. horrible, acting .. you could do anything and better use of your time .. like watching TV playing video shit .. I feel robbed. just robbed .. of my time. I never did a review for a movie before, as you probably know, but this movie I felt like I needed to save the poor souls who are about to watch it and look for IMDb before to see if her decent and look at the comments. - there was no action - it's not hot birds - no budget - -shittttttttttttttttty acting - screams a bad movie. **** The WHOLE movie is in a room. ***
