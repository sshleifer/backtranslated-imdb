This movie has some key flaws. The first and most important of these is the clear lack of a good plot! This makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also to see an observer feelings of hopelessness, as if it loses the precious time of short life. This means that the movie can not capture the audience, but it encourages the viewing audience to grow up the contempt for the movie and all that is associated with it! In short, it is really very very very very very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew a big rubber shoe, you will find it more exciting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
