Who? What the? Where? When? Why? The act was terrible. Very robotic, repeated. I've seen all the actors in this movie in better roles. The script was very elementary. By the end of this film, the story line has been linked. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should also be tied. So they never try to write / direct another movie.
