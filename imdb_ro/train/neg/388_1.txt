I can not stay with most of the reality shows and this is worse than the one with Paris Hilton and sure it is his company. But "are you fired" or "are you employed" for how many seasons now? After watching the show, I would not want to work for the guy with his ego and everything and I think seeing the dry paint has more entertainment valve. I would like to hear only one person and say, "Donald I gave up and takes some money and buy a decent basket." I see that even trying to buy fame in the WWE fight. I hope he hurts, so I do not have to see his pathetic face. You have to be sad to want your fame so bad and you do not have the talent and try your ass to buy it. It would give me a negative show if I could, but it gets 1 and it does not deserve it.
