There is no spoilers in this review because everything has already been shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in the magazine because I strongly support local films, but I can only support the reaction against this film. It is slow, boring and neighboring with uselessness. Even "near-sweet and credible" moments were immediately overwhelmed by painful clich√©s and bad action. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom they usually love, were only susceptible to this film. He felt the director tried to make a melodramatic TV soap, then went and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with a RA rating (Rated Awful) but have not changed their trust in local movies. More good movies will come as long as many movies like this are not done.
