My first complete Heston movie. The movie everyone knows so far. A Sci Fi Thriller. The factor campy. Everything that goes with this movie was injected into the head when I rented it, and the morning I watched it was the perfect movie to watch the mood I was in. (I do not want to move. beds). And though I tried to understand what happened to lead to the end that would ever be ruined by pop culture, it really did not succeed. Everything was everywhere, the relationships had no backbones, the end had no lead. Everything was a weird thing, and the supervisor has no choice but to let some of the amazement at the end of it, because even though we all know that it's people, there are quick answers to why people make every serious attempt to enjoy the film for anything other than the stupidity thrown out of the window.
