Hilar, laughs hard moments ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the plant ambulances, clogging the "dirty dirt," which then screams after them in anger, "you dirty the dirty," I mean wow, somebody's online rank in literature is rewarding! The worst scenario imaginable, with the introduction of the plot in a moment, ridiculous movement in the story, the development of the ZERO character (even among the characters that meet ... it is as if everyone knew and trusted each other for years days) effects and holes of plot .. oh, God there are holes of plot! To be honest, I write this without having watched everything, but I'm definitely expecting the last 30 minutes to not really enhance the shot already shot in the cinema ... thank God we have a good advantage to make somehow forget that the movie is a load of ... well ... use your imagination to end that sentence!
