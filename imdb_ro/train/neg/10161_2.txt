I really did not expect much from this movie seeing people from Parkersburg WV, who is if I lived, acting in it. This city is boring and this movie is the same. There were some decent scenes in the film, but I was distracted by all the points of attraction that they made to show them. The movie may have been good if there was no real action in it, but there was none. If you are not from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see every day, stay away from this movie. Dialogue will make you sleep, the act will bore you with tears, and Steven Soderberg would lose credibility after he shot such shit. It's a predictable movie without surprises. What you see is what you get and this is a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belper Ohio without a narrator.
