Man, I know what you're thinking: "With a title like this, I can not go wrong!" Yes Yes. And I loved the title, but the man hated the stupid child who played "Satan's little helper." And I hated my mother, my sister / daughter and her lover - I hated all those people! Man, it was agonizing this look at times! The only reason why this is not 1/10 is found with low budget, they have done well. But oh, the man hated those actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money using only Halloween masks for the killer, and the costume of Jesus at the end of the year was really stupid. Oh agony, do not look!
