The film could be watched while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight against boredom when the film depends on Meryl Streep to perform scenes without Jack; she was just as unhappy as she could. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters were portrayed before - and much better. It felt like a reality-based scenario in the worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or watching. Why did Ephron feel that life and relationship with Carl Bernstein were quite interesting to write about what is missing me. Perhaps she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting an episode of their life on paper is cathartic. Okay: But then why did someone in Hollywood feel this story worth filming remains a mystery to me.
