The extremely slow rhythm of this film was probably the director's express intention to express life as if he were raised as a teenager in China. However, I found a combination of the slow glacial "plot" and general shooting style so impersonal that it was totally alienated, especially for a Western public. Sometimes I had trouble telling some characters outside because they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours and I have taken full care. As someone who is not only interested in music, but also that it is very much in China's history and culture (and is on the path of the stranger to the Chinese cinema), I could not hire myself with a single character and find nothing to me get your teeth. The question is: If I did not like, who would want on earth? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of almost any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This bad effort is not measured at all. I'm sorry that the Chinese cinema is being judged against this point of reference.
