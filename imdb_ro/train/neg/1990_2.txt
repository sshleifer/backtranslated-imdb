This could be a powerful candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, he could be tolerated as a children's film. However, TRAGEDY of this effort is that John Hurt, one of the biggest screen actors, is diminishing in this ... I gave him two points just because Mr. Hurt showed ... I take AWAY 8 points , because it did not run fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as herself, can not act to save her soul. And the main actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can risk this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, it's almost HURT.
