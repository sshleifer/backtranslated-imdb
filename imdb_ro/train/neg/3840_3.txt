I've heard about this movie some time ago from a friend and recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement because we both heard that it was a terrible, even scary movie. How disappointed I was? VERY!!!! Besides the fact that a scene (we all know what bit) nothing happened! I expected to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do several scenes, such as going out to the window or going through the hallway or something like that. Almost all of the reviews here say what is a scary, exciting, atmospheric film. I did not realize I was afraid. Perhaps there is a difference in what people find in India scary here in the UK. A great left behind after all reviews hyped :(
