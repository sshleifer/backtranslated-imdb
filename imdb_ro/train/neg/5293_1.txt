I took this video after I read the text on the box, the story looked good and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how horrible the actor was, he goes and talks so bad all the time, is fake and not convincing. It does not end there, almost all the characters behave so badly that it is a spoiler, the only acceptable action was by Alan Boyce (David), but the man suicides early and you never see him again, you do not even know what he did! Everything about this movie is screaming for the low quality, I can not believe how such a thing is released! I was often tempted to stop watching, actually I did, half I decided to stop watching and stop it, I came to the IMDB to check what else else was thinking, I found zero comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and get back to finish, then come to comment. The only good thing to go (for me) was the rock high school theme, occasionally playing and playing guitar pieces, but that is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and directing ... Horrible movie.
