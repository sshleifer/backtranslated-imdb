I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point for this movie. For content that should be so "rebellious" and "controversial," the things Maddox distributes to students is terrible. Students appear to be slightly influenced by vague feelings of anti-authoritarianism and fraudulent misleading phrases on leaflets. Rebel, everyone. I suppose it would have been too much to ask for a teenage revolt movie in which a fire alarm at school would not work. The "huge fight on football fields" is a struggle consisting of two people. Character characters seem to vary greatly at random. A football jock that Maddox is fighting for (and who subsequently obtained a capsule on his face) is definitely a smile and sorry the next day. The fact that it does not reach any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that everything could have been mounted in half an hour after the special school. If he'd cut off most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
