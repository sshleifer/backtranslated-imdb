Let me start by saying that this movie has a funny point at first with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? I'm the new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the party? George: The new George is just lucky, I think. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only fun part in the whole movie. It was still fun ... But, again, I'm having fun easily ... <br /> <br /> I would not say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (this title goes to the movie terribly unpleasant disaster ...), this movie falls # 7 on my bottom list 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you are a little kid who is easy to enjoy, you will enjoy this movie. If you're a film observer who wants a good and funny movie, you'll end up shooting half that way.
