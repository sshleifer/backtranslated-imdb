When evaluating documentaries that focus on a relatively small group of ultra-right urban groups and conservative groups like this in the US, you need to keep in mind the following. The United States of 270 million inhabitants and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to support Human Rights that it has deficiencies and disadvantages. It is, of course, expected that extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups exist in a considerable number, but in proportion to the size of their population they are very small and isolated. On a per capita basis, Europe, the UK and even Australia have similar right-wing groups, in fact catches-based, the real size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States America. For the above reasons, it is not justifiable to delimit and vitiate the American people and its level of debate in the educated American society, fraudulently and misleadingly presenting this group of extreme right psychopaths representing American society. By doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small and isolated groups at the opposite ends of the spectrum to build a picture of America that is a surprising and deliberately sensational lie. This film is clearly designed to inflate and penetrate into the opinion of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and the way of life under the mask of fashionable spiritual ideology and idealist clich√© of the left. This film was made for profit not to promote the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can make documentation that focuses on ultra-right conspiracies, the industrial military complex, but fails to present a smart and balanced factual debate, not to mention alternative solutions to the failures of a vibrant democracy. The film show is exposed as Anti American by its support for this garbage. SENSALISM at the worst case of anti-US shameful garbage.
