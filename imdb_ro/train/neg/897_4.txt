Two years before writing and directing "Arthur," Steve Gordon had a small hit with the script for this crackpot comedy vehicle for Henry Winkler, then for "The Fonz". A 1950s college theater (and jerk around all) is a co-ed and marries without perspective of hiring on the horizon; to meet, return to the flamboyant world of struggle, eventually becoming a celebrity "Gorgeous George". Turning Winkler into an inappropriate hole he probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a safe way to separate him from his television alter ego), but jokes and situations are often wrong and heavy, by director Carl Reiner. Especially brutal is a bit of a victory involving Herv√© Villechaize ("Fantasy Island") moving Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). Just like Henry's lover, Kim Darby shows a little of her element - especially when surrounded by all these TV hamsthes - making the romantic look of the inconsistent scenario. * 1/2 from ****
