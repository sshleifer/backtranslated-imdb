For those who decide to watch this movie or read these comments for understanding, I first give you these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was shot down, pushed together quickly, and looks like it was entirely conceived by someone in line with a Hong Kong Burger King. I do not remember ever seeing a movie with an assortment of one-dimensional characters trying to make their way through such a playful script! It is an absurd effort with a ridiculous philosophical dialogue (a man wanders in his flooded apartment and offers the amazing revelation that "tears can be dried with tissue, but the water takes time to drain"). The same character is also seen having a profound and meaningful relationship with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. Still, the stray and stray chamber camera work was another annoying feature I could have done without it. And if this is not enough to make you face your popcorn, we hear the 60-year-old "California Dreaming" by Mamas and Papas, sneaking over the soundtrack over and over again in a sequence particularly long. /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his company Rolling Thunder Productions, although I can not for my life figure out why a man with his talent would bother. It was known that he remarked, "I'm glad to love a movie very much." Many of us, however, hope that they will focus on making their audiences happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
