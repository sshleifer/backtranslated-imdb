It is hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: poor action, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, inadequate sets for the period, poor scenario. It would have been nice if the script followed the original story a little closer - there is enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide great good material and a better story line than the scriptwriters might come up with. <br /> <br /> And why should we introduce a new weird weapon like a crossbow that burns the explosive screws? I see this movie was done in "only" 21 days. It is in the absence of quality. I begin to think this is the general (bad) attitude of the Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies of classical stories in recent years. !
