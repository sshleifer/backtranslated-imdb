This collection really is reproached! I hired her, thinking I'd really enjoy some good fights. This man sucks! The rapid rise, an extremely annoying speaker and the struggle with them have changed a lot and have been shortened (I especially thought about the fight of Jet Li in the Fists of Legend and the fight of Jackie Chan from drunk master 2 )> <br /> What's the deal with those streets? What's so cool about this? I've seen more interesting fights about the Martial Law! This stupid collection of cuts for foolish people. Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who have done this shit to do more of this stupidity! Instead, go buy movies fights have been from and fights in their uncircumcised glory!
