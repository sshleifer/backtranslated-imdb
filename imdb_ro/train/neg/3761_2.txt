foywonder's review of this inexpensive STV strikes the right angle on his head. Make sure you read it. If not, a group of scientists head to the deep forests of the Northwest Pacific to wreak havoc with a bunch of bones in an animal cemetery. The Big Foot family does not like this and continues to take their team one by one, mostly offscreen. Big Foot has a distinct face of a monkey, but it's less frightening than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the film has the general wood actors, claiming to be scientists who swam in the woods and get out. This is a budget-free movie that happens very little, at least on the screen. We get to look at the sexiest of the women taking a shower, while one of her male colleagues looks at the clocks, but nothing comes of it.
