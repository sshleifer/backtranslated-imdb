After reading all the rave comments on this movie and a few that give her a so-called. Finally, I decided to put up with no cents. I agree with most that if it were not for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. even to the north of Dogpatch, where all real talent fled to the south until 77 years ago, at least as far as a gas tank would allow. I made a chick from the reviewers who subtly claim that they are trying a little more than most, claiming they have followed this paradise without showing any confusion. This story from The Brothers Crook is like an old record with a jump in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties that Indian film artists have to face. A trip to Romania would definitely erase the budget. Let's face this whole movie was Claire Loop loop in the gas station, Claire on the road, Claire under the hunt, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire and Claire. It almost became monotonous and would have been if it were not the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to earn their living, but do not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty clicks. Before writing another scenario about ghost dreams, watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All of them, except those mentioned above, and a few others, were involved in their first and last film. There is also an aspect of co-director Jeff, as it is in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, right? One thing the film did was that the cameraman seemed to have a fix on Lauren Lewis's derby. Well, with all the sarcasm now pleased, I still recommend the horror film just to see this young actress during the formative career of her career (I hope), and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a bastard who deserves to watch.
