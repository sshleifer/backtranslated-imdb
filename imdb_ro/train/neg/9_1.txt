This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It breaks almost any type of thriller and manages to make a mess of all this. There is no single line or good character in the whole mess. If there had been a plot, it was a later thinking, and as far as it is acting, there is nothing good to say so I'm not saying anything. Frankly, I can not understand how this type of nonsense is produced and released, someone somewhere is not thinking at a certain stage: "Oh, my God, that's a bunch of shit," and I call it a day. The carp like this, which has people illegally downloading, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you download it, you did not waste your time or money. Do not waste time, that's painful.
