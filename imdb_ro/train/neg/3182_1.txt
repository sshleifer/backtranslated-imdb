The final justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people pulling people. Then he went to Malta where he shot more people. It often blocks to shoot people. Then he enters a battle with evil, who is dressed as a monk. There's a boat chase, and Joe Don ends up in jail. Eventually, Joe Don, with Elaine's help from "Seinfeld", killed the bad guy, threw a boat or two, and someone was shot. All of this, and an appealing thematic song, like Mitchell!
