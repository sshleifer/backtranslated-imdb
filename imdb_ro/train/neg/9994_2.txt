Hmmm, a sports team is in an airplane crash, gets stuck on a snowy mountain and faces the difficult decision to eat the meat of their dead comrades to survive. Call someone you know? I have referred to the Alive since 1993. The only major difference here is, of course, that a large, white, drunken crow from a Yeti appears several times to shoot the dead. I think people have better taste than yaks. Stupid: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would explode in the air, explode when it touches the earth or it will be erased. People would not have survived, but hey, it's science fiction. Stupid: They survived and are cold. It might be a good idea to squeeze some of the nearby burning remnants, not to freeze to death. The fire is hot as it is ... WTF: The pilot has frost formed on all face while living and talking, but strangely enough, no one else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the boys tells others to look for matches and briquettes, but they are scattered parts of the ON FIRE airplane around them. Stupid: They find clothes and anchors, and yet there in the cold of the Himalayas, they can not use the hotels! Stupid: He looks at a bunch of sticks when, I reiterate, there are pieces of the ALTERNATI BURNING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for its storms. It would be normal to collect their debris to strengthen their structure rather than stand outside the circles. There are plenty of pins around, whose branches make excellent isolation. WTF: In case of doubt, use a dead man arm as a staff. WTF: If anyone knows so much about the hibernation habits of the Himalayan squirrels, bears, and leopards, then why does not he know enough to take shelter and put traps right from the start? Stupid: When you try to catch wild animals, the mindless conversation in the vicinity of traps will always help. WTF: Do you know how hard it is to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight against Yeti, while the other two stood there without defense. Yeti snatched the guy's heart and hit the girl's head, and the tape did nothing. There is love. So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever ... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story goes on in more idiotics, but the biggest action appears in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Beautiful thinking with the spear and the chain, though this is an invention (with the chain that appears magically) that they did not miss at the beginning of the movie, when they could not even make a fire despite being around them. <br /> <br /> As is typical of sci-fi originals, the loving couple kisses at the end of the year as nothing terrible happened to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and did not brush their teeth in a few days ). <br /> <br /> The end itself is, however, blade quotes.
