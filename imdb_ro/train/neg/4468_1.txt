OK, simply, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), keep up with the legend. It is undoubtedly the most disappointing game TR yet. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is totally impractical and I gave up. I feel like I was robbed of Eidos. It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In ODA they were "sticky", but the same general control sequences. In the legend, they have completely changed their movements and control methods, and it is totally uncontrollable. I've seen comments elsewhere from people who say "Use the mouse". No, why should it? Others say, "Use a gamepad." No, why should it? Others say that "But this was the standard for 3rd person controls for years" Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why disappoint it. I know, because they can not care less about their original, loyal fans, want to pay for the new children who have not even heard the show until the movies have gone out and made much more money. Pathetic. My advice to any serious TR fan is to keep away from this game, and if you buy it, complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, especially on the Eidos forums, from people who told them how rubbish it is, maybe they will listen to it.
