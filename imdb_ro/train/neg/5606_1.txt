I think Shakespeare explained what I read nicely. I think he (the lady) protests too much. Everything sounded like the author would try to convince himself! He placed profane literature (writings of the same time but not related to the Bible), but I can often think of at least three references from the top of my head that give historical precision to the events contained in Bible. Anyone can change their data and prove anything they like, but it's not true. The word changes, word definitions change over time (look at English and German, where a common root is obvious) nothing remains the same, everything evolves and changes forever. The Bible has many different translations, but the King James version is the one we found the best when it comes to any kind of research. In King James, you will notice that there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be abandoned and the mean of the whole verse is changing. The writings around Christ's time were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like a long word and the translators have all added above. For example, how did you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read that God is not nowhere or do you read that God is now here? The same string of letters has two completely different meanings. This is the reason why many Bible scholars use a "Lexicon" to assist them in translating because they provide a word translation for a word in the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when it translates into symbolic logic, you can prove that there is God, but you can not prove that He does not exist! Finally, I like to listen to people who think they are so intelligent that they are qualified to judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Put the soap box, God bless the Maegi
