Something's happening in this movie. There are only brief bizarre scenes in which I did not know what the hell was happening, so it does not matter. This movie is so boring that it hurts, and it comes from a person who likes when the movies are about making movies. Confused? I was after watching these nonsense. What was Donald Sutherland, because he missed it completely. And what about the "pedophile" scene at the beginning of the movie? Maybe someone can sleep! 4/10
