The only redemption qualities that this movie has is the rather original death scenes. Apart from the fact that this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, a mad housewife who is slowly moving through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. from the movie, which adds nothing. Then the movie takes on a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks that took 2 parking places on this early Xmas contortion. They begin to follow her after they started the local guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie gets worse, and worse. I know her only movie and you have to go with the flow, but it's about 5 minutes. headstart and can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, it leads to a half-subdivision built near a forest. She usually does everything she can to allow her followers to pursue her with ease. But now it turns into a tough mofu. You got it. Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this guy. It's so illogical that you ask any scene. It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and for the rest of the distributors as well as for the consumers.
