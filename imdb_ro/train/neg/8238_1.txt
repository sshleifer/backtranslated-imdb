This movie was positively the worst movie I've ever watched. I could not stand on this whole thing. I also think the writer must have strange fetishes for the women who are moving and colliding ... I mean what it was all about! I can not believe it was done even I disgusted that I won a rental fee of Â£ 4. The quality of both the image and the sound is terrible, the actor ... does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie, and scenes of pee, carp and pucker recall two girls with a cup. Urghh ....... EVER AT ALL COST! The girls looked as if they were taken from the street and took part just because they would be willing to take their charts ... While these girls have beautiful bodies, they certainly did not do it because the cries theirs were terrible, unconvincing and painful for my ears. Was it (perhaps worse) than an amateur school production without a proper direction and hey does not need a set, because everything seems to rotate around a car? <br /> <br /> I do not like to buy. Sorry if my first comment is extremely negative, but I did not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I can save someone else who loses the money as I did.
