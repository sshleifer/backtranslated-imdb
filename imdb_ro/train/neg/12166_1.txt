Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, relates to Bruce), the killer from the first movie, is up to the old tricks again. He's one of the Camp Rolling Hills counselors. As long as the girls at the camp are beautiful and stay away from sex, the drugs and swindling things are good. But a step over the line and Angela killed them - crack jokes bad all the way. The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty spitting movie, but it had some good points to it. This is vicious and ugly too, but has no good point to it. The plot was made with death, and that does not add anything new to the formula. There are a lot of gorilla killings here (people are burned alive, the heads are cut, the neck cut), but all the gorillas are so obviously false that they actually became comic. This also has the smallest amount of trailer I've ever seen and practically everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, free female nudity (offered here by Valerie Hartman extremely untouched) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins, the action is simple - even through film shooting standards. There is also a cruel edge for this movie in which a character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, useless nudity and bad gore. Move on.
