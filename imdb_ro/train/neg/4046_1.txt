What insult the film industry SA! I have seen better SA movies. The comments I've read about the Hijack Stories, saying she's worth ten out of ten, are pretty scary. The rating of the film should not depend on "O, a film from a developing country. It spells the industry by saying things about their work, even if it is stupid." We have the expertise to make good movies. Do not judge the cinema industry about what people say how great they think they are Hijack Stories. We can tell great stories, such as Weep your beloved country and Shaka Zulu. I cry out of my beloved country, I'll give 9 out of 10. Darryl's Big Director, a great action of two great old actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories .., I'll give 1 out of 10. There can only be people involved in the project that would give high scores. I would have done the same if it were my movie.
