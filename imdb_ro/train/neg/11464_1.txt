While I do not claim to be an expert in marine life, I have to say that anyone with a small intelligence could not buy this whale notion (and not even the mother!) Having a clue about revenge because he witnessed his death with a forced abortion of people! I mean, indeed! This is, in principle, the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been very hard for the roles to have accepted this junk. This is a kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it, you would feel as if you were asking for the money back.
