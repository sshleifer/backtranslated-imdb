I saw this movie at my own cinema (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and my uncle. I was around 11 and 12, I think, and indeed in frightening movies. I remember that I was so excited to see because my cool uncle allowed us to choose the movie (and we probably never did that again!) And then I was disappointed! Just boring and not scary. The only redemption thing I could remember was the Corky Pigeon from the Silver Spoon, and that was not that great, just someone I admitted. I've seen bad movies before, and that's always been in my mind as the worst. That was from what I remember, one of the most dull, non-scary loss of our $ 6 team and a loss of film. I've read some reviews that say they deserve an hour and say, "All his own," but I would not even bother. Not even that bad is good.
