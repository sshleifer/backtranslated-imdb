I can not describe how terrible this movie is. Am I the only one who finds the way his animation is totally disgusting? The men in Rohan show 100% false with poorly colored hair, which does not even approach what the actors look like. Orcs looked terrible. Why does gandalf go with a bad torment? Why can not I say things right? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that looked like a terrible spelling of Tolkien characters. Everyone and everyone is glad that the studio that did this has pulled the plow out, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go hobbit cartoon watch for a better cartoon Tolkiens cartoon. Hell, even ROTK's cartoon version is better than a dribbling. 2/10
