Okay, after watching this refreshing film and wasting an hour and so many minutes out of my life, it's the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom box, gives this baby with her vagina hair 3 wishes, the baby wasting desires what I forget what, shaq sucks rapping, and I think that's it. So I basically laughed, we cried ...... but mainly I laughed at the sheep comedy that came from the wonderful nba player / rapper actor and shaggy-haired boy. I highly recommend this movie to faculty kids who sit around drinking some beer with their close friends and are in need of a good shave. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it 3 out of 10 just b / c the movie is based on 3 magic wishes. If I had three wishes, I would be wiping out this horrible movie and for everyone to claim that Hollywood did not waste money to do that.
