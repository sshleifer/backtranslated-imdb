I do not think I was so much inspired by the simple absurdity of a movie in my life as I was when I got out of this piece of shit. Nothing in it makes sense. none of them is intelligent or well thought out. because of the lack of really tense moments, they repeatedly use that trick in which you build the music before the character does something like opening a door or pushing a curtain and then nothing there. thats OK to do once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things thrown in, without apparent reason, characters, story lines formed in half ... the characters were not well developed at all. the end was .. bad. evil, evil, evil, everything, every part of this movie is terrible. and I'm here to warn you.
