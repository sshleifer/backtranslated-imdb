Like last year, I did not manage to stay on the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock, as a host, was a good choice because it was vague. Or rather, out of all the total holes packed in the theater, at least it was not in the Top 10 the most overnight. A lot of presenters, on the other hand, were in this Top 10 coveted. I did not know that everything was done autocue (although I knew it was written), but it was terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to enter expressions, to look at the tac and to stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman, if there is no director, she left). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tiring, Beyonce Knowles broke down some good songs and there were very few discourses and decent clips of acceptance. Adam Sandler wins the worst presenter award. Because it helped me write this review, I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my pedicurists for all of them believed in me and I would like to emphasize that I have a high metabolism and, of course, I was hungry for a month. I will not cry ... thank you.
