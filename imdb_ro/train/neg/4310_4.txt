This film is about a very sexy Olympic star who is committed to training a high school boy's basketball team. Like Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, she plays Cathy Lee Crosby as the lead, and she does as much as the scenario allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but given the movie's apparent movie budget, he probably could not afford it. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, at least without surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn plays the role of male lead. He is the star of the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some funny scenes like the rich old man who runs the athletic program and does not think that a woman should engage in sports. This point is brought throughout the movie, and, not to mention, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not set up his team through unorthodox practice sessions; she does not do anything that a male coach would not do. There is a funny subterprise that involves a tall and not so brilliant player who suffers from hypnosis to promote classes and play as the Sydney Wicks probaskeist. It seems everyone had a good time to make this film, but the only real reason to see is for Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has a stunning smile, beautiful hair and a very young body.
