I also looked at this movie and otherwise it is very well done, I realized it was a heartbeat and would not recommend it to women who have small children. The terror on the mother's face when she sees her child about being driven by a train is really upsetting. And the sad things are: - inside dies. Eventually he returns to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world that makes you do dolls does not hide the pain it has. I remember her desperate face while pulling money out of her clothes to try to heal her baby. I'm surprised that this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also a route for the poor in the mountains.
