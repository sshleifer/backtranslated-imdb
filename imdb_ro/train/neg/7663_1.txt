Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually big) as a dollar shop Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... and is STEPHEN DORFF FOR CHRIST SAKE !!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for their work and efforts. You are. It was an idea, just my humble opinion, that the film that goes public but follows directly with your previous choices, a film about the brightest neuro-physicist in history inventing a pill to heal all the diseases ever known to man and get it which must be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you loved it. Really, although I owe my $ 7.50.
