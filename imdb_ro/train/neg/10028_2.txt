I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more since it was a Yashraj movie. Jimmy operates a call center and one day Pooja Singh is invited to teach his boss, Englishman Lakhan Singh. The two fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy he can not do this because he owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and only then that Jimmy notes that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to watch Jimmy and Pooja. In the role of Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed by director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Yes! The landscape is good, and Kareena Kapoor (and her very popular loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely thin on the story and sometimes it does not make sense from one scene to another - that's why I said from the beginning that I expected more of this film as if it were a Yashraj production. Regarding the songs, unfortunately, there is no song I can remember right now. There are times to laugh and this is mainly because Akshaye Kumar and Saif could certainly have done better while Kareena Kapoor played his role well. But this can not be said for Anil Kapoor - he did not seem like a bastard. Last but not least, Aditya Chopra, who previously produced and directed good movies like "Mohabbatein," what did Yash Chopra do by producing such a garbage film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie is not worth wasting time and this is my first and last impression.
