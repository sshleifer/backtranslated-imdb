This miserable movie is a remake of a 1927 film. They should have let him stay that way. What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks has absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero has a real role, and Bette Grable plays with a chorus - What will I do with that Hungarian? The ridiculous park deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now let's go more quickly 300 years later, where Grable, just married Count Romero, faces a similar situation when her wedding night invades the Hungarian soldiers. Romero acts as a coward and runs away before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to stay at the castle when his violin likes Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole fucking movie when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - a furious romero annulled marriage. This poor film imitation was made in 1948. As Harry Davenport, a veteran veteran who was in him, died in 1949; this was his last film. What a bomb to come up with such a remarkable career. Walter Abel collaborates, but he can not do too much with such a bad writing. The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
