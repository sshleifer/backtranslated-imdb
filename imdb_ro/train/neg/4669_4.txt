It is interesting that a novel without a plot has become the basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good fit, if not very accurate adaptation, Washington Square is a hard-to-handle machine, except for Dr. Sloper's part, which could have been much better. The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I came back. It has no subdued and simple beauty that can have a plot-free movie, like Onegin. I agree with other comments on Leigh's portrayal of Catherine as an idiot instead of naive and shy; she made me despise not to feel it for her. Catherine's passage from children's confidence to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalized, as in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice that tells us that in a movie! I think somebody jumped to the film adaptation class. I appreciate the director's attempts to make from a difficult text a moving and beautiful film, but it just did not work.
