A fairly common, Italian-Western story, foolish, clitoral, lacking in logic, mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punches and people pulling dead on a massive scale. to deal with Django. - At least not in my version translated into German, the German version of DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan fights against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead, because their gang has killed her (the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the group broke up. And you have the role of Ironhead against all, because he is anyway the biggest and the most greedy. Yes, that's no more than intelligence in the story, hehe. A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In a scene he tries to separate two men by struggling by striking them and screaming "I said love!" and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC! It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi made the film - I love this master of incompetent-thrash exploitation, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
