Five minutes in this movie you realize you've seen it before. It's HEAT CAMERA. It's the COMPANY. And it's the DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there are no new elements here. Except for the clear Bill Gates-allegory. Congresses are always good for movies, but why should they be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie, because - at least for a little while - seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is the fact that your boss pays an impostor to be your girlfriend, to make you work harder and control yourself? I would give 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
