Film and acting are not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante, but the movie forgets it's supposed to be a prequel for a successful movie. Manufacturers of this prequel did not clearly see Carlito's path or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already set a story for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least leads to him. None of Carlito's close friends from the original make an appearance in this movie, not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975, and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Since this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier, do not you think that one of Carlito's friends would make an appearance for a long time? Originally, Carlito's release is released from prison after spending five years in prison. That's just a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito spent five years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this happy ending in Hollywood, it is an insult to the intelligence of the original fans. What's going on with Gail? Lack of continuity has made this movie go straight to the release of the film.
