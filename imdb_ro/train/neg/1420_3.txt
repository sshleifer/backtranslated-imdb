[I saw this movie lately on a public television stand, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple in the early 1930s. It's hard to believe that someone would let their daughter be in this little film, which today could be considered just that part of "baby porn". Shirley Temple plays in a cast who probably has an average age of 5 years. They are all in diapers and are in a salon that serves milk instead of alcohol. Cash is in the form of a lollipop. Shirley, who plays a "fatal female," returns to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her (!). But Shirley does not need slices of lillipops / money, because her bag is full of other "men". Meanwhile, a little black boy makes a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). </ b> <br /> What a strange movie. . . infants who use the laughing dialogue that plays adult roles in a salon. Who believed this in any way?
