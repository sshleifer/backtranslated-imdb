Fans of artistic films have to bear a lot of terrible movies lately. The blood surge joins shamelessly with the list of stupid and redundant titles of ridiculously large animal worms that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles have a great success, as we had to fight through the abisal "crocodile" (directed by a disappointing Hooper Hooper) and "Lake Placid". Blood surge is as bad as other movies and? over ?? he likes to exaggerate extraordinarily. The salt water crocodile is supposed to be 90 years old, 30 ft long! (!) And kill for fun! During the movie, he amuses himself by devouring a lot of stupid surfer and dudettes who have come to look for new emotions by navigating in a shark congestion area. The only beautiful thing about this movie is the tropical location. Even if it is a completely inadequate frame for such a movie, lagoons and nature look great. Any other aspect is simply disastrous. There is a bit of gore, but everything seems fake and ridiculous. Dialogues are painful to listen! You will not believe some of the lines that these actors have to say! I know surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope for themselves they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters refers to the Jaws as a "mechanical toy," but the croc here shows at least 10 times less true than that of Spielberg's big shark. The visual effects of "Blood Surf" are amateur and the massacres fail to impress. I will not say too much about acting because it is secondary to movies like this. The girls look sexy in wet t-shirts, and her breasts jump as she escapes the beast. You guessed well: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad becomes fun again. But "funny" for another reason than James Hickox intended.
