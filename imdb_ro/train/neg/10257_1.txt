This movie has had an extraordinary cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - b-film actors. But this downer of a movie has never used any of them for any kind of advantage, none of their characters have ever met on the screen (though Christopher Lee is playing against him in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for the extraterrestrials in this movie seem to change when a hat falls. First of all, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then return the main character by killing most of their friends and without releasing their wife after receiving the crucial part they need. Then, from nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides that it must destroy the planet because it causes too many "illnesses" (although it gives the main character and his wife a place in their society). /> Most of the movie is spent watching man and wife, or walk or stand or sit in the office without doing anything. You almost wanted them to have left with the rest of the planet at the end, just for revenge because it bored us to death. If you do not really like Chris Lee or sci-fi with seventy low-budget, I'd miss you. It falls into that narrow range of celluloid scattered between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Target.
