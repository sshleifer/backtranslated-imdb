We have found that this is a total waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows the lack of creativity when filming "direct-to-video" - but rebalancing the script of the original movie with a "new perspective" is a low level ... soon it will just be re-launching original movies with new animations and new songs and calling it "a new version of the movie we all love". Nathan Lane returns surprisingly to Timon once more. Timon and Pumbaa Animated Animals from the original "Lion King" engage in a narrative journey to tell us the original story as it really did ... as they see it. Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... The musical sequences are blades and animation is shit. Voice Talks are impressive for a video feature, but again when it was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in any commercial reality? Generally, if you liked the original, you hate it. It is insulting because it is unjust in children and adults. And that's what's happening.
