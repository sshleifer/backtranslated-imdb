This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only interesting thing in this movie is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and the king himself. The movie has a big premise, but it breaks for about 15 minutes in the story. I liked Madchen Amick in this movie and I think he could have a very good career in the movie.
