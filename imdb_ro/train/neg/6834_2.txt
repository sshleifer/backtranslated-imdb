Gee, what the hell of film! ... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies of all decades, so I decided to start this. It was a pretty good choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost stones and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see anything like this in this pastel colored mess. I have not watched many bad movies before, but I feel that this is called the "so bad it's good", probably because it's so damn funny unintentionally! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies about plotting, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter, in particular, are as crazy as Van Damme's cheeks inside that blue spandex. They are too sticky lines and I will not even start talking about some of the hilarious action moves. There is not a bad attitude on the part of all those involved in that hot film, except for a particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, who is an absolutely stupid character. And to tell the truth, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He succeeded in gaining a different tone and mood in the two roles that were convincing to me. But the movie was largely very bad, and the sad part is that it was produced by a big movie studio ... which is now bankrupt.
