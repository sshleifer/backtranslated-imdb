Maria Bello does not seem to care about why people think about her choices in film roles. Again, she chooses a very difficult and useless film to star in. Perhaps he needs those films to descend the sugar-covered ones ("Hollywood") he's doing here and then (Coyote Ugly and, of course, Mummy 3). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While I think she fails to do what she wants to do (I will not hurt her), Maria Bello is as great as the other independent / small films she plays. movie. This, combined with the strange subject, almost made a trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to ignore some flaws, such as bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
