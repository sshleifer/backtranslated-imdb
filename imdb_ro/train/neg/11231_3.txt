I like low-budget, independent films and I have great hopes for this movie. But this movie is static. It does not matter the value of production, which is very noble for her budget, but the rhythm is deadly. Of course, these people realize a lot, but the film fails to the most basic level. It's boring. Edit is glacial and rhythm stalls. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who is not seen nearly enough. It had the greatest potential. Instead, we must suffer through the demise of Baltimore-British stammer through endless exposure and exhaustion. It feels like a scene scene back, dedicated to the movie. Everyone's noble efforts in production, but a tired story needed a trouser shot and a low-budget new voice technology. Instead, it's just a rewrapped blade.
