I watched this movie because I noticed she had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. For a long time I have had a theory about her, she is a talented actress, but she never seems to show it, because she's always in this low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful and she is still trying to act on the unfortunate material I always see. There is nothing else. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not do well. George Wendt played against the guy who was so offensive to recognize his role. Another note about Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have diminished significantly since I saw her last. Maybe reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. This is NOT a bad thing. She still looks great. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
