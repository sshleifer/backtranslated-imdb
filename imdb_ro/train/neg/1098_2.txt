I have this movie in the Walmart $ 5 basket. I would not recommend watching this move. I might give it to one of my friends if I'm mad at them and I want to suffer for two hours. I looked at the cover and summed it up and thought it was a war movie. I would have liked to know how boring this movie was before it started. It was my mistake to believe that something will happen in this movie. This is a group of people who go from one boot camp to another. The drill roar treats soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people out of the battle in Vietnam. Okay, here's my turn about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to forget. It was just one of those movies that you put and are stuck watching because you want to stop it, but you hang on a series of hope that it might rise towards the end of the year. It is not like that. After the movie ended, I went through it behind Tv because I was angry that I lost nearly 2 hours of my life watching it for another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.
