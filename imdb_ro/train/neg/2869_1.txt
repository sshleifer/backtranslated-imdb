The story goes that way, Netflix delayed me sending my DVDs, so I went down to the analog rental site known as "Blockbuster Video". Very bad, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for watching pleasure, but I never want to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by her lonely self. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see those things. Anyway, I put this DVD and suddenly from the first second, it sucks. I'm staying with b.f. and we are like, "what is this kind of nonsense?" Inoperative operation of the room, horrible act - the first scene in which a woman is killed, wondering if she would prefer to take revenge rather calmly, then a rat fills her throat. I really wonder if the director has a mistake for these crap. There is nothing decent on this "movie". All I have to say to the director is "do you have a tripod"? Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was like they just decided someday to make a movie. Probably gathers people from WalMart to look and act for them. Just terrible. If you make such a movie, directing is the hobby - NOT what you should do to live - You could not get to renal kidney DVDs for movies like me. Better go home for your friends when you spend a party and get out of interesting things to have fun with ... Then you burst in your BTK KIller movie and say, "You want to see this great movie I am once? "
