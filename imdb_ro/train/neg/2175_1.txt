Carlos Mencia continuously, violently, shouting ugly "B ** ch!" in women is like crying "N ** ger!" to the black, except that it is worse. Remember, word B, unlike word N, is the only pejorative term that is associated every day with violence. "B ** ch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or killed. This type is the perpetuation of violence through the ugly use of the language of violence. Looks like she could be a homosexual guy trying to cover up with women's beatings, so he'll sound like a hetero. And what do you say to all the white nasal boys in their audience who have fascist greetings, while their stupid white women, bimbo, sneak on the other side, clearly afraid to protest against this wave of female ugly. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support freedom of speech for YOU! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to have freedom of speech to b ** ch-slap so loud and violent and big-mouthed like you, or do you think "free speech" is just for men to laugh on women ???
