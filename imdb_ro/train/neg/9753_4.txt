I am grateful for one thing and for one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a totally different continent! Hurray!!! This program summed up very well how obsessed was Victoria Beckham with whoring her and her family to the media in the name of self promotion and "Beckham Brand flickering". A few years ago used as "Posh and Becks," I still admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand pushed behind him using her as a doll. It was clear that Victoria's hand was over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing happened in Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live on the fact that, although he could earn an apology for pounds, he sold his soul to American Buck and will end his days playing for a team that will strive to win promotion from Division One in England - but at Baseball and Basket you run - the football you do not!) Anyway - I'm right. It's been years since we've seen such a performance from Posh - this was only seen during her performances on the red carpet tracked after Rebecca Loos's debut, when instead of throwing all the cr David deserved, he touched desperately trying to save the money that the one-million-pound marriage had made. Everything was pathetic. Why can not she go there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of her professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so self-important that she feels that moving to America should be shrouded by this great prize for fans? <br /> <br /> Moreover, I saw David Beckham last night. At least he kept a piece of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning. Another Victoria thing - you complain that you are constantly beaten by popes. The little hint - stop them from blaming them where your fool is. <br /> <br /> America's good luck!
