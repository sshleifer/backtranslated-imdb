Usually I do not write reviews, but I do not understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers because I can only assume that all these high ratings were given by TV media observers. <br /> <i> I watched only the first two episodes, but the two were so clich√©, it was not even funny. the same old stories you have seen / read many times already - living toys, bad things of other dimensions ... and not only that these stories are not innovative, but rather bad versions of these cliques. I would prefer eg. "chucky" and "silent hill" along these two episodes anytime. and do not even ask about the visual effects ... the ones in the first episode are good, but those in the second ... terrible. shows that a movie student's project went wrong. blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. it might be interesting for a ten-year-old kid who probably did not see / read that many scary stories yet (although I would rather recommend "beyond faith" - now that's what I call a decent TV show). but for an adult horror fan, this is of no value. I gave only 3 points because there is, in fact, a beautiful cinema (especially in the second episode) and some beautiful action.
