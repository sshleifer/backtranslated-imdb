Why did I lose 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this movie made? Why do I even comment on this movie? A commentator said that this movie had the patience to watch and it was not for everyone. I can not figure out who this movie is. maybe after giving up an acid blow, THE NEXT, Some might follow this and do something out of it. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's a simple and simple garbage. The movie does not follow any line of plot, just when you think you have something, well ..... no. <br /> <br /> I think the end has brought some finale to the movie (without a word of intent), the spectator gets a glimpse of what might happen. I do not think we put a spoiler here, not that it would matter. This film is another thing to be lost in the movie world.
