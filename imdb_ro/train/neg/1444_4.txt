The film is very long and, unfortunately, quite different from the novel. If you want to see the movie, then do not read the novel first because it will shock you. However, cinema was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres exploring Africa, then go to it. Current performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis searches for his missing brother, rather than a lady looking for her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave, while here he turned out to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
