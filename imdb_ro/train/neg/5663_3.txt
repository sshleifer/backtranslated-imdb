This is for Zatoichi movies that the "Star Trek" movies were in "Star Trek" - except that in this case each of the original was more fun and exciting than this great, brilliant re-make, better done if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen it, I would have thought well but empty; since I had, I thought its inappropriate style and its inadequate content. The idea of ​​invigorating character into a larger production, slicker must have sounded good, but it had no use but hope of making money; is just a show that, for the most part, fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and fails to take the character wherever it has not already been (also the actor was not the best). I was hoping to see Ichi in a late stage of life, in a story that he could see with grace and draw conclusions from his general experience; this just rehashes bits and tracks from other movies, spiced with more sex and sfx violence. It's not the same experience at all.
