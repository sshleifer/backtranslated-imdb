I suppose it's nice and fashionable to see wonderful things in the absolute glory of a movie like this one. With the sometimes unnecessary excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene without explosions, dirty language and horns. Minimalism takes place and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of these cases. Take long scenes without dialogue and noisy landscaping. I'm sure he must have great significance and understanding, because the implicit message was shrouded in confusion. The actor is weak ... gentle and pedestrian ... and has one of the worst scenes of crying in history (at the end of the movie, if you can stand up to the end). The landscape is unusual, and the ridiculous end of the girl passing through the sterile park is just as enjoyable as having a tooth pulled. I would call this anticlimatic, but because the film is not based on any climax ... even in "erotic" scenes ... it would be untrue. I'm sure there was a scenario used during the filming, but with the dialogue volume, I think it could have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie does not give anything of interest or amazement ... no great story, no stunning insight, no visual drama, no enthusiasm. Apart from two or three fun moments, the movie is a two-hour loss. A tragic and boring movie.
