Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays a contemporary obsessed-looking adolescent who is trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this film B, which is not particularly well done, but is still surprisingly serious in mind about its main character. Silverstone is appealing and successful to carve an interesting young woman here, despite the kiss of the painting. Distribution support (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad though the violence in the last act goes overboard. It's not a festive camp, but nothing remarkable. * 1/2 from ****
