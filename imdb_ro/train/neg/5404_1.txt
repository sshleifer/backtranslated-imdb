Have you ever gotten that anger to kill just an hour or two doing business and seeing a movie so bad that it defies the reason? Renting movies at a weekend sees box art for this and I see T-Rex. Knowing very well that the dinosaur on the pack was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I knew I had to rent it just because I was in a mood for a bad movie. I was not disappointed by the least. Mad scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned with wealth and stockholders than life and, of course, a big, poorly animated T-Rex doll. Is it me, through our film, that the scenes are clearly related to other films? Not to mention Rex's hunger is never satisfied ... ever. How hungry it is beyond me because it really does not have a neck (Actually, if you look down on your mouth when it laughs, it's solid ... like a toy or something like that). Now, I love seeing incredible bad B movies from time to time, because it reminds me how good a successful movie is. It was hilarious. I'm not even sure it should have been a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes in which, you make no mistake, you'll laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the movie budget ... yes, but the act did not help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, for some female roles ... when crying should not come "tears"? Meh, I will not be upset about this movie, I knew what I was going through and if you were looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then watch Jurassic Park and Lost World backwards. You will write Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the next day.
