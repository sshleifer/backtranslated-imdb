Why did I visit this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in him and in the past he made funny movies that made me cry out of laughter, so you blame me because you're expecting yourself again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the involvement of Jennifer Aniston, and the fact that it was a state hit by the state encouraged me. However, as my "one-line summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour film, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time when I sat down thinking "I should have had some ice cream." I admit it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what really expects when he makes Gem, such as "The Truman Show", "Liar Liar," "Me, Myself and Irene" Dumber " , "Mask" and "Ace Ventura" then produce, in Bruce Nolan's words, a film so mediocre? Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was criminally subscribed, I mean, hello! She was in the public eye about 10 years ago, and in this movie she has about four lines to say. "Mistakes." Reason 3: A word - Clich√© Reason 4: Occasional unfolding of specific American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite "Moving the Week" for the film is specifically the home appeal appeal. "A teenager says not to drugs and give to education - it's a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? Become a miracle! "God tells Bruce a feeling of maneuver that seems to have come down to the United States, but he may face stronger resistance in markets that retain a doubt about subtlety In addition, I'm still going to school and this statement suggests that I and all my friends are miracles ... or maybe it just means we have brains? In this movie there are plenty of funny moments of Carrey to make you chicote and prevent them Bruce Almighty to be a total calamity, but you are advised to start your expectations down.
