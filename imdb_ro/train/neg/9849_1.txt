This is one of the most serious movies I've ever seen! It's bad, even at TV Movie standards. The story is diabolically flawed, and the names that are known in this movie are scattered by confused and unsafe characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a movie together - it's so bad. Tortured as a "psychological horror thriller" - it's certainly Horrific. There is nothing thrilling about that. And it could make you psychological damage! Initial opening scenes had such a promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the total strangeness that followed the scene of the car is beyond belief. No matter how hard you try, you could not care less of the characters. There are so many ideas sprinkled that the film is at most a collage of phrases disconnected from Chinese philosophers and at worst the movie would make you go to Brain Dead! I bought over 300 DVD movies, and that's the FIRST that I will get my money again. STEER CLEAR.
