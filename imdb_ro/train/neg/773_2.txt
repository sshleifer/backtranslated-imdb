No, not the GWB administration, Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". Lifetime must have realized what a dog was because the series was burned by two episodes at a time, most of them diffusing between 11:00. Friday morning and 1 in the morning on Saturday morning. As for the reason I have been following all this, I can only plead for sudden weekly masochistic seizures. Most distributions are unknown that are likely to remain unknown. The only two recognized names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn into the only decent performances (Jones does not do it through the whole series - Lucky Woman). Ward, by the way, ages well from Thorn Birds. The main thread of the plot - which killed the heroine father, who was wrongly condemned to kill his father but was released after six years in slammer - has been stretched for so long and ended so hurriedly that he will not care for you especially who let him. There is a lot of "steam" sex, more murders and all sorts of rude behaviors - practically none of them is either interesting or credible. Most of the distribution is not particularly attractive and certainly not talented. Writing and direction are on par with the distribution. <br /> <br /> If you stay all the way, the postcard is a hohot (very minor). <br /> <br /> CONSIDER YOURSELF!
