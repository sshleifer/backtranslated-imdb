I just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. City-wall paintings seemed terrible. The mafia characters also seemed too weird. Warren Beatty did not do a great job like Dick Tracy, but it was certainly not a better performance. Madonna should be alone. Glenne did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie 2/10 because of the amazing action of Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he did another good job.
