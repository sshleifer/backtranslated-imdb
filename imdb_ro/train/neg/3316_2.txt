This was the first movie Ewan McGregor I saw outside Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan, but I can not yet forgive myself for the existence of this film. My sister has always been a great fan of Jane Austen and for this reason I have been subject to various classics, Emma being one of them. I have always considered it irritating, bad and boring. However, after seeing this terrible extradition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor has only a purpose in this movie after he hacked and mutilated Frank Churchill's side. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in a ridiculous character, and the rest of the film is unrecognizable and stupid. My recommendation to anyone who is interested in dramatic distances in English ... visits the originals. If you are a fan Ewan McGregor ... believe me, by jumping on this movie, you missed nothing but five minutes collectively of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.
