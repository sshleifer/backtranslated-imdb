Let's see where to start ... bad; I'm not sure if I would just say that, as it reads more on the line of a script effortlessly. The actors did not even seem to be in their parts, and they seemed rather lifeless and wingless. Of course there was a scene or two with nudity, but that could not save this movie from its lifeless characters. To appeal to the main character, a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics did not have rhythm or flow, and they seemed rather along the lines of meaning. Budget? Did the film even have a budget? They seem to have used less money than I saw in a YouTube home video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound post-production. Bad bad effects if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story could have been good if people were interested in doing so, but there was no life for this film; I did not care who guided it. I have seen very bad shots in the last year and this is certainly at the bottom. Do not waste your time or you will want to listen to this impartial review. Check your ratings, you'll see that the number 1 quickly exceeds bread by 10 with almost nothing. I would have liked to look a little harder before losing my time. What a suge-fest!
