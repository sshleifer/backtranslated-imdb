I did not like this movie for many reasons. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to save, at least for me, they would have to retreat from the enormous hole they had scraped. Unfortunately, this has not happened. The two draws of the film for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work that he was interested in what he would bring to the film. After that, I felt disappointed for all three, even though in each of their shows there were "moments". I imagine that for each of them to find their "moments" it was a very difficult task, given that there was a lack of stunning character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the whole movie is so badly written, directed and edited that the performance of anyone as an actor would suffer and be affected by it. The disrespectful way of dealing with sexual abuse and the banal and insulting view of the small town of America, I think, were the two main reasons why this film failed to hit his mark. As a commentator noticed and I agree, the film is almost impossible to sell, given the final form. I suspect that, or at least I hope (for actors, anyway) there are real stones on the floor of the room. Sad for us, but if that's true, then the actors can console themselves as they feel somewhat good about crediting their talents and their time for such a flop. Oh, yes, another thing ... I just wished I could see an American movie that included unparalleled disappearance but wonderful bucolic settings such as the one in this movie where the main characters did not have it was absentmindedly and / or disrespectful littering the countryside with pop boxes, destroyed CDs and other such garbage!
