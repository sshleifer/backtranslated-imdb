OK, that was one of the most serious excuses 4 a movie I've ever had the misfortune to look at. Like all the other Olsen twins, except for the possible new york minute, this movie had no story, holes of holes, disgusting clutter, and bad shots even !!!!!!!!! if you have not guessed yet I HATE Marie Kate and Ashley !!!!!! The only reason I looked at that was that I was really bored and nothing else worked. I wonder if the twins will stop making the same stereotypical films where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic location and save in the meantime getting the help of two cute guys who wash right over them. What could be the least would be to have a guy 4 1 or fall on both the same guy. The plot in this story was so stupid and simply simple. even a child could see the flaws in her. Maybe he should break up and start making films individually or maybe he's filming with a different story. Anyone who liked this movie was not an offensive - either really bad, really artificial or did not see a really good movie. or maybe they are very intelligent and have only bad cinematic choices. anyway I would not recommend this film to the worst nemesis for a good cinematic experience. The only good thing 4 is that some ribbed laughter in the pathetic attempts to cool down. if you look at laughing, it's hilarious. Practically I give 0 or less.
