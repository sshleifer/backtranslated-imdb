Another British cinema flag. Real waste offered here once again. I can not understand (and I'm British) why this has ever been done above the tops, patriotic nonsense. Eight years marks you from the end of the Second World War! Other commentators here remarked on the seamless editing and seamless use of archive images. This is very poorly observed. The pictures in the archive are abundant. The aircraft model is linked to the yarns of "action scenes", such as so many creatures for children in the wind. The usual sequences of the camera map tattooed to the film make us assume that we are attracted to the whole event in Malta. Guinness must have the worst performing ever. Stunning dogfight scenes are laughing. Hawkins throws us all to death in the area of ​​the map rooms. Ealing made many wonderful movies. This is not clear one of them. He should have stayed away from this unconvincing rot!
