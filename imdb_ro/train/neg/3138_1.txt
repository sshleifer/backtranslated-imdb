I see people write about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The act was sub-par at best. She made a lot of money because the teenage girls visited the movie seven times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money from? Anyway, I wanted to find out more about Titanic; why it sank, what went through the minds of many people; maybe even a little conspiracy. Does anyone realize that some people did not go aboard the ship, because there was a fire on board just before it took off? No, not because all you see is a rich girl who falls for a poor boy and paints it naked (did that scorn, at least to advise that the movie is stupid?). I cried during a scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that filled the ship. It looked like swimming pool water! Do I think this movie made all that money and could not make water from the ocean look real? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh band played while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor went over to the "Nothing to Do" department.
