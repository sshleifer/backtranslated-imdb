After the disappointment of "Conflict Final," the series hits the rock-bottom with this very low entry. At least the third movie attempted (unsuccessfully) to continue Damien's story, while it only rehashes and copied ideas from "Omen" (animals fear Antichrist, a man's death is very similar to death photographer in the first film). But what seemed exciting and creative seemed only here. And the little girl just looks like a spoiled kid.
