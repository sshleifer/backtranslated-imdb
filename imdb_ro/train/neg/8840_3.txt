Here's the perfect example of what you do not have to do when you have a great idea. This is the problem is not it? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but its scenario and execution have no real substance. You should start from the beginning and then draw your emotions, interest and invest in characters. This movie does not have what it takes to take off and support the flight, and from here. First you do not really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can refer to, that is, it's not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's supposed to be normal people in a stressful situation. They are not credible in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a chef is gum, frowns and looks intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean what is this? Looks like she's in the toilet or something like that. I loved him in the re-animator and the way he played the intense / neurotic medical genius, he was unappreciated for money. But not for that, he tries too much to compensate, showing so intense and edge, but in a non-gentle yet gentle manner, it's not natural, I'm surprised he did not dislodge his maxilla during the filming. The film is mainly on life support, it barely has a pulse and kept me waiting for something that would never come.
