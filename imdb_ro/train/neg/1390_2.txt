I am a big fan of B5, being caught only at the end of the third season. We have followed closely all the previous seasons when he was syndicated, concluding that he was one of the best-thought-provoking archers ever to hit television. Even the filling episodes were interesting. Also, the movies were well produced and fun as anything else to hit the theaters. What brings us to the "River of Souls". Naturally, after seeing everything, we had great expectations. Martin Sheen seems to act in a Ed Wood movie, rather than a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself could have looked good in the shape of a contour, even made a story on board. However, she obviously suffers when the time comes to fill this notion into a two-hour film. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the absence of a compelling storyline. There are places where they obviously did not have time and have improvised dialogue to fill the story. Had he made this season regularly, he would have been among the worst of the episodes.
