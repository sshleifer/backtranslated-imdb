Well, I'm going with another B movie industry. It's pretty sad to see some bad movies, but I do not care if a B industry or C industry produces the movie. Show some effort in your work. Characters are very bad. The actor is not in this (surprise), but a plot. How can a knit team confess two soldiers with them and then go as if nothing had happened? What bothered me was how the writer even threw a scene in the rest of the members, joking about the beauty of the doctor's ass. Save me.
