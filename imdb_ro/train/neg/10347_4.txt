I just saw Adam with four sons for the first time, and the thing that hit me was that I think the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same age as the four boys in the movie. Warner Baxter, in the portrait of Adam Stoddard, spoke about the same values ​​and family traditions that you had heard from the 26th President, without some strange aspects of the TR character. <br /> <br /> Like TR, all Stoddard sons serve in World War I, in this case, although the youngest only loses one eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a beautiful female goes into this family and breaks things up? This is Susan Hayward's job here. In one of her prominent prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amateur girl who marries a son, has an affair with another, and starts playing for the third. He is an early precursor to that part that later brought an Oscar to "I Want to Live". I suppose that, with such a strong style of decoration as Theodore Roosevelt, and with the portrait of Warner Baxter, everyone is afraid to tell the father what's going on. Their sons and governor Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a little stupid. Bergman is presented to us as a governor employed by Baxter and Fay Wray's wife for their children. Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial reversals in business. Bergman has to give up. He returns to France and, after years, returns to the family when the children grow up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not believe that kids now need a governor. Hayward is right when she is confronted with her that the children have not brought her back. Normally, Bergman would have had to make his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous commentators said that a quarter to one-third of the movie we were edited. Maybe that could be the reason for the many holes we have. It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have made another movie together in the fifties when Hayward was at her height and Bergman had just made a comeback. Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam had four sons. And I'm willing to think that much of Ingrid's been left on the floor.
