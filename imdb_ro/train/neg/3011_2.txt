I was very excited to see this movie, anticipating a visual trip on the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, containing the kind of wisdom that resembles "Rivers and Trends." However, that's not what I received. Instead, I have a rather uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature. Which is clearly a rather unorthodox statement. The photographer is opposed to the aesthetic qualities of his images and the alleged "ethical" duty he has for workers who occasionally surround the images along the outskirts. And frankly, the images were generally not impressive. And according to this "artist," the ladder is the basis for what makes something beautiful. In every respect, a stupid movie. For people who would like to feel better about their ecological awareness ... but not for someone who would like to think about the complexity of the surrounding issues.
