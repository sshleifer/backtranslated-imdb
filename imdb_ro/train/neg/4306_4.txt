There is a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry I'm so weird, but it's the truth. Too bad he did not do a nude. At least it would have made this misery tolerable. We see chicken trunks, but it's not anywhere near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? Man looks like shit! "Consequence" is the ordinary movie you would expect. The story had potential. It's like he had good ideas, but he did not know how to execute them. Cinema is simply terrible. Ugly! The director is uninspired, and the end result is a gentle thriller with twisted blades and washed actors. Lola Gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap, glamorous way but does not even save the "Consequence" of being garbage and not funny trash, just old garbage.
