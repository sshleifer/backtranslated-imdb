God, what the hell happened here ?! I'm not gonna say that anymore, but what kind of movie back is that? Dubbing in this way is the worst than doubling in King Kong vs Godzilla, Linda Miller was supposed to be the worst actress in her and the costumes are really cheese. It's a bastard named Dr.Who gets hackers to build a gorilla robot that has the same power as King Kong, but when this robot collapses, he builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (when Linda Miller becomes annoying) he makes Kong his slave, but everything goes well and King Kong escapes. Then, Dr.Who sends the robot after him. Later, when I was watching the movie, I had a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns began to twitch. As we stood by the misery of watching the DVD while playing. We hope that the madness in the movie will end by the end of the fight. The end must be a very bad one because he could show Kong back to the dinosaurs fighting again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie under any circumstances or if you want ... beware of disappointment you will receive.
