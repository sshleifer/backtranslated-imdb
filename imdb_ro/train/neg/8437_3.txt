As a great fan of David Mamet's films and songs, especially his first gaming house movie, which also played Joe Mantegna, I was expecting extraordinary things in this film. Instead, I found myself annoyed by the superficiality of the film and the lack of credibility. The racist raids are thrown around them, without any feeling or understanding behind them, hoping to create a racial tension that, for me, has never materialized. Identity is completely re-evaluated and people become "heroes" without apparent reason. Because of his oath taken as a policeman, the main character often refuses to perform a relatively small action that would not hurt anyone and save lives, yet he does another very violent and very illegal action, but then refuses the minor action. In addition, an incredibly subtle plot involving a man who killed his family is introduced only for the sake of a plot plot that was just published with the dawn writings, and the cop's reaction to that event spans a way credulity that exceeds all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after I waited another exciting thriller at David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.
