OK, obviously PPL thought this was a good movie in 1955. I'm afraid of the fools I still believe ... Absolute garbage. The story is just. .. ridiculous. Characters are absurd caricatures - but this movie is not meant to be satirized, I'm sure it's a serious drama, is not it? Dean and others are too good for their parts. People say Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he played his role as he could. His character must be 16 or 17 years old. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made the movie. Seeing him agonizing and throwing small beats like a four-year-old boy ... his pathetic. Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the first scenes from the police station where crying and crying are very unconvincing. It sets an unprecedented precedent for the movie ... and for the rest of it, you feel like you cried every time one of these badly acting emotional scenes happens. Perhaps it was good for her time, but, indeed, his tangle. It must have been just hype about Dean's death, which overwhelmed the reputation of this film.
