If only to avoid this type of movie in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment, but it does not tell a cogent story. You may feel virtuous for sitting through it because it touches so many IMPORTANT issues, but it does it for no reason whatsoever. The visitor has no new perspectives (if one does not appear while the mind wanders, as will happen invariably during this unnecessary movie). One would be better to spend an eye on the window a growing tree. <br /> <br />
