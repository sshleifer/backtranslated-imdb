Tarzan's latest film, with Johnny Weissmuller (who is more than a year old after "Tarzan and Huntress"), is bad, despite all the evidence that can be added to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell from Weissmuller, filming in the beautiful landscape in Mexico with a top star of that country (Andrea Palma) and the multi-award winning cinema Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to make the score. Although it may cost less for films abroad, it seems to be more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids such as Aquatania and impressive decorations for all scenes related to Balu's temple mostly outside, built on steep cliffs.) Kurt Neumann should have remained director, instead of Robert Florey, which gives him a very slow pace. Neumann did a good job with Tarzan and the Amazons, Tarzan and Leopard Woman and Tarzan and Huntress, and finished his career with the classic "The Fly" a year before his death; while Florey became television director after a career of some remarkable films. If Weissmuller seems tired, the chimpanzee who plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a stumbling stumbling blockbuster song (which has a Caribbean air in a location that was supposed to be Africa and shot in Mexico!) Bored and determined by the dubious taste, was a good farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.
