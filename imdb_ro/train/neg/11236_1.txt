As a Kalamazoo resident, with a love for the city, I was expecting to see this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the action and production values ​​are not bad, the scenario is terrible, the scenario is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing. The main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. I can not believe how regressive it is in women's opinion. The writer lived under a cliff? <br /> <br /> Although I liked to see my beloved city on the big screen, I would not suggest this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is embarrassment for the city named after.
