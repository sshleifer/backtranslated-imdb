Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for NYC high speed rollers, but the heat is active and can not find a safe location. He bets Skystone columnist Sky Masterson that Sky can not make a first missionary, Sarah Brown, to go to dinner with him. Sky is facing the challenge, but both men have some surprises in the store. This is one of the fifty expensive MGM music in splashy colors, with big sets, loud music, higher roles than life and performance to fit; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like a kind of stuff I can not do. My main problem with these types of movies is simply music. I love all sorts of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway shows songs in swing time with pah-pah-tah-dah, which never ends at the end of each bar four, I'm not my tea what do you have. This was written by tag team Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on some of Damon Runyon's stories), and while the plot is kind enough, the songs are poor. Two Blaine numbers, for example, are identical, useless, do not advance the plot and the grate on the ears (and are also flagrant misogyny if you bother doing so). There are only two memorable songs, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you would expect) and Sit Down, Rockin 'The Boat (well done by Kaye), but you have to stay for two hours. The winner of the film is a young Brando that delivers a thoughtful, relaxed performance; he sings pretty well and even dances a little and is equal to Simmons always interesting. The succession in which the two escapes to Havana for the night is a welcome respite due to Noo Yawk's noise, agitation and murder. Fans of musicals can dig that, but in my opinion a musical has to do more than just shoot the stage show.
