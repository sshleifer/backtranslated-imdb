As soon as it touches a screen, it destroys all the intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of its producers I have to say that it does not fall into any category of known films, deserves a new name! It's a "neurological drama"! It affects and depresses each neuron within a person's brain. The closest thing you'll ever get a stroke without actually suffering one. He runs you without words, all your members become deceived, your mouth falls open and it stays like this, and the most strange symptom of all is that you wake up wishing to go blind and deaf. a kind of "movie". The only word that comes to my mind just after I finish my aunt is EXTREME !!!!!!
