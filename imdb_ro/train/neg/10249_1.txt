What can I say about this movie, other than "you do not see it." I waited and waited and WAITED for someting (or whatever) to happen and just did not come. Look amazing as two people walk while setting the recording for most of the screen filling in a single movie. What are you doing? Solve a mystery? I collect the clues? Perhaps it's hard to say. At the end of the movie, after many radio signals are decoded (unreadable on a kind of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the stretch is finally revealed and thrown aside as quickly as possible. Some foreigners want to return to their utopia of origin and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I think they do not like to share wealth). I think they have finished filming and have seen their 35-minute work or art (garbage!) And they decided they let the editing crew become a 88-minute feature film. Look at your own danger, it's not even funny, because it's so bad, it's bad.
