Here are some examples about which Pat Robertsons dubiously claimed "the relatively good story" of predictions. In the comments he responded largely from the January 2 edition of Christian Broadcasting's The 700 Club, which he predicted as "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass killing" in the United States in " the second half of 2007, "Pat Robertson's host praised that he has a" relatively good history "on previous predictions. But a review of Robertson's 2006 New Year's predictions undermines this statement. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will strengthen." WRONG * "Fall elections will be inconclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave Republicans responsible." WRONG The war in Iraq will end successfully. We will start troop withdrawal before the end of this year. WAY WRONG Moreover, as reported in an Associated Press article on January 3, Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions: The radio broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win reelection. Bush won 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would have a victory after victory in his second term. He said the proposals for social security reform will be approved from the start! <br /> <br /> He claims to speak directly with the god ... If God has a sense of humor that looks at Pat, to make himself a fool of himself again and again ..
