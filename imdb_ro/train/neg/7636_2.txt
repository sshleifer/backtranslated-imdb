I wanted to believe in this film, after the only form of mass comedy that this country recognizes, is slapstick and stereotypes. Of course, it went completely elsewhere - to be cool and nervous - and we went out the other side with little to show for her. I bet a single little one looks like that. I know SL did it. None of the main characters have the comic commissions to take it out. Even Danny K had a better moment. Actually, I'm serious. Each time I introduced a little character, I always thought, "Darn, this person should have been the ruler!" Independent does not mean that work in the room must be horrible. Black and White did nothing for this film - in fact, with such a flat dialogue, it affected it even more by bringing boredom into relief. Also black and white was not clear. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Pretty weird I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition was gorgeous - maybe that's why the deficiencies in this movie go out in my mind. I think Corne (who was funnier than the one who says nothing before) talked about this film and not about David - you see and you will understand. I bet the guys who organized Oppikoppi were terrified. It might be thought that nothing is happening at all. I have the feeling that she could have been filmed in somebody's back garden. I know ordinary guys who have more fun, refined, and delusional conversations than any of these comics. The guy they coupled with the end was OK, though. Comedia Guess SA will remain in the Stone Age a little longer. Good laborers.
