The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar renunciation of "No Animal Wounded ..." (registered trademark of AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after was tied to the eye, the horse was forced to jump up to death from the top of a rock for a chance in the Jesse James movie (1939). Undoubtedly, the atrocious act kills the entire entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose someone could say that at least the horse did not die in vain because it was the beginning of the public awakening painful and terrible pain caused to the animals for the glory of the film but I can not feel that if the poor animal has a choice, it would have been the way he would have taken it!
