I can not believe that the Indian film industry still has such a slag as Waqt's. To begin with, the story is totally implausible? the ruined son is thrown out of the family home, so to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He goes ahead to win a national talent contest by making some jumping in front of a group of judges (I honestly do not joke here). Meanwhile, his father dies of lung cancer, but keeps a secret from his son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous for seeing his new nephew and also to make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> The actor is confidently worthy of his hamminess? no effort has been made to try to act convincingly on any of the main players in this movie. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by real world concerns. To be honest, the main losers when such terrible movies are made are intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be venerated as gods by those people who have only a blind faith in Bollywood.
