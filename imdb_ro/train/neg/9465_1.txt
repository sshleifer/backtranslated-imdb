From the direction of action, direction, scripture and art, this film is simply badly conceived, and money would have been better spent on footwear for landmine victims. When I became so sad she had to fill up the film for children with sexual inconvenience to keep their parents' attention. Dr. Suess rolls in his grave right now, which with "dirty" ho "" SHIT "and false erection scenes etc. He is ashamed to change his name to Suess to bring parents to bring his children, tossing profanities to try teenagers and some sad parents who will not watch the movie with their child if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more much greed. Compare this to classic children's movies and we can get a disturbing vision of the world turns into. These guys should stay with MTV videos. How on Earth this movie got> 400 votes, while a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless the family of directors)
