I usually support independent art and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone because their efforts are valuable ... but this film just moves away from any limits and tolerance! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the real-life horror movie you've ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2. Think of some great arts appealing to the movie's DVD of this movie ... and a promising plot ... <br /> <br /> 3. VOILÃ€! you have ZOMBIE NATION. See it only if you really do not have anything better to do. Nothing is better.
