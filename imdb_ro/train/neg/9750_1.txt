The film, a universal launch of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring account of the theory of decomposing the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy," and then sending it back to a "target area." There is no explanation why this is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by bastard actor Bryant Haliday, Devil Doll) thinks it's something to do with him and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell Ronald Allen. , lives. During an experiment, before the Dutch scientist Lembach (Gordon Heinz) noticed, the car fails because of sabotage, so he was "designed" by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to take revenge. Of course, he is mistaken and looks like a "pork steak" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this new power found, he manages to hit Cockney idiots, a security guy called Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab head, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to break a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. Ultimately, however, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempts to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. On the whole, a completely useless film without any message. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color films you'll ever see.
