I hired this movie three years ago and still seems to me the worst movie ever made. I do not think we've ever finished. It's worse than a home movie made by a high school student. I remember that they made a retrospective in 1970 and in retrospect was a man with polo shirt, sunglasses and a new SUV like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember). I do not understand how he could have said this in the 1970s. He may have had a cell phone, I do not remember, it was horrible. I went back to the video store and asked why they even took the movie and if I could take my time back from my life. So far, it's the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some of the worst.
