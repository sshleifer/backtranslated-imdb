Well, since I've seen the songs from 1 to 3, I can honestly say they should never have done. Everything from the sticky, and tactical score for a very bad action, dare someone to look at it and do not get bored of their minds. I mean, Parts 1-3 keep the strong vibration on Damion's plot, but without him around it is not the same thing. Of course, by the end of the third part I was a little tired of the story line, but it was a good closing at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for a party 4. Even if it was there it could have done a job much better than this sh * t had to sit through, lol. It's been an hour and a half of my life that I will never see again.
