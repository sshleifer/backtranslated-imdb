Sunshine is a European import established in Hungary between the 1880s and 1980s, is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name translates literally into Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then it is prosperous, moves upward, changes its name, and hopes to assimilate into the Hungarian society so that successive generations can advance professionally. The story is spoken through the eyes of the eldest son of each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who have missed WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life is not working well. Sunshine is appreciated as an artistic success, but it is a missed opportunity. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice stories and news stories. The family "plot" lurches from a predictable event. Habsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] in the next, with little continuity, depth or detail. The theme of Jewish assimilation is unfocused, and important sub-themes (the "secret" journal and family philosophy) that could have given the character and credibility of the family are left to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers provide a continuity of generations using common themes of incest / infidelity. Ralph Fiennes has brilliance, but his performance is far from winning the prize. The "3 for 1" distribution format is a distraction for viewers and feels more like a cheap cinema trick than a good theater. Sunshine is basically a Hungarian material "History Channel". She has the appearance of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with something about sex. <br /> <br />
