I recently looked at Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in him. I did not, horrible. Cartoon Network tends to make its audiences enjoyable, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in the slightest form. The scenario is incredibly predictable, and the runners are not gags at all. Children will love it, and that's about it. Now, that does not mean it's all bad. The original opening theme was actually quite appealing, but for some reason they took the skeleton and destroyed the figurine with a figurative aluminum face. It's a shame, because it was really one of the best things she had for her. Some characters might be very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well, but they are too unidimensional. Then, again, this makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is a bit too fast, too. Episodes are too busy, leaving little time for smart writing. This is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings. Instead, the rapid pace will prevent children from losing interest, and that's really the whole target audience. In general, the show looks very good on paper, but it just does not make it fun or interesting. This is a show I want to like, but I'm incapable of it. There is just as much potential that is not being realized. Children will enjoy, but that's all about it.
