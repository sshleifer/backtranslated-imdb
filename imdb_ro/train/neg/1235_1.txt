I was really looking forward to seeing the Planet of the Monkeys, but it was a huge disappointment. Settings and masks are great, but this is the only good thing about the movie. All the other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he's just in the movie, pointing stupid. The other actors are also not very good. But the worst point of all is the story. It's absolutely ridiculous! For example: monkeys are lying on the ground, but people do not attack them, do not wait until they are back! This is just an example for the bad story, but it would take too long to tell everyone.
