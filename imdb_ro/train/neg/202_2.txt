It's not the sound of the bees, that's the effect of watching this extremely long, extremely boring and ill-action movie. How did I ever achieve through 3 Â½ hours without falling asleep, I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 morons that can not be spoken talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was dead. This is even worse, if that is possible. > I really have to be a masochist if I could watch the whole movie without stopping it ... or killing someone.
