As we navigate through the channels, we found this film with its promising synopsis. We were worried about the flat-rate action and the formal story. We found amusing exploding car scenes, incredible pulls and sets that collapsed with the weight of the tire and cardboard foam. What was even more hilarious was to see all the recycled scenes in the "Dante's Peak", where the church front falls on the school bus, shop fronts move away from the main street, the tread crashes, and the red truck accelerates down the alley because the bricks fall on it. It was a good, though unintentional laugh, and lets the viewer wonder if it was originally intended as a low budget haven for disastrous films.
