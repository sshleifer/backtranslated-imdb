This is a film of tired but strange childhood clich√©s. Is there a Nazi wizard master who performs holy-related experiments in the basement? Oh please! <br /> <br /> The goal for a late sense of horror and fear, the general impression of the film is that of a very immature vision of fear. Although I have no anticipated expectations, I was left with: a Buffy old Xander and a monkey face heroine who does not seem to know how to act. He said that Adrienne Barbeau has just met in the much loved "Canibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death". Camera and editing adds to the general impression of blades.
