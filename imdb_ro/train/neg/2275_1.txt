A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abra los Ojos, but this time with a living mask, breathing like a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we urge Tom Cruise's heartless performance as usual with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his character, but we are usually given a character to keep our interest. His naked position denies any erotic energy that might have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. There is an exercise involving the use of masks to release the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body means language. Cruise's masking painfully accentuates his lack of actor. See the original Amenabar in 1997 Open your eyes!
