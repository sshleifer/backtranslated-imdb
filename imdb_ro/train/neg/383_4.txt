No One's Sleeps plot line is not a bad idea and the subject is quite interesting. But while watching this movie, I said aloud: "These producers are going to the trouble to find good locations, the lighting is good, the makeup and the hair are good ... why the sound is so bad?" Throughout the movie, the sound was echoed, falsified, and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. There is good action in this movie and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, along with other actors, would have deserved to make this film a great budget movie. I can not reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, you are more committed to good sound. The sound is as much as a part of a movie as the image and it is worth doing well. He could have won 6.
