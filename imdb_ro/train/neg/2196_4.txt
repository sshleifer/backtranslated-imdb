The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the finer films of low budget use since the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how such a repulsive scenario could have been written without the intention of self-parody. The themes repeatedly expressed by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by cars, I-V and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes. The hues of the Helena, which was not evaluated. Genisms are abundant and irritating like an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and unbelievable, and the act is just OK (but not consistent). Why did I give 4 movies to this movie? Because some believe they have entered it clearly. I do not know exactly which point really tries to make the film, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually exaggerated and gross horror (without the blood and intestines that the public is expecting today). Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are not really any heroes in this movie, and none of the characters are particularly enjoyable. All this is considered a rather painful and disturbing look at the beginning of the 1960s, American pop sexuality, from a living woman's point of view despite the missing body after it had to be a fatal car accident. Her boyfriend threatens to squeeze a fresh body of high quality and force her to continue living with him. She is, of course, not plussed by all this and forced to fear a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. There are also some vague references to the 1950/60 clich√©s about the evil of science that unfolds amok. Recommended for B students and graduate students in gender studies. O / w is not recommended.
