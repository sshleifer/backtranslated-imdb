It's a poor film, but I have to give it to lead actress in this ... Francine Forbes. She seemed to behave the least, and I personally thought she was pretty. It's a shame that it only appears in another movie in the database. Besides, the film is full of death scenes and false deaths. People are stabbed and they enjoy 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to watch horror movies, I recommend this.
