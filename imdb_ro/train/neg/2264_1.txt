To preface this review, I must say that I was, I think, a little curious about this movie. However, I probably would not have seen it if I did not have the slightly twisted arm. my opinion, this film shows how depraved man can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about this Springer phenomenon is not the kind of people who behave in the "Jerry Springer Show" as they do (which is inherently reprehensible in itself) but that many people are so curious and enthusiastic to look at them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose it includes me as far as it is true). If we do not glorify this kind of behavior (as some might say), at least we can subtle our minds and / or despise ourselves to this kind of behavior. But quite soapbox (kind of). Here's a thin one: the movie has a R rating and, while it's just worth it (I looked at some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel that a NC-17 (the tip of another hatter reviewer) might be a bit more appropriate for a huge sexual content (a cynic could comment that the movie was just a big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The story is very bizarre, linking together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of angry stereotypical blacks who will appear on various Springer shows. In the end, the film leaves one with a certain determination - and Springer's rhetoric about the need to see the real world (obviously as seen through his show). I agree with him there - it is important to know how the world really is, so we can seek to make positive changes. Having said that, let me just tell you - a pretty bad picture of the world in a new version or news, to see this, but not to make good money to support that kind of sensationalism and perhaps training , which Springer is trying to give us.
