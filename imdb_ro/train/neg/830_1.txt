I really do not understand all these positive user comments. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's her fault, but the directors. He somehow managed to do everything artificially shown; their action, the idea, the make-up, everything. The star I give is just for the idea behind the movie, which was badly executed. <br /> <br /> Do not watch shit, go to a Fellini, Woody Allen or David Lynch.
