Indeed, I can not believe I spent $ 5 for this movie. I'm a huge zombie fanatic and I thought the movie could not be that bad. Had zombies in her right? I was wrong! To be honest the movie had moments ... I thought it was bad when the guy got his head broken, but that was about it. On the whole, I think it would be more enjoyable to slip a slide with empty pockets into a vinegar, then watch this movie again. The movie could have been better if I could see some tits, but I had to watch trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware ... if you are not in masochism.
