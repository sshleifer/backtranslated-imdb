I never thought the Yashraj movie standards would have been degraded to such an extent! The film has a nonsense story that does not attract any interest. Saif acted over. Kareena has improved her figure, but she is not a good act anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. I can say that the role was not good. A lot of cheapness is complete. Asked if it should have been the "comedy part" of the film. Just because the latest movies were floppies, does Yashraj movie have to do this kind of garbage? It has a history of many good movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the film.
