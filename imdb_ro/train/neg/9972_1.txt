CHILD PROBLEM is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. This junior can drive the grandfather's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can put a room in the fire! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** I give it.
