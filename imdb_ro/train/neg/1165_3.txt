I will keep this short, as I know I do not have to say too much. "Alive" is a strange movie that obviously appeals to some, but it seemed shocking almost at first. The film did very little to make any of the characters happy and the story has sometimes become so complicated that we have lost all interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found Kitamura's "Alive" just as an extremely dull drama, disguised as a science fiction action movie. I felt like I was sucked in watching this film, based on its exciting premise and the art of uber-interesting cover. My suggestion? Take it with Kitamura's much-loved "Versus" effort or "Godzilla: Final Wars" in 2004. <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, the good movie of man thinking, but it certainly was not. It was a moment in which I actually cared for a single event that takes place in this film too hard to read, dialogue. If you want to talk about something ... you're talking about boring.
