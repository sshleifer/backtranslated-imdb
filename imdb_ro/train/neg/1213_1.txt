I can not believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger are involved in this trash! The script is so badly written, and so poorly directed (so the same person) that it's hard to find more single-dimensional characters in a movie. Dialogues are so terrible that this so-called thriller has laughed at some madmen who entered the theater. Configuration is difficult, inviting you to think that you are going to watch a refreshing thriller and suddenly it will prove to be the worst film of persecution. Bassinger's character is so stupid he actually stops crying to God "where are you"? so people after it can follow, and then take a leak !!!! Then it seems to have entered the smallest wood in the world, that is, run all over, and the killers have never lost track, and that is happening in the middle of the night. It really makes me wonder, is that really the best Hollywood writers can find that they are spending millions of people producing it.
