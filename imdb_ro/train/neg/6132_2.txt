As a child, my friends and all of us, I thought Gymkata was the most violent and bloody film ever made. I'm not sure who started the rumor. Probably born out of frustration for 10-year-olds who are not allowed to see for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a movie with late night cables and as a result I managed to recover the lost time. I've probably seen scenes from this dreadful apology for a movie over a dozen times and can always see it from 1-2 seconds of the screen. However, besides the forced couples of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad doubling, the rigid dialogue and the difficult story of the story, the film has some things for him. With all that's bad about the visual film, the sound is actually pretty fun. Never before has a shot or a kick with so much force and volume! The sounds of kung-fu, preserved, are frightening, but the slow and sloping music and the scene of almost 5 minutes slow down are really strange. The hunter through the city of demented villagers, blood-thirsty, is not even tense as it is irritating, and there are plenty of percussion and evil extras that just look at the camera and make waves to do this little fun-fun. Could it be headed for cult-class status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
