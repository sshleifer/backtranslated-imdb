ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despised. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, it will most likely increase psychotic, depressed or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how he wanted to keep your privacy. Rich rich, rich girl, Ashley Olson, just wants to stay alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a reluctant and said, "I want to be alone." How much does the ET do this little girl? Does ET have anything better to report? I bet there are a lot of people who really do not care what color they were on their birthday cake and balloons. By the way, I have never heard that Anna Nichole has ever won any of these cases in court over her will and her inheritance. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard, and Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
