"Indian Funeral Land": If these three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple, with a young daughter and a young son, moves to a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery - and, after a hike, an ancient Indian burial temple. It seems that Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind having a pet for a pet. The same can be done for the dead - if you do not mind having a zombie killed around the house. Throw into a crowded two-lane noise, accelerate the big platforms if you want an old neighbor and a child who really does not have enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what's going on out there - a messy, illogical mess , which, with all fairness, offers (for example, "Maximum Overdrive," which King also directed). But there are also many better ones (such as "Salem Lot", "Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
