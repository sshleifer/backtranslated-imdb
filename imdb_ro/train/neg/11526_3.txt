I liked the previous movie from Ittenbach that I saw, "Burning Moon." But while the movie was rather bleak and unpleasant, "Premutos" seems to play more for laughing. While Ittenbach's admirable made this film free of money in his free time (and the documentary DVD deserves to see this), I have constantly woken up fighting not to advance quickly to the next gore scene. Sure, it's gore and if that's all you want, then go and enjoy yourself. But be warned: there is an excessive amount of agonizing comedy and boring story exposures. Many compare this to Peter Jackson's films, especially to "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson has done in a similar budget to "Bad Taste," it's clear that Ittenbach has nothing Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and abundant effects and to get the most limited resources - but it's not worth the money I paid)
