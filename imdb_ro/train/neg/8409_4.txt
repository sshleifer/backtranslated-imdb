Eddie Murphy for Best Supporting Actor ??? What insult Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this movie as a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? That's what? <br /> <br /> This film is opposed to CHICAGO or almost any other recent music. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Jennifer Hudson's singing and high performance, I would have given it ZERO. And I've never seen the scene, so I do not make the typical Broadway versus Hollywood rap version.
