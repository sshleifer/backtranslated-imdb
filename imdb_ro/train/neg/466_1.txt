How can I best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? stupid stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And that's just for the direction. Story? I think there's a story. Two silly blondes are looking for a job after a plane collapses into a golf course. They are confused with an "assassin quit the world" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "mobsters". One thinks "pull it out" means a meeting, and the other one becomes the minor actor he's dreaming about. And, of course, the turtle turtle reserve, which I build with the casino earnings. Sounds I like all this could be funny? Guess again. He's trying to make him funny, but he does not. The shooting sequences are not well done. I've seen better shots in Hong Kong movies. The visuals are an average for a movie from the late 80's. But the problem is that it's a 2007 movie. It's never worth to ever forget about it. He still does not beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie in the early 80's as the worst movie of all time, but again the film is in its own class. "F"
