... not to live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century. "A river passes through it" surely is a movie well done from a cineas point of view. Beautiful landscapes, Redford works well. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). I'm sorry for the narrator / author, who is like a dry, narrow character, like his father, a preacher. Being led, without leading his own life, he is allowed to supervise his brother, who is also in the house in the small city environment, losing his life. The author does not even get close to his brother's motivations, but at least he realizes he does not have the slightest amount of killing / fun. Everything is, it's fishing with a fly, where it follows even as old his father's style. The end is not surprising, it's from the beginning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
