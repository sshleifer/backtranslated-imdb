This movie should never have been done. Frankly, I must admit that before I saw that I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress, though she has made a lot of films in the Netherlands, and the young who took the main part is a TV personage with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main role I've seen recently in Flight of Bride, and although the movie is better, she only convinces me. To start with the story, I did not read the novel on which it is based, but the scenario underlying the film is something that could have been done with the minds of the children who spent the day on a rainy Sunday afternoon, someone from the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing was the excessive dialogue, most of the time being spoken out loud. My listening goes to the cameraman, at least trying to do something out of it. It is a pity that the film is terribly edited, if not, some scenes were certainly more credible.
