The Thumb idea is not such a winner the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as the Thumb War for several reasons. Above all, I think Mr. Oedekerk had much less to collaborate with Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the Titanic movie has not (yet?) A cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made to resonate with the audience. In ThumbTanic, holes are filled with jokes that do not seem to be related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine is not clean during the "jump at the end of the ship" scene - is not funny. You're just thinking about yourself, "Did something get out of my original movie?" There have been too many such unhelpful jokes (cf arachnid). Unlike this, sending the astonishing ship designer made sense and was fun. Also, it was very funny to send bloke to the movie, who wanted to go "faster" like a maniac running around asking * everything * to be "faster", including sinking the ship and himself being the first to He died. These kinds of jokes meant something in the titanic context and gave meaningful humor to Thumbtanic. "Finger", faces and voices are still funny. CG posts and sets and animations are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves loneliness will not work, this movie still keeps you amused and giggling all the way.
