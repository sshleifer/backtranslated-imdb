I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon, and I do not see how anyone can stand by this piece of garbage. It's not funny at all and takes your IQ. down a few notches. I know this movie is for children, but that does not mean writers should take their intelligence to agree. I bet the writers sit around a big wooden table and think that a) The word "poop" is a big laugh. b) A 4-foot child can climb a 10 meter high basketball net. c) Children should always fight gunmen with armed robbers, as the kidnappers will fall for anything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat the so-called "sword ninja". One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the weakest suburban "band" in the world that could not destroy anyone. Perhaps the boys at MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Do not worry about this excuse for a movie.
