This movie made me crazy, because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I've been living in Iowa for 29 years and I know people do not have a Southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does the meta and I do not know the real plot or what the movie implies. It has a lot of graphic use of the drugs in it and it's really insulting, so you see that these people use meta like sugar. I lost my brother to eat it, and this movie makes me sick for my stomach because she's glamorizing the drug. The movie shows that it's cool to use the drug, but I was happy at the end of the year when the guy almost made it over the state line. I also know that most women who have a traumatic rape do not want to make love with their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I suggest a movie about drugs.
