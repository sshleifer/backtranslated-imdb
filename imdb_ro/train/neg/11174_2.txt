Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Leoni tea? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth is wet. I gave up all to watch this movie on the cable. 30 minutes I had trouble staying awake. 60 minutes and hit the recording button and I fell asleep. He finished watching her the next morning. He should not have bothered you. What a loss of great distribution and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Living Day ..." Clean up your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue is horrible. Continuity nonexistent. Room activity could have been done with a Super 8 handle and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
