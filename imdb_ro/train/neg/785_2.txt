This absurd and unmistakable movie is certainly the most mistaken version of Hamlet ever to get on the screen. Branagh's approach to material can only be described as vulgar; going as long as Ophelia's appearance in a straight jacket, with Fortinbras' army suddenly emerging on the horizon (pointing a lot like the climax of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail") when the palace is apparently guarded by Francisco alone the non-Shakespearean cry of "ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" before being shot), and a number of camoes that came back in the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Kate Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> makes sense in the context in which it unfolds. And Branagh is not concerned with such textual subtleties as the ambiguous nature of the relationships between Hamlet and Olphelia, treating the audience in a nude sexual vulgar scene between the couple who throws any ambiguity right in the stained glass window. <br /> <> The untrained text allows Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic play: several records by Kenneth Branagh. This is never as apparent as in the discourse "How All Opportunities Inform Against Me", which ends in the first half of the ninety-hour film (at least that's what it feels), trying to play a dramatic crescendo on the line Gone With Wind is "I will never be hungry anymore." This may serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the discourse: when I saw the movie in the theater, I leaned on my comrade and shook "the great moments with Mr. Hamlet." Branagh saves the most funny and tasteless moment for the last moment when he tries to stop the movie Olivier and Claudius' death with justice, in that Hamlet jumps from a high tower to the monarch, pushing him with a sword. Branagh's Dana makes the king throwing a heroically seemingly magical rapier from the palace to pass through Claudius' heart with a superhero bull's eye. The only thing that saved the moment to be unbearably crazy was that it was so funny. While this movie has been praised in some places as a serious representation of the tragedy, it is in reality nothing but a display of a talented once talented film being overcome by its own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has only a few unintentional laughter and a horrifying look at the ego of a man who is not controlled.
