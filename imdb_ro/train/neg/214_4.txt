Given that this movie had a serious and successful launch campaign, I would have expected something to deserve the fuzz ... from the opening scene (where the two brothers "console" each other sensitively to each other , goes down quickly ... nothing to attract attention, not a wonderful thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (some minor exceptions but artificial is at its peak). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not analyze any of the two in depth (the mind that a possible excuse of the producers, saying that they are targeting a subtle film, would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial is the same thing ...). The too curious viewers will not get any scene interesting ... at this time, who could have saved a movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things might be said ... but please watch the movie yourself I ... I'm selfish and I would like as many people to lose about 1 1/2 hours of their lives ... as I did :(
