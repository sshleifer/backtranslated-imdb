The only redemption was the small part of Larry Miller. It seemed like the movie was trying too much to be "something about Mary," but I did not even like the movie and still did not respect these standards. The actor playing Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of the character Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father seemed to be trying too much to be Randy Quaid's character in National Lampoon's Vacation.
