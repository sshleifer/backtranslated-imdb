The city girl, Meg Tilly, receives a terrible phone from her mother and, of course she is shaken, returns home to the countryside of her family just to face a mystery: why are all the inhabitants of the house acting bizarre and disturbing ways? Radiation Thriller, with the ability to do ecology, has residents of small towns that (ridiculously) include two women who look at each other willingly in a public place, and Tim Matheson gets an oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The image is too foolish for words, scattering Tilly's mischief and silence on the trash, forcing himself into a corner he can not hope to get out of. Some of Thomas Del Ruth's cinema is good (especially a fire sequence inside a garage), though he is disappointed with the scrappy edition - and a pretty bitter finish. Simplistic scenario has an unusual surprise and no originality in the sleeve. * 1/2 from ****
