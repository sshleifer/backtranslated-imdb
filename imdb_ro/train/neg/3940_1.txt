This movie is a joke, and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to quit this as a Modest Blaise movie. If you have trouble sleeping then it means you rent this movie. The men they call an actress who is supposed to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Perhaps it could be used as a support for hats at the bottom of a real movie. Seventy-five minutes of nothing I do not thank you, who ever invented the button fast forward. If you see this movie if you can name it as it happens to you. I can not believe just which third-country country could use the money lost by these crap. this movie is boring the actors are the boring waste of color A waste air they breathed If you want to see the Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they did in the 60s maybe what the director should do.
