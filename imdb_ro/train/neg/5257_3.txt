For a horror movie made for television, the movie started very exciting. I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the conclusion was a total disappointment. The film went along the fast pace and developed, it seemed like a very climatic end. But guess what does not end. The movie ends and after almost an hour and a half the audience is left to wonder what happened. Why all the questions left unanswered in the film remained unanswered. There was no explanation about any of the key points in the plot. This movie is like watching a mystery of murder and we never find out who did it. Very disappointed. This film shows that the producers have just been out of money and have never finished the film. A real BOMB!
