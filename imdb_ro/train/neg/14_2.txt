There are times when a movie wishes to have a reimbursement for the time spent. It was one of those times. I almost gave up just 15 minutes to endure ... and I would have liked to have had ... The rhythm that a man takes from a controlled life to a fully controlled life irresponsibility could never be so fast. From a graduation feast to the foreseeable end, Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) privilege and culture man allows her to be seduced by a woman through violence and mental alterations. Of course, the woman's side is understandable when we see the talents of beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But for a penny for a drug-drug issue, violence and dedication to a person you just met is incomprehensible. Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do something else ...
