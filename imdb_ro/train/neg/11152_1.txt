Why bother you seeing this movie if you have great movies to see. It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad because I want to see it. Everything in him is stupid. The actors were bad. The script was REALL bad. The story is bad. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club. One interesting thing is that there is a character who wants us to die because it's so stupid to do them a lot. (I do not remember the name, but it was THE BARFIEND OF "The chosen one"). /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 out of 10 stars
