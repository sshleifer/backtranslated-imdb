They say nymphomania leaves you unhappy. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac but certainly has sex with men. She continues to explore, trying to find "more data," so she can see what she wants from life and from the men in her, though it seems she should have a good idea at her age so far . (But I can not agree with someone who says Young is too old for the role, if it is, we should all live that beautiful.) For the most part, this film left me cold, though it is not the most bad of her type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent "Eyes Wide Shut", at least something happens in this case.
