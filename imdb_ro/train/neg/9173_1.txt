I've never seen a movie worse. It is possible to take a shootem video game and turn it into a decent movie. Mistake 1: Absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you do not get involved with any of the characters because ... you have no chance. The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the result of the movie is meaningless, because all the characters have been lifeless from the beginning. Foul 2: the worst weapon scene ever. I like fights. I like when the heroes open the wicked and the clean house. Okay, I really like to see a clean house sometimes. But this struggle was odd, I think the best way to describe it is "Apathetic" I've seen people shot with more sensation and emotion while JOKE THE VIDEO GAME. In this film he felt and felt that the "actors" were simply going through shooting everything that moved without excitement. Why? Where's the garbage? Where are the sounds of rage among gunfire? These should be children who have been caught in a bad slut ... but even real soldiers who act professionally and mercilessly show their humanity. If you want a good horror movie about a retired house full of monsters, I recommend the series of Sam Rami Evil Dead. Do not see the disaster that is the home of the dead. I hope he burns the master and all the copies of this movie.
