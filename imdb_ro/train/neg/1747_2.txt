Start on a nice note just to wander fast and leave expectations. Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's characters (John Abraham) are not properly built before Mac's chief decides to push him with three airs. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. About distribution, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought he was wasted in the role of a moody chef. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very stupid stumbling over furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving saga in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is fun sometimes, but in all a DUD (the songs are boring) and a major left down if you are hoping for some health entertainment and comedy.
