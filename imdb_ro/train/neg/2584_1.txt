So American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie Piece of the series. Although it has nothing to do with the three original American movies, except that some characters should be related to the characters in the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy is in it (can not get the better genre?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to compliment this movie on. There are funny jokes. The act is painful to watch, especially the face with the "southern" accent, which sounds more like a Canadian impersonalization of a British woman who pretends to be a hillbilly using the word "ya'll." This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why not apply to a college where no one goes to class (but everyone gets good grades), girls are constantly taking their clothes in public, everyone has promiscuous unprotected sex, without the burden of children and STIs and can ejaculate all the family photos of a girl without taking care of her? Indeed, this series has fallen to softcore pornography standards. Perhaps for the next, they will break up and hire Ron Jeremy as a leader. I'm sure I can only tie the series, once Stifler's uncle's third, or something like that.
