It was the line of labels "in the American Pie tradition," which tricked me into renting this movie. What I received was a piece of jackass in the style of Jackass, with the major difference that compared to this film Jackass The film seems to be a Citizen Kane. This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 1 in 10, because now I can not go under that. This makes some bad movies look like cinematic facts. Actually we stopped it after 45 minutes and that's very rare. But it was simply boring, stupid, uninteresting and useless. I can not believe that some people reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Throw your head when you were a child? Or was the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and are breasts everything you ever think? Something must be wrong, at least. My advice: keep it clear. Even if you in the mood for a simple film that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you will regret it.
