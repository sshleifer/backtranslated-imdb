Rohmer has been using digital technology to "fill" the background. Sometimes it works well, the place where Grace and her servant confess beyond the execution of the king are particularly striking. At other times, the film offers a strange look of amateur, similar to a home movie. However, the major failure is that the simple artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect on the spectator. Do we know that what we are following is not real, how can we feel about the characters? To be honest, I did not care what happened to the lady or the duke. The other major failure, I regret to say, is the interpretation of Lucy Russell in the lead role. It is practical in every scene, and its success or something else is based on its performance. OK, she speaks a foreign language, but she is incapable of expressing a real emotion. Her emotion in the scene she tells her to her boyfriend, Mme de Meyler (a great performance by debutant Helena Dubiel), seeing her head on a pole, caused an embarrassed laugh in the audience. Also, watch her hands when she expresses excitement! All in all a very disappointing movie, especially considering the positive comments on this site.
