It had to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate comes out and Jed is with a bunch of boys and everyone starts to beat ... so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate waved his hands over the sidewalk, that he seemed to examine the pavement texture. Andie's act is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel love for each other. The other two women were very good and they walked Andie. Anyway, it was a campaign movie. I usually like these types of movies, but I could not get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's act did not help the movie. She also has all the gums. Lancome has to put her makeup with a slicing knife because it looks bright in the trade.
