I'm sorry, but I will destroy both the plot line and the end for you, hoping to avoid a feast of celebration like the one I'm facing now. Father dies, and Mom asks Santa Claus in a letter to bring him back to his family for Christmas ... and Santa Claus. The father is full of peach, happy and well aware of the fact that he died. Everything ends with a sweet heart. But as a parent who has watched me five years ago, losing her best friend canine, it was a horrible blow. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the will of a young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was just a movie and that his dog does NOT come back for Christmas. She was the breaking heart to look at his joy just to know that Christmas Eve would have to face the loss again. Shame on you in the name of all the believers who have lost a loved one recently. It is quite difficult to deal with the loss of a child once, but there are some desires that we should not even portray as a possibility.
