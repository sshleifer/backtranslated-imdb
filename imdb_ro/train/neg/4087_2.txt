Usually, I'm talking a bit about plotting in the first part of my review, but there's not much to talk about in this movie. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better sword and epic witchcraft. Lack of cohesiveness is ongoing, like banality. Even the main villaness that refuses to wear clothes other than a loincloth is pretty boring because she has quite a chest of a young boy. The little funny in the ineptitude is the best and severely retarded at worst. Lucio Fulci was pulled from the bottom of the cylinder here and looks. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extract: Stilale Posters and Galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and the US and International Theater Trailers Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless throughout (some might find it appealing, I did not); Various accessories are topless as well
