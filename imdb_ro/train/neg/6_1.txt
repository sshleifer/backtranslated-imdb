Since the beginning of the film it gives the feeling that the director is trying to present something, what I mean is that instead of the story that dictates the style in which the film should be made, he went in contradiction, had a type of movement he wanted to do and wrote a story to put him on. And he failed very badly in it. I think she was trying to make an elegant movie. In any way I think this movie is a total loss of time and effort. In the director's credit, he knows the media they work with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen worse movies than that. Here at least the director knows how to maintain the continuity of the film. And the actors also gave decent performance.
