I admit, after I became aged hippie, I'm a sucker for such films. I can enjoy a boss of the hippie genre much more than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply terrible in all imaginable ways. Every perceived perception of hippie harassment is presented as a gospel, the cops kill a long young man when a plane landed peacefully. This movie is so horrible that it's not even funny to look like an exercise of excess hippie drones. It's like a left version of Dragnet, except for professional actors. The only reason I gave her two stars was that there were some obscure features on the soundtrack, and I could not find a negative star selection. No actors, almost no plot, sheezy, not even a scenario ... you took it, a "art" movie ... All this is done at the root of the root canal, pulling every senseless scene just to fill time. the bizarre twist of life that mimics art, the movie's "nonactor" star joined a real-life community and robbed a bank in Boston, one of the co-thief was killed and was sent to prison where he was killed in a life- a weightlifting suspect "crash" ... and I think he has to leave that behind as an inheritance ... Oy vey.
