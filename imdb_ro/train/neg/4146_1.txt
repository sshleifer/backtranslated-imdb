After watching this, then I read the summary behind the DVD, then I thought about the real movie ... I became a little dizzy. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed that I was a child of a syndrome down, rolling through an endless forest, where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no other purpose than casual lesbianism without taste. If (zombies?) Come from nowhere and (vampires?) Which (seduce?) Citizens with a clean heart on their way to save the world. Neither zombies nor vampires meet with each other. The only fight I remembered was the removal of Bonny Giroux's pants. Coo Coo as FAT! All! Maybe this happened because I watched him on the wide screen and we were too lazy to change it in his native resolution, but that made it more funny ... In conclusion, my thesis had more a lot of continuity, plotting, character development, antagonism, matter, and then acting the entire film. It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
