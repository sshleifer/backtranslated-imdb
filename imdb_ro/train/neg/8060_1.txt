What a bad, bad movie! I tried to watch without making it quick ... That did not succeed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, I went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing and boring film. I do not think anyone can be beaten hitting a fluorescent bulb much less cooked by one! The only fun thing is that I watched the film's "The Killer Cut" version. The box boldly indicates "More blood!" "More Sex!" "More Terror than the theatrical release!" Oops! If this movie was horrible with all these claims I wonder how blades "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to see a wonderful movie about the world of life and the world of death, watch The Night of the Dead series!
