"Rambo: The First Part of Blood II" by George P. Cosmatos is a pure fulfillment of desire. The United States clearly did not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond imaginable, and this film continues the fairy tale of so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the nation's leaders who made this war happen. Rambo's character is perfect to observe this. He is extremely patriotic, fears that American Americans do not appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the only soldier, but has only a mistrust for senior officers and politicians. Like any film that defends the war (for example, "We were soldiers"), this avoids the need to provide a comprehensible reason for engaging in South Asia. And also the reason for every American American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo takes revenge for the wounds of an entire nation. It would be better to work on how to treat memories rather than suppressing them. "Do we get to win this time?" Yes Yes.
