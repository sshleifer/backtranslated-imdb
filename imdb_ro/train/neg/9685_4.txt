I do not know about you, but I always felt like ART cinema. The first "art" movie I was able to do was Peter Greenaway, "Cook, the thief, his wife and her boyfriend," who blew my mind and creative spirit into strength. The film was the final paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... it was "artistic cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and bringing visceral to the screen for purpose. Life, real life, may be like living in madness, and art expresses it for what it is. I like movies of all kinds, but especially those that amuse and have something to say, whether they agree with her position or not ... 8 1/2 WOMEN "Clinical comedy" , in which a father and son gather a harem to smoke many sexual fantasies. "There is only a very short allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what the previews suggested." The film focuses on the "close" relationship between the father and the son, reunited after the mother's death.In the early scenes of the movie, the sadness of the father is credible, you can feel the pain.What happens next is clear to the Greenaway standards, harem gathering, love and death observations and meat displayed for the sake of the flesh. .. It could argue this, but I feel that the film is superficial and useless. And the idea that it could be a comedy is tangling me, which acts mostly if it is good, Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though poor Mandy should put her clothes back) What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches the excess that made other movies so wonderful to look at. <br /> <br /> While filled with moments of understanding and taboo occasionally, "8 1/2 Women" is too cut and glued to be considered art, too bland to be considered "funny," and pure and just too boring <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
