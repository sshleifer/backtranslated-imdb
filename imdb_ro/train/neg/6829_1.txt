I have written at least half a dozen mistaken reviews about this great little movie and no one has been published, so I have to think someone at imdb.com really likes this awful movie. The idea that a bunch of oil can revive a military tank that has been in the desert for more than a decade, and to make a battle car again is ridiculous. That's the action and the direction. Move it.
