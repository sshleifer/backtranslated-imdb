This Italian film is basically a soap opera with leather. The VHS said it was rated "R", but in the real band inside said it was "X." The latter has much more meaning, because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers who had sex with this guy - and yes, you could see his penis in his mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time a "first-time actress" did something like this on the screen. Detmers parades in nude on several scenes, but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the film is ugly ... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite Detmers' appearance.
