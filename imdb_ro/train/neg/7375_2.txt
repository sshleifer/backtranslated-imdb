This movie was badly affected by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or I would say Steven So-dull! Just before Seagal was too good or too stupid to re-create his own lines, letting someone imitate his voice for the pictures where the sound was to be tilted. A few movies before that he did, but I do not believe in that! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use something, but certain parts of this movie looked like a true movie! Of course, they all say, this movie is pretty bad. It would have been much better without Seagal, who became a cartoon of himself. Not disturb. Anything over a dollar for that is too much! I honestly believe this is the last time for me and a Seagal movie. Why did it take me so long to figure that out ?!
