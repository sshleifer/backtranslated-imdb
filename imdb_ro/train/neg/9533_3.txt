A prologue of text warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our home, but I think the word "entropy" is more appropriate. Good pain, what slobs these two babes are! George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his office in San Francisco and his expensive monstrosity home in Tiburon while his wife and baby are away in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on his door, asking for directions. Well, it rains and shakes like injured kittens and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and with one thing and another, George invites them to come in and take part in it pizza. All three of them end up in George's bath tub and are about five minutes of undifferentiated nudity for the most part in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night a third, and the next morning the girls fix their breakfast. But something became slightly cocked because Georgian guests throw everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup over the linen and - "GREAT like ANIMALS!" George exclaims and tells them to come out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary blonde with blue cobalt eyes and Colleen Camp revolves around her like a gorgeous ball. You have to tell him that you give him a crushing power there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and grow up with strong shelters because we can not figure it out after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when the girls go berserk, so does the movie. The film is then bathed in a green light. The walls put the makeup and made gargoyts in front of them in the mirrors. They create a delivery boy and then drown him to be sure. I'm shooting a storm and destroying windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit alongside each other, licking their food and then skipping the bones of others. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First, Georgia is unconscious with milk (which does not contain anything you can not find in that little red bottle of McIlheny sauce in the kitchen camp), tie it, pour flour and milk over it, subjecting him to a psychotic process, placing him in one of the Tolstoy-type semifinals, punishing him, dressing in brilliant costumes, putting him and his family destroyed by the upper class, and being shipped by a van van ex machina. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it is as if someone had said to Georgie: "Be polite to these girls first, then be panicked after you've been tied up." And for girls: "The first shy act that does not want to impose on anyone, then act crazy." And that's it. <br /> <br /> The shooting and location works are directly from a 1970s porn film. I'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly. The score gives us two leitmotives. Georgie is a pop song with lyrics about "being free" and "giving." Jackson and Donna are a delicious story, called "my good grandfather." <br /> <br /> I appreciate the moral lesson behind the story. There are a few things you simply should not give up, even if it would seem fun first. All very educative.
