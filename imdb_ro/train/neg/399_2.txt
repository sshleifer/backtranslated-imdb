This image began with good intentions, Bacon, the scientist, to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is as cute as usual in her role. Everything falls apart afterwards, it's now your Hollywood thriller, shot on a special effects scene, minus any kind of humor, spirit or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get the audiocassette box with John DeLancie, instead of the invisible man, also with Leonard Nimoy. Now it was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
