OK, so it was written in 1996 before September 11th to give him little confidence in the terrorists' concern and the idea that the CIA director is making a plot to blow up this shattered plan before the world is doomed, it's prescient. That's it. That's the good thing. The actor ... honest. The plot ... foolish. "Twisting" ... useless. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody ever thought about what to do when a plane is contaminated. Do not you think the bureaucrats have a "wound" manual and how to contain them? The correct execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we have seen after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is transported in air, why was the plane door opened and the "drivers" standing there without protection? In fact, has anyone ever shot his feet? I'm a scandal, I always watch a movie to see the end once I started it, but it was a waste of time and, for the most part, predictable. to watch all the ads, was a plus. It's a good example of why I see so little network TV.
