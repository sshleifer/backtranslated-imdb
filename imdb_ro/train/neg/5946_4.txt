There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing. But he has some good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So you go ... like an overall movie is pretty bad, but if you like a movie without a brain that offers only a good action scene, then watch this movie. You do not expect anything but that act. Actually acting too bad a direction. A couple of cameos from Kimbo and Carano ... I looked to see Carano a little more in this movie. a good fighter and a really hot girl .... White is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope that he will be able to land a better movie in the future so that we can truly enjoy his art .. Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... which would be great
