I do not know what would be so great with this movie. And worse, why should anyone see this one? First of all there is no story. It could be said that, even without a story, a movie could be forgotten because it invokes a kind of strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...) but in my opinion this film does not do that never. <br /> <br /> Watch only images of +/- 2 hours. There are several useful things to do. I think you could say the movie is an experiment and it's bold because it's missing everything. But this is worth 2 hours of your precious time and 7 euros of your money? For me the answer is: no.
