Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take a few crazy statements by a terrorist, add a comment by a lot of uber-right reactionaries, assign the most extreme positions of the most fundamental Muslims on the planet to all who are called Muslims and present their theology Islam. Perhaps their next film will involve interviewing Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Baptist Church in Westboro, adding a commentary by military academics and calling their film "What the World Needs to Know About Christianity." Finally, this film suffers both poor production values ​​and lack of attention to the highest standards of journalism. Do not waste your time and money, just start your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few free days and you receive the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
