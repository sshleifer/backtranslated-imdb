What a bad excuse for New Zealnd Movie. I'm ashamed to call myself New Zealander when this film exists and is currently playing on New Zealand's satellite television (Aug 2006). The tower is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-insular ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still on the set, including the ship's funnel. The ship should be a cruise / ferry boat between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and aging everywhere, but it is supposed to be a luxury ship on its spring trip. One of the scenes shows the snow-covered peaks of New Zealand's southern island in the background for God's name! It must have been a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the action is weaker, and the new Zealand / American accents are not working. I expect the taxpayer in New Zealand to contribute to the production cost of this film and that it was a waste of money better spent on real production. I know high school students in New Zealand who could make better movies with mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck in a box with labels on it and they locked a Taco Company sign on the truck door, probably to make it look like he was American. But some signs are over the top of the label - you think he would have noticed that in the props before attaching it. I would like to go further, but it does not deserve the problem in any way.
