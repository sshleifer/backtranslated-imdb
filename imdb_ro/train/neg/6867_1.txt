We can start with the act of wood, but this movie is a disaster. After I grew up in NY, I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or people. I'm not even a defender of culture in any way, and I thought it was a piece of hollywood-type garbage to suit its own presentation and fictitious, ridiculous language that anyone sees Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a waste of colossal time, and even worse, it is not really interesting, because the result is obvious, and the scenes of confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who does this? No one. The name of the writer calls on Israel or something of this nature, but it is clear he has no idea about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his biology, he is shocking he lived in New York and wonders how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films such as "A stranger among us" are better and closer to the truth than this game. Reading this guy's credits, it's no surprise that he wrote scripts on all C-grade movies that have a star shape. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is just below the hair for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
