Recently a part of GEORGE 2 appeared on TV, but I could not look at it all the way. Just terrible! I do not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first film, which was pretty bad. There are a lot of tangles around, but the direction and editing were so wandering and tangled, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having Ape's original voice back, it was not enough to make me warm up. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst hit I've ever seen, and that's what it says. Jeez, because of the 10-line IMDb rule, I have to keep writing when I have nothing else to say about this crapulastic sequel for television. Disney, hang your head in shame.
