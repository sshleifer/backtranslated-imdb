He watched this on DVD in the original English language. Whether the subtitling was very poor, or the dialogue itself does not make much of a story and does not give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this movie, but the movie does not need their presence to make it better or worse. They were. The bright and colorful scenes made in CG are attractive to pure color and brilliance, but can become overwhelming a long time ago. If anything makes me think of a child's movie with the cg's nonstop dam, fight scenes and figure out the plot. I'm sure I understand what happened in the movie, but the whole delivery of the story was pretty bad.
