Nonsense, often ridiculous, that involves the landing of a spaceship and the consequences this causes on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit. I'm always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in the 1983 "Training Terms" as Shirley MacLaine's philosophical son-in-law. As the years passed, Daniels failed to take his hands to a good role, meat. Instead, he is in harmless comedies, like "Dumb and Dumber". As for this image, it fails because of the subject. At least, the television show has brought about a variety of situations. In the film, we have a constant paper, and people turn into monsters, while the government is defeated in the capture of Martian Martin. Mrs. Brown's part is a perfect example of the failed film. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditty guy caught in situations where the Martian left him tangled. In the movie version, a blonde bomb like Brown, tries a romantic entanglement. Ray Walston's television star plays a small role as a government agent or is it really that? <br /> <br /> A great disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much.
