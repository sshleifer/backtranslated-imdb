This is the best way I can describe this film that focuses on a newly married couple who moves into a home haunted by his wife, the first wife who died in mysterious circumstances. Sounds good and good, but what she's playing is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the fun things about this movie is that there is a warning at the beginning of the movie, which promises to anyone dying a free coffin. Well, believe me, no one ever took that offer if someone there is not terrified by plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardens, and the door hit. And music is the worst, it consists of constant music in the tube, which seems to be interpreted by a sixth student. And you realize the terrible secret that is so obvious that you have to ask yourself what the people in this movie think. Someone dies while running and hitting his head, and the police are not called to investigate. Yes, in the end, it's a slow rhythm (which is very bad, since the movie is just over an hour), a little boring story, easy to understand by the average person. Apparently, none of the characters in this movie was the ordinary person.
