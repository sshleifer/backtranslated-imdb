I was very excited about this movie when I first viewed the previews. Normally, I see a preview of this and buy the movie in its entirety. Something told me to ... You know you look at it first. I'm glad we did. Keira Knightley has destroyed all the future films for me with this role. In the second Pirates movie when he left, I went to see him. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think it had to do with her hair and had to cut it short for Domino. Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or do not care. I do not know who was in real life or who was in this movie. I did not care about her character and even Keira becoming stripped in particular did not deserve the movie. The direction was certainly lacking. The writing was tricked a little deep. Editing was horrible. I do not mind style as much as excessive salts. There's a place for that. Good examples of the colorful edited MTV style (not sure if there is an official name) would be the Fight Club; just above my head. Even the Enemy of the State had a semi-similar style of editing to the sides. It was used with taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean, this is the guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me my time back. I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I think the idea that you either love this movie completely or you completely hate it is a fair assessment. Honestly, I hate.
