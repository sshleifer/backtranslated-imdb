During the civil war there were many cases of divided loyalty; Evidently, many have appeared "in border states", where the north met in the south with a geography accident. From the border, young father Owen Moore goes to join the Union Army. Soon, confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, apart from his regime, wanders over the enemy's property, desperate for water; he finds a supply of Unionist Gladys Egan's young daughter. When the Yankee soldiers follow him, Little Gladys helps the Confederate innocent to hide. Later, when she returns to kill her father, she reminds her of the baby's goodness. A Sweet and Little Story from Director D.W. Griffith. Your location video and mankind are shown dearly. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
