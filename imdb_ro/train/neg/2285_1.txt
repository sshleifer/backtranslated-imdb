Well, that's 90 minutes of my life I will not come back. This movie makes teen tv show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The actor was unrealistic. Do not even put the current band at the top of this story, play blades, look, etc. You had to think that I'm one of the hottest bands in the country and there is not enough irony in the world to accept that. The guitarist is considered to be a heroin user, not to blame him, if I were around such a band as possible, with old and wooden songs, I would have injected the horse. music remotely seriously, avoid this at any cost.
