Generally this movie is terrible and should never have been done. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no connection with the audience and the characters, for example, if it's about to be attacked, you want to feel "Oh my God, no!" But you do not in this case, do not you because there is no connection that has been made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed like the movie was great, but there was no such suspense. It could have been a mystery, but it does not exist. "All he has is a set of tools." it was said on the back DVD, you would think that this movie was carefully planned, and made smart, but it is not, the end, was just terrible, very straight forward, and useless too. The action is either medium or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was an hour's loss of my life. "Special Effects" and sets were also mediums, nothing special. There is not much bloody gore or violence, there is not too much blood. This movie has been promoted to make the sound quite amazing, though, indeed, it is not even worth looking for it, I recommend it to no one, unless it is easy to please, a few fights and a story boring.
