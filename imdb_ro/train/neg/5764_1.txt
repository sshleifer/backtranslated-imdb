Scary Movie 3 is such a snowy hard to put into words. She makes movies like Malibu's Most Wanted to show that the Oscar, just lets say that. The original Scary movie was fun, one of the best spoof movies of the '90s, coming from a big team that has previously ruined our world with Do not be a threat to the South Center while drinking juice in Hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the change of distribution and crew would help things, but worse. In 20 minutes I smiled twice. No laughter, jokes were recycled, and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this point in writing, most people on this site voted that 10/10 made me feel physically ill. When there are great movies such as the Rock Out School, which actually have jokes that are * puzzled * funny, anyone wasting their money on clover as this needs their head examined. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
