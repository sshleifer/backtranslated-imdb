A horror story so ordinary about a Brooklyn luxury building that hides gates in hell. It's a reminiscence of Polanski "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but he is too far away from the film by the Polish director in every possible way. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "Sentinel" is not at all. What is most surprising in this film is the distribution: it's full of big names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veterans acting for food (I think). Verdict: It's just funny. <br /> <br /> * My Rata: 4/10
