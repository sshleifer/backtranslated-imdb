Big hair, big tits, bad music and a gigantic safety pin ... ... these are the words that best describe this terrible movie. I like horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but that must have been the worst ever done. The plot is thin and ridiculous paper, acting is an abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is the final disclosure to the cop and the way he discovered who the killer is - it is so terribly written), the clothes are dizzying and funny in equal measures, hair is great, lots of boobs bounce, men wear those cut tee shirts that show their stomach (the patient the men actually wear!) and music is just a synthesizer trash that plays over and over again. in almost every scene there are unpleasant music, tits and paramedics who take the bodies ... and the gym still does not close for death! All joke is a really bad movie, whose only charm is to look back at the disaster that was in the '80s and have a good old laugh at how bad it was then.
