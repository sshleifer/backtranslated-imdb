Whew. What can be said about Gymkata, which has not been yet? This is nothing more than a pure dressing from the beginning to the end. If you want a movie that keeps you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's wild-sweater / sweater in Parmistan (and four billion assorted ninjas), all about this movie is back to hell. Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene into Bruce Lee's Death, he once again depicts his total lack of talent as a director. Some other faces that you probably will not recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, though you will not remember them or care about them after the movie. > It's supposed to be based on a book called "The Terrible Game," which, if I found a single trace of its existence anywhere I'd be interested in reading it, to see where that went wrong. Instead, the apparent book is a fiction of Gymkata's imagination. Perhaps something Clouse did to sell his limp idea. Choose it and Yakmallah for it. It's easy one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's pretty little.
