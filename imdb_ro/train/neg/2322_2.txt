I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie, being the enormous fan of elvis that I am, and I realized it was a great disappointment. kurt russel had most of the "elvis moves" down and the imitation of the voice was great but dubious in singing Elvis voice just didnt work for me. the voice did not always fit with the mouth of the Russians, and it was hard for me to lose myself in the plot because it bothered me to be visible. there were also so many scary gaps in the movie, people who do not know much about Elvis would probably think they were deeds. songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded in real life, the time he received his first guitar is wrong, I'm pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked tomb, not one with a stone of immense foundation, read by JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a television movie, but they jumped over important events such as come-back-special, and they've been shooting some scenes for too long. if you want to see a good movie showing elvis in his main tenet WHAT IS THE WHOLE, or another elvis concert. hearing and seeing the real preform Elvis is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
