I had the pleasure of watching this movie earlier, and I have to say that I thought it would be boring and would ask how it could ever improve the 1984 Bachelor Party version with Tom Hanks, a pretty good one ... I was right ... With all my sincerity I thought it might have been better ... Of course there were some funny moments, but I did not seem to touch me ... The actor was fine and the story pretty good follows the original, but I think it could have been a lot better ... This movie would say it's for teenagers and young people of heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical run of the party film that was done again and again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
