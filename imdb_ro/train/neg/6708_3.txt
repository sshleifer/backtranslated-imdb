Turn your back or you'll have big problems behind MY BOYFRIEND'S! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence full of darkness and ostenience just when you follow it. It's safe to say that the whole movie is breaking up, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to zombie shows that defy the maximum nonsense. We have a name like "Johnny," so often, and this "Johnny" has no place to go. There is no particular reason why our "dead body" should crawl out of his grave just to survive until the ball, so the film is completely useless. Without feeling pain, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor he's dead. Johnny takes a bite from Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer is asked a hard question: Why does the movie have to be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all people who live or are dead is pure coincidence. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show your friend and she will jump over the senior ball, turning your life into a deserted ruin. Blah !!!
