Not? You did not think so! Well, in this case, all you have to do is stay away from "Do You Wanna Know a Secret," because it's just the eleventh worthless, post-"Scream" slasher with absolutely no redeeming value. The terrain is extremely ridiculous; the characters are unbearably stupid, the gore factor is negligible and everything is just boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this movie is inspired mainly by "I still know what you did last summer" because the events take place in a similar setting, and the killer's motivations are just as bad. Why someone would want to steal ideas from junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least the film could depend on Jennifer Love Hewitt's precious shelf, while the girls in this junk are both brainless and terribly unattractive. One year after her boyfriend's unresolved murder, Beth Morgan, her new adulterer and four other sympathetic students go to Florida to spend her spring break in a fabulous beach house. The killer did not make a move throughout the year, but now he is following his post to Florida and is beginning to slaughter it, leaving behind the title as a kind of business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to figure out quickly what is hiding behind the ridiculously ridiculous masks, and the attempts of writers to put you on a wrong track are even embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is simply irrelevant, including the incompetent Florida police force substrates and the FBI's "mysterious" inspector, which seems to have a personal score to solve. The killing is inexplicably happening on the screen (do not you hate it when this happens?) There is not even a free T & A to enjoy and it is better not to get involved in the quality of dialogues. Suffering from such bullshit makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 1980s has gone forever.
