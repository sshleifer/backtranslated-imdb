*** Comments Containing Spoilers *** I was expecting to attend this show as a TV programming when annoying music began in every scene when Don Epps was an average of almost every shot when Diane Farr was very pregnant but I did not notice) and when Colby was a TRIPLE agent. But now in the evening episode, David is trapped in a paranoid, nut-like job, a funny amateur with a gun in a lift and ... CAN NOT REDUCE. A trained, experienced field agent who was the first one through the door several times and is experienced in hand-to-hand combat, CAN NOT BE MY WORKER. Not when the nut work blinks, looks, leaves his head, closes his eyes; not even when looking at the fiber optic thread that sneaks around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. Then came the scene that told me that as much as I like to learn from a weird, charming, but very charming, Charles Epps and her sexy boyfriend / love Amita, my Friday night will be better spent otherwise hired. Don gives David "the word of distress", which is the code for "S ** t is about to go down"; David is ready, they kill the lights, throw the elevator, break the job with the nuts and ...... David can not disarm / kill / fight to convey his work. The bad guy ends up with both GUNS, David finishes SHOT. I finished. I hope the NUMB3RSs are fun.
