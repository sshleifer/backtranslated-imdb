Some movies have crushed expectations and upset me as much as Fire. The film is pretentious garbage. Do not touch anything at an artistic level. The only thing he has managed to receive is a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of the film, rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable. Now, when I suffer from my system, I'm more capable of analyzing the movie: From the beginning, the movie feels unreal especially when protagonists start talking in English. The director, of course, did not make the film for an Indian audience; however, underestimated the international audience by simplifying it. Watching the character of internal help that speaks in perfect English is too unreal to be true. Then we will get a regular insight into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come as jarring and obstruct the flow of film. He still asks me how this philosophical dialogue about the story. I felt surrealism was lost. The scenes of love felt voyeuristic and are probably intended for the public, rather than being a strong statement. In any case, they do not touch either. The name chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Hindu deities and was therefore selected to shock the audience. However, because the movie was not intended for the Indian public, first of all, choosing a name shock is not meant to achieve its purpose, which is absurd. The quality of the direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly treated. A better director could have made a strong emotional drama from the subject. The actor felt from wood, although Nandita Das brought a lifetime role, the others were wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not obvious in this movie. The masters were simply garbage. If you are a fan of the Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from it. Please.
