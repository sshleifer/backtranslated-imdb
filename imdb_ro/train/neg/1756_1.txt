On the back burner for years (as it was reported) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in the history of the sitcom went wrong - and went straight down from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper), meet in New York after a long divorce and recover the life of the other. What a new concept! But, sad about the relationship, nothing worth mentioning (not to mention making a movie about) happened to any of them in the years that followed. So instead of the script, the content contains a single old plot device (another one dealing with older women at work), while the charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner is missing. The support tower is instantly forgetful, humor is non-existent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper have together disappeared. Moore is supposed to block this project for years, waiting for "just the right scenario" before hiring. If this was what she considered "correct," what earth were those she refused? It's not the age of the characters who do this in (in time for the inevitable mark), but the almost total lack of imagination, along with a flagrant ignorance of the elements that made the series work. At one point, this was intended as a pilot, but obviously failed to generate any interest among the potential sponsors. Or, potentially, the potential audience. Forgotten quickly and mercifully, the film is a transvestite and an insult to a classic.
