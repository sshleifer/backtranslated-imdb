The former ballet actor and all the cute boy Rob Lowe play in a movie set in a high-security American prison. I had a feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons, such as Tobias in the first OZ series, but PROXIMITY is not a kind of movie, it's more like a Fugitive movie "The Man on the Run". He also makes a leap on the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn, who puts a cameo as spokesman for a pressure group for justice, but any intelligent discussion about how society should treat criminals is complete ignored because the movie becomes old clich√©s tired of machine shots and pursuits
