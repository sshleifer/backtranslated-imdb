I just saw this movie and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. In principle, he carries the footsteps of the mormon who bears the basketball sanctioned by the church. Rather than looking at this movie, I should have had a root channel. Camouo performances were obviously sponsored / funded. This film had potential due to the scandalous behavior exhibited by Mormons when playing basketball sanctioned by the church, yet because the PG was rated, the true nature of the show could not be transferred to the film. The action is horrible, except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the film was completely useless.
