I'm not sure if Carpenter wants to raise questions about abortion and make the point really hard and obvious that a woman should get an abortion if Satan is the father, but he's moving on. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby is really stupid, basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it. You can see pretty much the material in the Satan costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of story and 55 minutes of tedium. Very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that his baby is dead, the devil destroys the abortion clinic and kills everyone in a giant, bloody and red roar? NOT! He puts his head down and escapes from the room. Terrible.
