I did not enjoy this movie at all. For one, I found them only brutal and vulgar, for no reason. I also felt she was misogynist (against women). Also, the movie does not seem to be anything and I have not found any of the characters feat. In fact, there does not seem to be a point for that. I fell in love with something, but for me, this movie is quite a waste of time when I could have done something more productive and more enjoyable than using my face like a pineapple. James Garner is in this, just like C. Thomas Howell, Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. I'm wasted here and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennilee Harrison (from the later years of Three Company) is also in the film, and it's nice to see him in a role non.but, but other than that, it rises above the mediocre script. For me, the tank is 3/10
