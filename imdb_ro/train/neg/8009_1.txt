In the Lost Son, a private eye looking for a missing man is hampered by a child prostitution ring. This movie incorporates all the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst scenario that exists only in Hollywood's mind, the press, and AG John Asscrap. If you have the chance to see this, you'd better lose yourself.
