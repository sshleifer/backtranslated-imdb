Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, though he is his usual singer and is not a patch for King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse and Friar Laurence, though he never takes it. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic. The sets are nice, if not amazing like some of Shakespeare's other BBC. And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire is 15 years old during production and has no idea how to act Juliet - she is opening her eyes wide and stuttering each line in the same way. Patrick Ryecart does not match her well, and her self-expression is inexplicable. The scene of the balconies flows smoothly and effortlessly, with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their death comes as a relief. If I had a dagger, I'd give it to them early. Anthony Andrews is rude as Mercutio, a big shock if you remember his good work in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse in one thousand two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in a disconnected and unintelligible manner. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. That's great. The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only a blinking gift of putting the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening kick is incoherently incoherent. However, there is humor when in a later fight, Romeo apparently knees Tybalt even in the cobblers. Tybalt then grabs the offensive region. Did he go through this? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long piece. This version is not recommended for use in classrooms or elsewhere.
