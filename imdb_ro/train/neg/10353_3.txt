I have never read the book "A Time Lap". To be perfectly honest, after seeing the movie, do I really want to? Well, I should not review this movie I will start with this. Next, I will say that the TV movie is quite forgetful. Do you know why I'm saying that? Because I forgot what's going on in it. I told you it's forgotten. To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". How do I describe a TV movie? I never wrote a review for a previous one. Well, I'll say they usually have some celebrities. A crunch in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, I'm Not Sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special cheese-like effects, an interesting little plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. Usually these are not good. Like this one. Row in time is a waste of time and a waste of time. To solve your problem, you'll probably forget about going through the second. Well, maybe not the second is over. But in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A ride in time: * / ****
