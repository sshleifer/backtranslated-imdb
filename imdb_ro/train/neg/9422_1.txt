This film describes the experiences of a few hit men (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two dear queens over a few hours a night in Miami. Converged stories eventually bring all people together and at a time. The movie was fun, but the big problem was that everything was happening at night and many scenes were literally underestimated to the point where it was impossible to see what was happening. In some scenarios, you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Someone did not know how to operate a video camera. Amazingly this movie has even been released!
