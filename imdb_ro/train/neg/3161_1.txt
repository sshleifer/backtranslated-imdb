Much of her "Body over her body" is so painful to the unfortunate that I shine in my chair because of the actor's embarrassment. Eva Longoria proves she can not wear a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she does not even have a comedy. She is red and annoying as a ghost who returns to the ground to keep a psychiatrist chef from meeting with her fianc√© widow. The fiance is played by Paul Rudd, spicy and unchaining, while the psyche is interpreted by Lake Bell, bringing the film any anemic energy he has. I was very sorry for Bell because he seems to have some comic skills and worked overtime in the effort to do the physical work. Unfortunately, she faces the insurmountable task of making any movie that accepts Jason Biggs tolerable and she is dragged along with the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of the "Titanic." <br /> <br /> "Over her dead body" actually gave me because of laziness and lack of effort. I started to think about all the exciting projects that can not be funded, because large amounts of money are so shitty. Seriously, does Hollywood think that movies of this kind are pretty good? How bad does the film think it is public? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
