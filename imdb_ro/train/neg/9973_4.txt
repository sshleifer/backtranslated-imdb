"Child Problem" is one of the strangest movies ever made. It's not the worst (though some people will not agree with me about it), but it's not the best. It's a seven-year-old diabolic boy who destroys the comic of a couple without children (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who crazy him. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I do not buy for a second that a child could behave like a rural child like in this movie. It is asinine and absurd, although I laughed several times throughout (I do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm too good for that. If there is a positive thing about "Child Problem" is that it is better than the sequel that was just terrible. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
