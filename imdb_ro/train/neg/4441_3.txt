The "Triumph of Love" is proof that not every Comedian-Fran√ßaise author who uses a court disguised as Shakespeare deserves to be seen. Or maybe something was lost in translating this adaptation of Marivaux, a comedian-inspired playwright of the Commedia Dell Arte, about which Brittannica says: "Its nuanced feeling and intelligent style have become known as marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino has three mixed stories, her pants were not until Cherubino in 'Figaro's Marriage.' is annoying and just seems to indicate that many takeovers were needed for every long speech. <br /> <br /> The best was Fiona Shaw as a spoiled spinster, as well as costumes. <br /> <br /> The audience noises we see and the closing curtain calls to mind that this is all the artifice does not really help. <br /> <br /> (Original Writing 5/29/2002)
