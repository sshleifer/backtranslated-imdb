This movie was a great disappointment for me. I've been waiting for this movie to come for years and I've been a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they've gone bankrupt. Not only have they cut half the story but exchanged information. The statement that Lucifer is the Father of Hope is untrue. He has corrupted his father, but he himself is not her father. Also, the voices did not match the characters, and once you heard the voice of a loved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I do not even remember everything about this movie that was wrong. The bottom line is if you like Lady Death do not watch this movie. It just did not do comic justice at all!
