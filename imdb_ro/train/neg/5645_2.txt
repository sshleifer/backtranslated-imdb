"I thought I'd be locked up in a lined cell and would throw the key." (It's a paraphrase blow to the "Mood" dialogue.) One marvels in what the Paula Milne forest and her co-writer the magic mushrooms that they must have eaten, create this "weak" and bring such garbage to our screens .. A lined cell should really be left to the cusp. Cusack has done the best (like the other actors), but certainly her talent deserves a better vehicle than this. The height of absurdity has been reached, and this "state of mind" is best buried and forgotten and certainly not just "placed in a box and stuck in a drawer ".
