> You are warned that it is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. in a good direction, the images were well thought out. the actors were very good, especially Richard pryor tho I would have liked to have seen more about him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley More God to bless him could have done better. John Ritter would have liked to see him again. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the writer's failure. Perhaps the manufacturer could have pulled the socket after seeing what it created. It is very bad that so much money went into this boiler, when with a little change here and there, in my opinion I fixed it. They must have paid the standard rates of the writers. To make a chuckle.
