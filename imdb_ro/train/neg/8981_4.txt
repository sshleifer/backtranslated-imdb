This version of Paramount / ripoff by OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not so unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments can be there to save what is really a badly shot musical Western film shot on a soundstage and as a live TV show. I can not find the use of the background cycling cycle, lit in different scenes with yellow, pink or red, or ... all that innovative. As I noted, it seems to me more like a movie that was produced on a TV budget: All polls, with minimal sets supported by bright cycles! (Compared to New Facts in 1952), but the actors are doing pretty well, and this style was much better done when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. From the film, this film suggests the often repeated question : they think?
