... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK can be tied to Boogeyman then. Great, really terrible. We had low expectations and failed to meet them! I honestly think of a good thing. so here are the most serious points ... 1. ACTING 2. PLOT 3. CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. PLOT 5. DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. PLOT < br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, they made a 2:32 movie, then they realized they did not put Lex Luthor and Superman together in a scene and they had to set for a 3-minute bit or even thought that nobody would notice that the main character and the negative character have less screen time than the son of Superman and the one who kills him ?! Was it half of the budget spent to convince Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why do not doctors ask "What do you want to do F ***? It's an alien!" We do not know Jack about his anatomy! What happened in the last 5 years, Superman was far from provoking the technology to advance 28 years? If the people who wrote reviews good looking at the same movie? and finally, why? just why? BTW, for those who ask how Superman can raise a whole continent of krypyonitis, I think I realized ... it is affected by kryptonite until it sees something green in the rocks, it is obvious in the head, therefore the work of the continent is only suppressing the fear of the shining brilliant rock .... whether the writers or the writers are half of bad luck, who did not think it was a pretty obvious mistake.
