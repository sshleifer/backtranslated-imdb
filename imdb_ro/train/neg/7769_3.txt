A real scratch of a movie by Bill Rebane, which seemed to worsen in his trade in the eighties. Three million millionaires invite nine people in a distant hotel to compete in a last person contest in which the final competitor will receive a million dollars, provided he does so far. A series of lame boredom is drawn on by some of the guests, while others engage in what most adults would do in these circumstances, namely to be thrown at the hotel bar. Most scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different parts of the female body, including a number of opening dances, which is a review of the American Bandstand, which meets with geriatric aerobics complete with frogs. If there was a hesitation that white people can not dance, this scene knocks the last nail in that coffin. Pay particular attention to the nipple slip. This continues for nearly 45 minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing arrows at various plot overturns, and everything he strikes becomes inspiration for the next scene, making this an incoherent mess. It's a game until it's a game. The three old sticks are in full control until they are. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just a props. They're dead before I'm not. Even the storyteller finally answers that he does not know what the hell happened. I'm defying someone to explain where Rebane is on this. The actor is the morning theater cafeteria minus the dinner. Most actors have probably returned to Stuckey's job. I give a few points for the scene where the yuppie open the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that! This collection of Chilling Classics is really my member. Bane, get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
