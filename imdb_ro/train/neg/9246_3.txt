I refused to see this when it was first released, cherishing the remembrance of the late 1960s, with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not even a remake, and more a parody than a homage, this show did not know how to play it, and it was full of infantile comedy, cartoon characters and characters. The three main characters were just more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a right role). Those who played the role were only known in the comedy of Vic and Bob who wanted to be part of the joke, and too aware of the situation to be convincing. And CGI, although the effects could not have been an improvement over those available 30 years ago, have amazed the viewer with just the lights and working with the camera, and have done little to mask the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and no substance. (And while the show of the 1960s is mocked by the fact that it is a long time, this "update" is now very dated, with "matrix" style modes, the "little girl" scenarios and less than a subtle tension between the two Opportunities.)
