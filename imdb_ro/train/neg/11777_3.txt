Years ago, I saw The Godfather and made me a lasting impression, the atmosphere of the film being first class, the memorable act and the story of a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after seeing Part 1 again, I looked forward to seeing Part 2 ... I was so excited to realize early in the second part, as here was the right piece for the movie of the great God, again everything was almost perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG! I would have liked to stop at II. The story was not good, it seemed like a story made just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protector was a poor person who would have been eaten alive in Nos 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone being invested with all the cults of the Catholic church with the full choir, the assassin riding in the west (if the "good" and all the others are shot), the daughter and the first cousin rolling the pieces of pasta over a board, pulling pathetically on the stairs ..... Corleone stuffed sweets with him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and anguish is it ready for an emergency?) ... It was NOT good and with the best will in the world, I will not be able to look it again. But I will follow 1 and 2 several times over the years.
