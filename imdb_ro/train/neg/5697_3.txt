This is the most elemental kind of traditional ghostly story, not even animated by the use of Irish locations. If James's great gentleman has ever come up with such a slim story - does not James actually have a story called "A Thin Ghost"? - he would not have bothered to publish it. Orson Welles appears in clear pitfalls as a favor for a guild of old friends, the producers of this film. His presence and the film industry once won this Oscar nomination. This is still proof, if necessary, that the Academy Awards have never been a guarantee of merit.
