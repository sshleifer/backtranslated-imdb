The only thing that proves "A Uncomfortable Truth" is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "uncontested" experts are not challenged, because the answer to their invective hypotheses is generally under real science. This is mostly false scientists. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is a person, we expire and if you are not willing to sacrifice your brothers to save the world, nothing has to be done. I have heard how the world will end as a result of man for more than 50 years. Nonsense publishes a time line for their day of extinction and when time passes, nothing happened. "A Uncomfortable Truth" is just another vehicle with which a dissimilar fraction of American society can promote its business. And as far as Al is concerned to leave the tobacco business because of his cancer sister's death, this is also a load. He could not run his farm any better than he could lead the country. He was losing money on the operation because he did not take care of the farm when he could make more talk tours. The only global warming that is uncontested is the hot air produced by this lawn!
