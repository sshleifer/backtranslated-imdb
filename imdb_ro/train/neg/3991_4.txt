I'm not sure why Spike Lee pulled this train out of a movie and fired the poor Stevie Wonder to mend his ever-beautiful music with this theatrical misery. I'm also sorry about how he uses profanity as part of the normal prose of professional blacks. The abuse of his holding on ethnic filming is a shame. Scenes that seem to be invented in blue and that have nothing to do with the theme or the themes, play as if a college child has written this. I especially doubt the absurd scene in which the two rulers are playful players for no reason, and the policemen come and snip Snipes. Excess driving makes someone feel like Spike has no respect for the viewers or has no idea what it is about a movie. The final scene seems to be thrown to justify the use of a sledge hammer to attract a point. This film also supports the myth that all cultured people use the word F in occasional conversations. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same pool as if he did not grow as a film producer. I think his union with Scorcesee in the Clockers was a wise move. They should stay in the documentation as the four colored faces. Shock movies do not make an Oscar.
