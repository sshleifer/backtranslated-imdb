This will be short. Let me first say that I am agnostic and not too crazy about the Xtians, especially Xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone similar to an angry teenager to xtian's mother because he did not let him play video games. I could not take it seriously. Mentioning how Charles Manson believed he was Christ to illustrate the point that Xtianity can generate evil? I do not know he was just cheap and childish - he made the opposition seem ignorant. In addition, the narrator seemed just snobby and pretentious. Delivery has been completely overstretched. I can not take this document seriously. Maybe he has an angry teenager at xtian's mother because he did not let him play video games.
