The horror screenshots of "Poverty Row" from the 1930s and the 1940s try to get rid of me. God knows I have nothing against low-budget films, but those produced at that time have such an unpleasant and wicked look about them - and, ultimately, they are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more fun than the one at the end of the second barrage, such as "The Ghost Invasible" and "The Man of Ape," but it is not classic. Bela Lugosi, long after the glory of "Dracula," still plays a crazy doctor; unbearable, Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in the coffin because, as Lugosi explains to a young reporter (Luana Walters), a doubtful coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. It was a loser. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also at hand, who can thank the fans of the 30's and 40's.
