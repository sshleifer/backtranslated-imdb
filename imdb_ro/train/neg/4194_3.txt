This movie started very promising with the story of a director who is losing sight and a blind woman who has to help him. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed that script writers did not know where to go from there. An unbelievable event followed the following (Russia must be very small because everyone is getting sick each other all the time), the motivation of the intelligible nature of women (why does he follow him after they have descended from the ship?) Why not try to borrow a cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (the story with my mom and boy had to be fun and what was the story with the little sister?). However, with all these arbitrary arbitrary scenarios, the film has been completely predictable. The saddest thing is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the movie was good, the pictures and the score were very beautiful, and the characters of the main characters were also good. So it could have been a very good movie ... but it was not.
