this is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First long TOOO. the longest movie I've ever seen. The stories are too mad over the top! In fact, there are too many stories that the story line is Ruined. comedy was not Comedy !!!!! it was not fun at all .... the story is so repulsive and badly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ........ We had a few expectations from this movie ... ...... but my expectations were completely collapsed in the first few minutes ...... The only good thing about this movie is MUSIC ...... and obviously Vidya Balan. it delivers the best performance and stands out among all the top actors ...... it's just a new brand and yet it shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and Blonde, who play his love interest, also help save this disastrous film. Govinda fits perfectly into the role of the taxi driver. and Blonda also offers a very subtle and consistent performance .... another actress Talented Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay is doing well, but it looks too hot !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... The only one who is not wasted is Salman Because he has no talent to be ever wasted !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's a very impossible movie, with the Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar scenarios, that the story is modeled on silly comedy scenes. imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! 3/10 is four hours long !!!! think about RETHINK before going to the cinemas !!!!! better Avoid it !!!!!
