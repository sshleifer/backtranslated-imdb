This film is the innocent effort of Stephanie Beaton and his new production company. While she suffers from a few problems, as every low budget is doing, it is a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her company. The story is not terribly nine in movies like The Burning and every Friday, 13, on the 2nd. But the performances are sincere. So many big-budget movies have only actors that go through moves, it's always nice to see actors trying to improve their job. The story relates to the killing (and eventual return) of a desert colleague. The others are vowed to keep the secret, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are killed one by one by a terrible stalker, known as "The Bagman." Who will survive? You have to look. If you are Roger Ebert or a number of arrogant critics, you probably should not bother. But if your taste is more towards Joe Bob Briggs, and you want to see a group of people hanging their craft, then check out "The Bagman".
