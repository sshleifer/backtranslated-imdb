This is the first small budget example, winning over what would be a good story. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (after I saw the OC, I know she can do better), then find a better scenario and budget. The special effects were so bad that she almost missed me the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And the transformation of Samaire Armstrong into a werewolf was made by reducing her at first with a bad GCIF figure before she even started to change (Final Fantasy and Pixar people did these ridicule, I think the figure is like a Barbie Nude Doll). The story was interesting, though the idea of ​​a blood line in werewolves is nothing new. As it has been in the balance between evil, (perhaps) not so bad, and the possible end of human nature should be the two lines. The sub-plot of a "werewolf-like" book that performed some of the other characters for a while was effective, but could have been further expanded by explaining what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better script and a direction and I would come back again.
