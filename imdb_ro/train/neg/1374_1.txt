Man, that was hilarious. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. She should have figured out what stank mumble was much easier. Seriously? I want someone associated with this movie to be implemented right away. For all those who are thinking about watching this "movie," let's go over some plot points. Oh, wait. There is none. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and decided to film something with some of his own, miraculously, somehow made a video tape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. Do not you believe me? Go look at her. Do it, man. I dare you. But be prepared to take your eyes off. If you can sit down without blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
