The long list of "big" names in this movie (including the ubiquitous John Mills) did not beat me as far as I could not judge the movie about her real merits. It is full of stereotypes, cartoons and standard scenes, from the humble hero-pins to the loud noise flyer. The musical piece was so that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie ended: crescendo, growing up, growing up and ending the silence, but then the movie continued! I have not found a true story, written in a strange way, but the smart uniforms and beautiful Jean Simmons (a job before the nose) with a wonderful ditty. I can not say that this image has any of the ingredients that make a wonderful movie. I found her maudlin, mawkish and minor.
