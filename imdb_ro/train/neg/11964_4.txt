Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy about parents and sons, about adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that causes him to search for his alien father (Alan King), an extra movie that feels a big star. The script is a nonsense sub-Neil Simon with one line, a flat, inexpressive direction of Henry Winkler (blocked in the sitcom mode) and family conflict at work. Crystal and King are trying all the best, but the king is too eager and often outdated. JoBeth Williams still has one of his invaluable roles, but manages to bring his innate class down to the proverbial character of his girlfriend. It's a comedy, I think, but one that blinks tears ... shameful. ** from ****
