There's still a lot to be done here. The actors are first and the scenario provides a good dialogue that best captures the atmosphere of a close and enjoyable family. However, that's why the movie does not sound true. We see that Leo, who seems to have just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, reacts in essence in a way that is not in agreement with the supportive atmosphere for which he is. Also, the film ends somewhat abruptly, avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have treated in the light of love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is generally impressive and the rest of the film. Unfortunately, scriptwriters could not decide whether they wanted an ineffective dissertation about the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what is devastating HIV on the victim - so just suggestions on both. While this film provides food for thought, it leaves the viewer much more than he offers.
