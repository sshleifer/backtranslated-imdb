It's amazing that this movie turns out to be one of my hit list, after all. It's by far the number one worst movie I've ever seen. Not only have I ever been so bored so far (thankfully no more than 1.5 hours), teenage humor attempts that the feature is not even close to getting, but one of the corners of my mouth slightly inclined. After the very strange first part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. You hope in vain, it only goes down there. The film has no story worth mentioning and repeating this story three times. We can only hope that by the miracle, all the remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris can not get his hands on a room again ...
