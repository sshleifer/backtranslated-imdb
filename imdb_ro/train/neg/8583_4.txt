Americans have an increased attention to a fruit fly, and if something does not happen during a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest very quickly. I found out an interesting fact in this movie: someone has to paint high voltage poles of utility and do it in a program! And guess what, he really would want to do something else (the spectator has similar feelings). Surprisingly, when I was bored looking at infomercials late at night and decided to actually see this movie, I found characters to be interesting and very engaged. I simply do not usually see that much TV late at night, so I can not recommend this movie unless watching dry paint is your idea of ​​an exciting two hours of your life.
