In spite of some daunting moments, a drunken encounter, as well as a river of organs with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanitarium, this silent comedy Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, with the support of Buster Keaton and of St. John is just funny though there's a pretty amusing succession of Arbuckle in love flirting with Buster, which is the latest in "meet cute" scenes especially because it's one of the few times we see the smile of Great Stone Face and laugh in movies ! Also, many scenes seem to have been cut off possibly due to the excessive use of the movie. However, if you are a Kebad Arbuckle or full, Good Night, Nurse! it is certainly worth a look.
