I have to pretend this by saying that I am a huge romantic. From here I really wanted to like this movie. So, I write my thoughts to save others from the disappointment I felt. Years of jump tell the story full of Li-Ann's destiny, which falls for sovereign Jeremy, and undertakes to meet every year damn. A very romantic premise, based on a wonderful story and a cast that does not feel like you look at another Jack Neo Flick. Then why is that so bad? First of all, I feel that directors thought they were filming a video, because they chose to replace the story and any real emotions with briceag mounts, predictable actions and cling lines. I'm both upset and embarrassed to be one of the first few in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in cinematography would agree that our groans smeared from valuable shows spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic film that surpasses Forever Fever, the romantic romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years are not even near. Some blogs have called him "The Crap Years," which is harsh, but ultimately true. Do not waste money or emotions like me. The movie will make you give up love forever.
