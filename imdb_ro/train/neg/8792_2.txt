This film is another example of the curse of the East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories were rolled into one film. And other reviewers have made it obvious because there are more mentions about the "first part" and "second part". How can you have a character evolution or deep plot when characters and story are presented for such a short period? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped suddenly (it was not over, it just stopped in what seemed to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by a second uncomfortable and incredibly incredible part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a flat type (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work with!
