I can not recommend this movie as a date film. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account, living in an estate in Southeast London, is a violent story, Beckettian, about one of the dell's circles, illegally. In his center is Ray Winstone, who made this character before, but never as well. The movie opens with him to order drinks at the pub's bar - that's all - and you are already caught up with a sense of frustration, self-denial, and barbarism that he exposes in many different ways throughout the movie. It is a masters class acting. Of course, those deceived and deposed need a foil in a drama like this and Winstone is shared by Kathy Burke as a long-suffering wife who absorbs and eventually rejects his unbearable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles makes a comeback just like Billy, the firefighter, though he should sometimes wonder exactly what left behind. Gary Oldman directs almost the actors, maximizing the claustrophobia of their council. 4/10
