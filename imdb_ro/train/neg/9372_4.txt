This is a typical late Universal Horror movie: Comprehensive from a technical point of view, whether through numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some seriously overacting. The most interesting part of this film is casting Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the "monster" of the film. It's sad to see this exploited man, but he probably used the money he paid for it. Hatton is less horrible than the studio hoped, because I often felt sorry for fear or even contempt. Martin Koslack is aboard as the crazy artist of the movie and is very funny in this part. I'm glad to see Koslak in almost everything; for some reason, the man amuses me. The only other part of the movie that amuses me is the absurd film making in the art world. Here are the bad art critics who enjoy their ability to break artists; this is one with the male "hero" of a movie that is the "artist" who is painting ... you get this ... girls. Somehow, the work of our hero is reviewed alongside the absurd sculpture of Villan. Also funny is the main critic of the film, who at one point claims to despise the hero's art because "such women do not exist" to which our hero answers with assurance that the critic does not get enough. Finally, there is a bit of subplot about the heroine (which is a critic of art) domestication by the leading man ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to be witnesses. Generally, this film is a fairly mediocre picture with some funny elements.
