Hi, it may be because I'm not a major theater or a sophisticated movie ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". I hired this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's the title ... but guys what a waste of time ... just watch two boys sitting in a vault and talking ... The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... I watched the darn movie ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on a DVD, then they should make some digital reminders. I was also totally surprised to see these highlights on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before, I'm not as sophisticated as the other people who commented earlier on this movie.
