On the day of birth, little boys tell my mother that she is not her son and that she wants to go home to her real mother. In some respects, Comedy De L'Innocence feels he comes from another shooting time, probably in the 60's or 70's. Of course, he reminded me of the secret ceremony of Losey (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977) ), both dealing with the loss, pain and relationships between parents and lost children> <br /> All three films are populated with non-symptomatic characters who behave in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films have a cool feeling both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-to-child relationships, and finally, all three films raise the question - "what is real, what is imagined?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful, but erroneous, does not provide easy answers and leaves too much hanging, inexplicable and strange.
