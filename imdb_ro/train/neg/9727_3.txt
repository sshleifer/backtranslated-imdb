Another of my wonders in the shopping cart, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a terrible horror load, complemented by the striking lady. Everything started so well - I liked the little intro with a "newsreel" about the young couple exposed to a nuclear explosion and was totally absorbed even until the first person caught fire ... Since then the film has descended to a mood and sometimes it has become almost embarrassing to look. When the heroine was shown to have been affected by the same condition as the main character (the ability to shine its own shots without a match), it seemed as if someone had thrown the idea at the last minute ("you'll be good!" , you can hear them by telling them ...) As for the almost psychic connection between the main character and the nuclear power station, well ... The film came as cheap as you pay if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for that you're done.
