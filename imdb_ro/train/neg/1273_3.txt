I have two good things to say about this movie: the landscape is beautiful and Peter Falk offers good performance (given what had to do in terms of dialogue and direction). However, I said that I found this movie extremely tiring. Watching dry paint would have been more fun. It sounded much more than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence, where everyone talks to each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything he told her on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is full of cliches and dice, not to mention the endless incidents of flatulence heard by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to try to laugh or tears. There are a few sequences that touch, but all are played for laugh. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and "cute" call to you, you will love it. But if you're hoping for something with more substance, you see another movie.
