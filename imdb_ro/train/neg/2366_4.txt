I'm a Nightmare fan, but it's horrible. Deaths are so modest. If you follow this, after 20 years, the whole nintendo scene is overcome. I liked flashbacks. I think he should have made a prequel about when he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. It depends on how long you have.
