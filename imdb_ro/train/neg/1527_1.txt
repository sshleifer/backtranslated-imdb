If you really want to really lose two hours of your life, do the following: 1) Look through the TV list. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When "Men in White" comes, sit and watch. And that's it. After spending two hours of bad, awful movies (and not funny) and experimenting with something with the smallest production values ​​ever made in recent history, you will lose two hours of your life and wonder why. Why did I do that? I was pretty stupid to think the movie might actually be good. It was not. But, on the other hand, if you're big enough to remember the Power Rangers, you could show some familiar faces during the movie. Probably to save production costs, Saban (also the Power Rangers) decided to freely sprinkle old monster suits all over the world, favored by the toys of the nourishing toys of all the players in the movie. I've seen some old monsters in the episodes I've been seeing since I was a kid, so I suspect that at least it has a nostalgic value. But if you want to see the real power Rangers monsters, go to the Power Rangers watch yourself. It's much better than this piece of garbage. (And that says something!)
