I finally saw INCUBUS after waiting twenty years strange years to see it well, certainly did not deserve to wait all this time to see it. INCUBUS is a horror movie strictly called: the killer / unseen fast monster and kills women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film goes like this: the movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; Another killing (surprising, right?); blah blah blah, etc ... The movie is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the "big" stupor of red herring used throughout the film would not convince a 5-year-old. And I realized the secret identity of the incubus when I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise arrived, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that we kept scary days after we saw the movie. It's so silly! However, the movie is so numberless that the sequence of "rock band" is one of the few great moments in this disturbing movie. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so fun and useless: the big-screen movie shows a video-rock moment with a guy in red leather shoes getting his obvious fake hair long cut, all this was edited with scenes of a girl who is attacked in the incubator cinema. The best thing I can say about this movie is the cinema, which I liked. But besides, almost nothing worth mentioning about INCUBUS, except that it is unintentionally hilarious.
