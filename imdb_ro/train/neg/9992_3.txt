Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable film. Was I especially taken by the scenes immediately after the accident, where, while the survivors were desperate for matches, at least half a dozen burned fires? without any apparent reason? at various points of wreckage. Fire seemed to be a predominant theme all the time. They searched for bodies for briquettes and matches and finally finding a box built a fire every day for, apparently, 12 but no one ever gathered wood. When the vegan burnt the bodies, what did he use for an accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen? maybe not. Despite the apparently low temperature, everything you eaten, blood. Maybe it's just me, but even in an incredibly incredible story (none of the survivors ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman until the end), if you are dealing with small things, bigger transactions become more acceptable. What did the prologue (1972) do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold his hand, froze and did not fire. Give me a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminent Canadian miracle. And, with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as coach. Well, I could add, the rabbit that they ate (in spite of the fact that it looks like the chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorpha. Now if it were a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the writers missed a real chance to have someone note "It tastes the same as ..."
