The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest because the film was partly filmed there. Unfortunately, between the two main characters there was a zero chemistry, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The scenes of love were forced and mechanical. Winter Kirckland was really rigid, almost ice-covered. Rob Stewart was pretty charming and boyish, so he looked more like a sister bigger than his girlfriend. The end, when we finally figure out who was actually after them, was pretty weak and it made no sense. I think I would have liked this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors was a little more credible.
