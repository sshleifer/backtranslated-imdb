Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. At first, looks great, but ultimately does not offer any satisfaction - none. Land is a misery about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how is it possible with this basic plot AND Robin Williams to make the movie so bad? It's because the image is depicted without any substance - just like the terrible image of Popeye that Williams did at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but maybe not enough money to hire writers who have graduated from a school. The film is an unfortunate joke that continues and continues further. I'm really not sure why it was done first - it certainly was not meant to offer any kind of entertainment.
