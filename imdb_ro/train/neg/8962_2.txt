I think he was sucked in by the ice because he left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to your imagination. However, this foolish fest gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the act is solid, I think the reason it was a downer was because it was made by other people than those who filmed ORIGINAL if Vincenzo Natali had this prequel or even a sequel I think would have done better and would have been more true to the source. so I recommend you stay away from it and HYPERCUBE, another movie that I do not even want to talk about ... (I gave her a 2 just to act)
