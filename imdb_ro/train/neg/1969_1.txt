I just saw this movie and I have to say that although an effort was made at first to produce a decent film, it was absolutely horrible - but not in the sense that I intended to be sure. > It was like a child who directed this insult to intelligence, with the conviction that all the viewers who should have been old or extremely difficult for their entertainment or both .... Thank God for coming forward! I can not imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when he made this film. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, albeit hardly, and a script that screams for a total rewriting ... I can not say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror movies, that would be a good effort. If you find that this movie is fun, then we strongly advise you to seek guidance on the purpose of the films. There's a lot better out there. Join a club, READ MAGAZINES, but, above all, avoid such crap.
