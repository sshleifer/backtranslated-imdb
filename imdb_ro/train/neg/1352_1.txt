Eytan Fox, while generally relying on the apologetic side of Israeli politics, made several quite interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and simply the wonderful film "Yossi & Jagger". In "Bubble", however, he took this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme. Far from giving this film a standing ovation, the screeners I participated in quietly stood up and left. I also walked quietly, smoking with anger in such a ridiculous, unilateral film that translates self-preservation as racist aggression and racist aggression (and terrorism) as an outburst of justified rage; which implies that the Arabs are so injured by the evil Israelites that they react in anger to a steady flow of unilateral Israeli aggression against them and that they should therefore not be responsible for their actions. /> This movie is not worth the money I paid for the ticket (indeed, I thought I was asking for my money back) and it was essentially an Israeli call to the Palestinian film "Paradise Now". If you want to be anti-Israeli, then, by all means, watch this movie because it really justifies such a system of faith. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, worse, by a talented Israeli director, is a cry of shame. Indeed, how Israel may be surprised to be regarded as a pariah state when the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israeli propaganda, believing beggars. What a small and shameful movie!
