This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it is absolutely awful God, John Carradine has a very low screening time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists and turns that ended in pity. The awesome setting and creeping house would definitely have helped if it were not so boring and there is no character to be rooted for any of them, and I hope it's a 100-degree path because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally appears, it's a fairly good scene, but it's too late and the only screen time he's got was in flashbacks, plus the only really serious scene in the movie is when a character is making his face disturbed by Bee, because it was pretty bad. I got this in a set horror DVD called Back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky it was included in a set I bought otherwise I would be chucked this out the window! This is one of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen, because it is God God Almighty, John Carradine has a very limited screen time, and I say he avoids like a plague, you do not want to go through torture . The direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson makes it absolutely terrible! work here, making every thing look cheap, squandering the potential to make a creepy atmosphere and keeping the film at an incredibly boring pace. The action is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene but other than he's hard in the movie, other than flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!). Merry Anders is good here as Laura, because he does not convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is all right and somewhat horrible, but also overcome, had a creepy smile at the end. The rest of the casting, we did not pay enough attention because we had a lot of trouble going through it, but they were really bad. In general, please avoid this, do not deserve agony! BOMB out of 5
