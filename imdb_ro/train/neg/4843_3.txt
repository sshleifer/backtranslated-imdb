Well, I've also heard all the comments and no-notices about the way this film deserves the best Oscar, so I went to see it today. What a major disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from the members of the US Army who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this film are. They reflected my own thoughts; While the movie was playing - a complete civilian - I was thinking of myself "say what? there is no way to do that ..." 2) There are very few things that actually happen with regard to the plot . A new type of bomb disposal is presented to replace one that was killed (a death that is not clearly explained clearly). The new guy receives a lot of adrenaline from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S IT! 3) This movie is never close to the suspension as claimed. If you want suspense, try one of Bourne's movies. If you want to see an emotionally powerful war movie, try to rent Go Tell The Spartans about the Vietnam War, and see Burt Lancaster (who told me PERSONAL in a supermarket meeting that was a movie that one he had seen as one of his best works and which he was still upset was largely ignored by the exaggerated Apocalypse) or an old black and white classic, Sink The Bismark , which, English Film, is incredibly unimaginable. Do not waste time with Hurt Locker.
