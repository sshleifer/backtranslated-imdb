I watched the mask in the 80's and is currently present on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking she was cool that day and that she had a few toys, but looking at me now, it bothers me with tears. I never realized how boring and not at all this cartoon show really was. It's just terrible! It's not where it's in the same league as the Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and it's been forgotten almost everywhere after it has ceased to be done. I just look at Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 comes right after her (that's if the mask does not let me sleep first). One of the animated cartoons of the '80s, which I hope to completely forget again once it has finished broadcasting Fox Kids!
