Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of MST3K's seasons, but this rare movie before the first season (K-20 episode) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three majors, Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, are fighting the worst batch of cinema ever, delivering lines that must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style group of Exxon and GM lawyers is trying to reduce funding for transit and energy efficiency research. Apparently, he was filmed in almost dark, possibly Super 8. He makes Logan's Run look like Shakespeare's sinister cinematic chapel. I can not imagine seeing him without the comment of Crow and Servo, because he is indescribable even with him. Obviously, what is needed in Hollywood is a kind of 401K, which prevents actors from making bad movies like this to pay for medical services. With the theme of "The Right to Pollution and Leadership", I finally look forward to seeing a Charlton Heston, where he gives his "cold dead hands" speech. Lee, could I forgive you for that in 1989, but 1981?
