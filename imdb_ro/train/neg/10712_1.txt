This is undoubtedly one of the most serious EVER films, I emphasize, EVER has done. What's worse, my old Dolph hero is in it and he plays it. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way it was done even made my body hurt. Battle scenes for beginners are both co-organized as a fight between two drunkards who push her into the trough. The actors, except Dolph who also sucks, behave so badly that you can not wonder if their reason to be there is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way must have been the most often absent, if not all the time. This is $ 12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because in terms of effects and landscape, the cost can not be a price above ยง 1000.
