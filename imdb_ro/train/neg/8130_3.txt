While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... The occasional creepy atmosphere and some decent makeup effects (though under use) do not save this A horror shot of be a sub-paradise of the creature of man becomes. The batsmen, who live at night, suffer from a senseless story that is strangely and rhythmically drawn. The plot does not seem to go anywhere, and the film never provides an explanation for what is happening or even a satisfactory conclusion for all of this. The distribution is fairly mediocre in terms of their performance. I still give the film some points for her theme song and beautiful shooting locations. Stan Winston's makeup work is pretty good, but he does not have a presentation here. A missed opportunity for safety. <br /> <br /> Definitely, one of the smallest creatures of man is there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
