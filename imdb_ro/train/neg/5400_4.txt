This is just a soul-filled gore, based on Stephen King's story. Two tabloid reporters, one spicy (Miguel Ferrer) and one unfulfilled (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. It is stranger than odd that the blood-sucker of today does not naturally sit, but, through a black Cessna, looks for its victims. The gore becomes, in fact, terrible as the movie approaches its stupid end. Note that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit it's a bit frightening in the early hours of the night.
