This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It is not scary or any of the other things suggested in the sketch of the plan. This movie is agonizingly slow and I was bored for almost all 98 minutes. While acting is the best mediocre, the biggest problem is the scenario, which is badly written, slow and frustrating without a real direction. Occasionally, an offensive disposition is set only to be infringed by a particular line or unnecessary event. I'm not surprised that the whole distribution was sick and throwing themselves in between the photos, eventually trying to digest a terrible scenario. As a big fan of horror films, I'm always irritated that something bad is being done. Save for 98 minutes that you will never come back again.
