Yes, people are racial. People are even racist in college. This is a good point, and the issue of racism has been treated several times in countless films. What sets Higher Education outside the package is that it deals with the problem of racism in the broadest and most predictable way possible, yes, it is also in college. This film treats this issue of racism in the way Frankenstein deals with most of the problems, swallows you over and over repeatedly in a brutal and slow way. Most characters are caricatures, unique cartoons (lesbian feminists, angry black man) that react to situations as dramatic and predictable as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes, this film is overlapped with them. Angry black men feel deceived, females hate men, etc. (a feminist even has a sign that says "Dead Men Do not Rape." Do you see what I mean?) I do not want to give anything, but in this movie if someone seems like a lonely bloody or a rapist of data probably it will behave exactly as you expect. The changes the characters make are obvious to everyone, but to the people in the movie. The big twist of the plot depends on whether violent neo-Nazis will act as violent neo-Nazis. I think you'll have to watch to find out what's going on. Another problem I have with this movie is that it should be "tough" and "hard to hit", but they make the bad guys the Nazis. I agree that the Nazis are bad, but that's my point. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we do not break any new land here. The Nazis have been described as villains as early as the 1930s. The film does not deny any point of view or make bold statements. It only deals with the issues we all know in a ruined way, after school, special. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not exactly a firm stance on a controversial issue. Higher learning is predictable, perfect and in a bad way. Avoid at all costs.
