Undoubtedly, an unintentional hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it's not as good as any of these garbage ministers. It's about the sheriff acting, Artie (Taye Diggs) being called to investigate an almost fatal drug overdose at a higher university but to keep her down. As he digs deeper, he thinks it's much more than he seems at first glance. We're watching Alicia, the girl who survived flashbacks. About 90 minutes, if this movie was well received from the beginning, it would have been worn out. This film brings nothing new to the table. But it's the only movie so far that has Miss Swain topless so the degree is bigger just for that. My Grade: D Candy Eye: Dominique Swain gets topless (setting a mistake of "Fermi Campers"); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more men than the girl's ass
