And how many actors can come to stand for his own person neurotic, compulsive uber-New Yorker? In this film, Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is far less direct kind of adornment than they did Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity". It's an annoying repetitive story now: nebulosul, neurotic man with a wife or a girlfriend falls madly queen's Shiksa he designs all kinds of perfection. Everyone lives in the perfect gigantic apartments in manhattan neighborhoods, everyone always keeps expensive and exclusive restaurants, during which all the characters relate to fascinating anecdotes and discuss the arcane philosophy, there is always a trip to Hamptons during which the main character nebbishy effort physical and possible exposure to diseases and then, of course, the main character feels guilty for his craving for queen Shiksa, but seeks anyway, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, etc. This formula tired, and proof that Allen is not a great film artist. He looks just like an old dirty sexual arousal and emotions of an elderly aged 20 years who intend to always tell the same old stories and boring.
