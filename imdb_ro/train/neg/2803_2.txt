Considering the boundaries of this film (The whole film in a frame - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total) should have been much better done. If you have these limits in making a movie, how could illumination be so bad? And the actors were terrible, speaking a hair below the actors from the clerks, except that it was a pleasant film, it had no substance. Well, he tried, but really failed. An attempt is made to self-correlate in a few parts, but the lines were so badly rendered to actors that it was bad. And the main character, Neal, who is pathetic weaker. Obviously, 10 people did this "movie" and they met each other and it was probably a real rock band they had, but no doubt these people have no idea how terrible they are all. This was done in 2005, but it all looks so good, as if it were the pre-grunge era. Luckily I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand offers again!) But it was under the title "Possessed" not Studio 666, no matter what you do for the title, it can not help. This could have been a much better-made movie - there is no excuse for this bad movie when you have the obvious limitations the filmmakers have had when doing that, working within the limits, you have to do things which you can control and things can work with everything you can. Instead, they thought that mediocrity would be good enough. And this musical video, wow that was bad, we quickly fowarded through it. So, 2/10 is correct, if you're in the whole b-movie carp I guess you'll go and see this.
