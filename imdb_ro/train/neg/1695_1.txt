OK when I saw the previews for this movie, I thought it looked very scary and was very excited to see the group I was with. Now living in America especially during these elections, I see some very deceptive things, but I have to say that these previews were at the top of the list. I do not see how there could be so many people scared of this movie. I only noticed two real scenes and just jumped to one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and may have disturbed me for some jump scenes for me. As for the sound effects, so many who were so frightened that I thought they were at best comic. Oh and catboy where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the movie had to be the odd bad luck. How's that scaring someone? I can make the noise easily. Now do not get me wrong I always loved all the scary scary movies you just laughed along the whole road, but I did not even think that this was done because it was simply bad.
