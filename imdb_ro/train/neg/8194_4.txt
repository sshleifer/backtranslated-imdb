How hard is writing a movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently very difficult for the writers here. I still have no idea how Santa Claus is younger and looks 20 years longer than Vince (who plays the big brother). Probably we lost that part of the story, but it does not really matter. Many scenarios seemed to be lacking in place and countered; the kind of "funny notions" that are drugs out too far to the place where a sense of comedy is lost. The director / producer tried to go to the end of the "jerker tear", which would have been appropriate if NICE leadership up to this point was worth pursuing. Uh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, because many people will take any garbage they are fed, but I would strongly encourage the waiting for the DVD on it. It's NOT worth the $ 23,978 you have to bring your family into movies these days.
