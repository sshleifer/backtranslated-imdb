With a movie called "Gayniggers in the Cosmic Space" how could you go wrong? Just throw some of the top stereotypes of the characters, use Village Villages as the main providers for the soundtrack and throw in tons of homosexuals. The plot is unimportant. Too bad that the movie does not contain any of these things and that every joke is losing the place. Characters look different than the German gaynigger, they work one or two jokes, the rest fails. The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more about the movie. My expectations were apparently high.
