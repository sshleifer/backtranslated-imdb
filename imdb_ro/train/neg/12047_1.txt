I had the greatest enthusiasm to participate in the screening for this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind and was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (just before Tolkien). I have to say it was an enormous scorn. They completely plotted in a joke and turned it into one long opera. The elements that had been faithful in the plot were sprinkled in all sorts, so the audience often laughed at the stupid scenario that had just paid the pocket of this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of powers almost similar to the Matrix, totally ruthless and male lovers in the original poem) to return to "Fabio on the beach" under his mask Pitt with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original figure of the warrior Hollywood ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to do the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of such great talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and you do not even have a candle. A lot of pieces for the ladies to occupy over, but not enough fighting scenes for a movie about a long battle and a siege. I would not recommend someone to pay to see this story fired through the dirt as one of the characters was (at least they have the right part of it).
