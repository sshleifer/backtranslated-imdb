Words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I saw the movie last night and I could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who was held captivated by Rednecks in the Deliverance style. Act, writing, direction, photography and movie editing are deplorable along with a song called "Soldier" that must be one of the worst thematic tracks of all time! However, there is a treaty. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in the movie that plays a bad guy of laughter. Otherwise, avoid this disaster at ALL COSTS.
