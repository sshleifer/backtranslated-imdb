This is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. It's very confusing and useless for long so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> I and my GF imagined this movie (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * First of all, this movie is actually quite simple after remove all unconscious junk-vis-state junk (95% of the movie). Ignoring the junk, what really happened is this: A group of school friends go on a rave night. They're leaving and getting into a car accident where everyone, but Cassie and Sean die. This is the simple version. (That's right, I told Sean, talk to me) Immediately after the accident, Cassie was in the hospital, locked between life and death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream part starts. The movie is called Survivors, is not it? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident interacts with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the two strangers, and Jude) along with images suggested by her mind (Sean, school and everything around her). The souls continue to do what they defined as: Annie chickens, the two strangle-killers (from the opening scene), Father Jude continued to help people, etc. <br /> <br /> We are then taken in (many of which I and my GF can not yet bind) but everything is reduced to it is not Cassie's time to die. At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She's fine. Then the director adds a little more spice, trying to confuse us again, showing a small fragment of her dream in the wheelchair, being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare and wakes up alongside Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. Because of the space restrictions, we did not cover anything, but feel free to send us an email. <br /> <br />
