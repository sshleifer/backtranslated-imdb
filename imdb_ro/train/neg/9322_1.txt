Please do not be fooled. And if you're looking for a cheap horror film to laugh: it's not like that. Usually, I'm going to be stupid if it's funny, but this stupid guy was so stupid that almost (or maybe) he was stupid. The quality of the movie is better than a portable hand, but not long, and it's very likely that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These issues should not really be a detector to see a horror film, but add this amazing (crying) cast, and you have a real humdinger. The story is about a guy who invites his friends to the family cabin in Texas for the weekend. It also extends the invitation to crush her lady in her office. On the way they meet a woman in distress who is invited to come along the other girls. Stay in the cabin includes sex and nudity, and soon, everybody's panties are in a bunch when a girl disappears and weird things are back in the house. From there, you (the audience) and the morons, the actors, try to figure out what's going on and soon you start trusting each other. Generally, I think I made her sound better than it is. The main fight with this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the controversial plot, acting badly and the flawless motivations. Once again this could be forgiving, it was a bit funny, but unfortunately it is not. The end of the twist is just a twist in the fact that nobody would guess that just because if you really thought back the movie would not make sense anyway. Please do not let this review stop you from seeing the cut-off miracle in this movie. (Woah, my nose rose eight centimeters.)
