After I was forced by my children to see this at least 10 times for each of the last two christmas, I feel properly qualified to vote this version of Dr. Seuss's classic story and well ... it's not very good. First, following a classic act, such as Chuck Jones's specially animated television, will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so difficult to handle and lined to be positively excited. I will admit that there are a lot of inspired gaggle, but in general, the movie breaks out like a calculated cash game, at the same time as it is supposed to dishonor Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually over the top, but that's totally in contradiction with Grinch's character. As characterized by Boris Karloff, he was burned slowly; methodical and cunning. There is no way for Carrey's madness, and this is the most obvious mistake made. Talented actors such as Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I want to say that I understand that Tony Hopkins will take almost any role (like Michael Caine's countryman), but it has to be deposited under "Movies that should not have been done." This is not a good thing for Cat Hat, a slimier event that Universal prepares for this Christmas. I have the feeling that I will make the same recommendations for those like myself: skip it and read the book or watch the TV special. This is 2 hours you can never, ever come back.
