If you want to know what kind of music others have heard in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you also have to listen to many whistles and violins (see my comments on My Face 1 for reference). Indulgent Admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance after seeing her predecessor. But as an adoptive woman who is preparing to finally settle for my mother's birth, My Girl 2 made me look at the subject of my mother's search. In other words, everything I liked about My Girl 2 nothing to do with My Girl 2, but about a protagonist who asks, as many adopters, "who is my mother"? And if there are my mother's home movies in an acting band, I'll be sure I'll make my own movie about it. People are pressed. Movies should not be praised. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... unafraid. Avoid if you are not a complete hand that is comforted by a series of small annoyances.
