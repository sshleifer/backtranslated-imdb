We had great hopes for this movie. I thought the premise was interesting. I stayed through him, even if I found my acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, unimaginable. I keep hoping that the time spent would have paid me, but eventually I let myself wonder why they even worried about doing so. Perhaps in the version of George Orwell there is a message that deserves to be transmitted. If this movie did something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe that his story could be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the film maker's message is "worldly life worth living" then they have succeeded. I would recommend this film to anyone; 101 minutes of my life were wasted.
