Actually, I retired from the Asian horror movies some time ago, after I got sick completely to see the garbage stuff about the ghost story. However, recently, I was increasingly in exploitation and decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was very well-known director Takashi Miike, "Visitor Q". I had already seen Audition, and although I did not like it too much, I think it's one of the best modern Asian horror films. So, we came into this situation with sensitive expectations; and unfortunately only found boredom. I suppose this movie is really smart and it just broke my head, but what seemed to me was simply a collection of violent and ugly scenes with a little or no coherence. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous about me; all that Miike did here is to make a movie; any intelligence that surrounds her has been implemented by demanding fans desperately to find some sense. My headache was set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason) and did not drop until the movie ended. at least twenty-four hours later, or so it would seem. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against film violence, and actually I've been actively looking for the most notorious movies around me; but while this can be violent, it is also useless and boring and I have not received an ounce of joy from it. Takashi Miike could have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope it is the last time I get in touch with one of his films.
