Have you ever seen a movie that lost the plot? Well, this did not even have a start. Where should I begin? The painful scenes of our heroine, which stood around the house without any sense of threat or even stuttering, even during the seemingly permanent storms (strangely never heard in the house - thick double glazing)? The house that seems to be just a few kilometers from a city is within walking distance (?) Or the third girl who has no purpose in the plot but to offer a surprisingly quick, surprising crime, just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or is it the beginning that suggests a siret of 20 murders all over the area, even if it is obvious that the killer never ventures away from home? Or bizarre ritual with salt & pepper that almost sums up most of the inherent lack of direction film. Add a lead actress who can not act, but at least he is willing to make some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this movie is really ugly but not the way he hopes. Given a prosecution simply because it was forbidden in the UK in the 1980s (especially because of a surprising ending over extended crime), it offers nothing but a curiosity - and a classical crime of "daft" do not worry - telegrap at least ten minutes before). After a walk in the forest, the victim comes in a rather steep, upward slope, which obviously fights. Half way down, they see a top figure, dressed in black, with a big scarf. What are you doing? Swipe down and run like us? No, of course, they do not ... fight to the top and stand conveniently and vertically in front of the murder weapon. It's really just a movie as it says ..
