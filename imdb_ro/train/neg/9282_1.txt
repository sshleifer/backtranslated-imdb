This film is not worthy of the Omen title. It is so bad that it actually affected the classical nature of the top three. It should not have been done, they should change the title. They do not even get the name of Damien Thorn right !!!! And there are no punches, the most important element of all Omen movies. Pull it out of the shelves and burn it.
