The word in the abstract sums up d'oh;) Five girls are lost, trying to find their way home, when they stop at a store to get directions when they hit a car park that breaks a beacon on it, problems, but suddenly they see that a beacon appears behind them (ooooh). From there everything screams, weeps and rages when it tries to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a lighthouse;) well, scream and cry are pretty much in the whole movie (very annoying) The film is shot, with a cheap room trying to make it look "real" or "shocking" I think it's embarrassing and useless, though. In the absence of another better thing to compare it with the "Blair Wizards" style. The screaming and weeping for almost the whole movie with strange sounds was over the top annoying, you got a headache :) I'm sorry, but this was not scary, just an annoying painful piece of carp film.
