This is why many people are homeless. . . because stupid producers are paying their money to make horrifying movies like that, instead of donating if they can bother! This movie is even worse than white puppies! Little Man has a blade excuse to put a baby like a baby. The story is terrible given that it was written by six people. However, the idea would not be too bad if it were original and it would not have been a cartoon episode. has funny moments, but some of them are outdated and some are stupid. The act was very, very bad. That was the direction. Anyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. is racist and very offensive to cats. I mean, instead of showing sympathy for them, the filmmakers are having fun with them! It really disgusts me how I do it. They see that cats are like kids. And for a character who is a doll, pretending to be an abandoned child just to get a diamond from a particular family. That's the excuse to show something like that. It just does not deserve it. Do not watch this movie. It is a great waste of time and money.
