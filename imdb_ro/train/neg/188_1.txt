This movie has beautiful landscapes. Unfortunately, he has no plot. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This movie did not have one. She spent two hours drinking a beautiful scene and never managed to do anything in it. The image tries to be artistic, but fails to pay attention to the story's fundamentals. If you love the Montana landscape and fly fishing, you will find some value in this movie, do not expect a story. There is one.
