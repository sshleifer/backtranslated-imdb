From the beginning to the end, this is the most excited movie about anything I've ever seen. Characters and interactions between the title character and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. Racetrack is a metaphor, which is so overloaded that it is limited to a cliche, but director Pollack treats every torsion as if it were something deeply important. Perhaps there is value in resuming an MSFT3000 game of scenes, such as Pacino contacting her inner females for goofy value. But even such an accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
