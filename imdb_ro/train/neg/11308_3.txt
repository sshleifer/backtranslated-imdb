<br /> <br /> Get your drinks and enjoy this defective action game. Speakman's remarkable remarkable kempo (beautiful kicks with decent sticks - poor couch) is the only quality of redemption of a movie that just complains about a bad action. The land is not half bad; just executed pretty badly. But if you see this movie for anything other than martial arts, you lose the boat entirely. And for a movie that should take place in Coreatown, too few Korean actors (even extra).
