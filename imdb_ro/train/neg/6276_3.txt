BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. It's not a slasher or full of gore. A lot of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller in France and writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) enters a strange world as her life seems to be out of control. While attending her father's birthday party (Richard Jenkins), guests are amazed when a mirror collapses on the floor for no obvious reason. Things are really strange when she confesses a woman who is the image spit on her who drives a street in London in a car identical to hers. Gina sneaks into her apartment and finds a picture of her father. She gets away and gets involved in a head of collision. Then, mysteriously, her boyfriend is not the same; being the exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust. Gina is beside her? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmares become more horrible ... is it broken? Kudos if you can figure that out ... it will not be easy. Editing could not be stricter. Enlightenment is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
