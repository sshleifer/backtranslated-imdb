Undoubtedly, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer. After all, very few today's actors can get a scene in just one go, and that's pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on the set. I feel that, as the 1960s wore, the quality of the men's movies really began to be reserved. The series of detectives Tony Rome was just trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series that came out at the same time. Maybe a James Bond competition, but nothing worked for Frank in these years. His personal life in waste, his music fading ... Sinatra appeared more like a comeback in the 1950s. The last great Sinatra film of this era was probably Von Ryan's expression in 1965.
