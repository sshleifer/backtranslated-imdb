This film is written by Charlie Higson, who made this show "Legendary" Fast Show and his own performance based on one of the Fast Show characters (Tony Car Salesman). He also wrote James Bond Children's Books. In fact, I saw earlier than Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories, and each of them is great. Here Gordon tries to do something different. Style is totally "contemporary", which means a blurry room, a quick and strange cut, a refreshing background music. It works pretty well here, I think, but it is still useless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who shakes his camera in front of the actors / actresses and tries to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping for something tolerable to get out of it). Casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere that is the result of good guidance. I think the main character, the young "zero", is quite interesting in "zeroness." The type of fat is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but he's not him. But pretty soon after the movie, it turns out to be something not so interesting: in this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this movie / story: It's totally pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say there is no humor. It's a 1'40 long spout without any relief at all. Anyway, Gordon remains one of the most exciting filmmakers that are active today and I think this movie is an experiment and a failure in that. Everyone has to experience loss at times, just to learn and find their way back. It could be Gordon's most uninteresting and naked thing.
