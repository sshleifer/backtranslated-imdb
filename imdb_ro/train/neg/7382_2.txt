Well, let me say that I have always been a Steven Seagal fan and his films are usually big, but that does not measure up to the rest. This is, in my opinion, very bad that I did not like everything. The most important reason I do not like is that it is very wrong and it does not make much sense for me. The actor is very bad even Steven Seagal is not doing well, the other actors I can see because they are directing video. He does not follow a straight story, it all happens at once, so why does that make little sense. They have no action in it and to make a good action movie, you usually need action in it. The special effects are very bad and you can say they are false. So all in all these must seagals the worst movie of all, so if you want to see a Seagal movie Steven does not rent it just claims he does not exist. <br /> <br /> General Score: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
