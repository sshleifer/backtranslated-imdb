(First of all, excuse my bad language) Of course, only a movie with Jessica Simpson can include serious babe like this. I'm Norwegian and I felt offended and shocked, the producers of this film did not have time and doing research on making this American / Norwegian film. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. So I put the corrections of my frustration: - The country is called Norway, not Norway. - Yeah, it's Russian, not Norwegian. - The Norwegian priests never use those black hats with that white paper on the neck, because the Protestant church is far-reaching - It is true that we have a native traditional folklore (which we use only twice a year), but kept in it the film is more like a German outfit. - I could not understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie. Jessica did not make any sense ... less "Norwegian priests" The only thing I've recognized is the Norwegian flag (and the hats of the Vikings, but that's so stereotyped in what people think about Norway-Vikings !: Oh, yeah) I think the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least we've eliminated some things and got rid of part of that frustration. I'm proud of my country, and I would like people in the US to be less stereotyped and more precise when they talk about this country. That was all ... Lenge leve Norge! ; p
