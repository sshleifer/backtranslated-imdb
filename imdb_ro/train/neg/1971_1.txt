This movie is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders display only a very limited music spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in certain parts of the music that the film brings that makes viewing and listening absolutely boring. The only attraction of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who had an affair with J.B. Lenoir shows his private footage and stories. Wenders' introduction to the film begins quite interesting - an allusion to the world's culture (or, in fact, American culture) traveling in space, but its limited appearance, as well as the amusing or not fascinating reproduction of stories from the 1930s make this movie as a simple sleeping aid. Yawning. I was expecting him more.
