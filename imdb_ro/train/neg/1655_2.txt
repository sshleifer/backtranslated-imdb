This film really shows the age. The print I saw was terrible because of age, but there may be better prints out there. However, this was not the major issue with the movie. The problem was that, although the film was made in 1933, it was basically a silent film in which the film was scattered (only a few sentences) in a more amateur way. Sometimes the back of the characters was back or talking with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to hide their lips, and "hidden" (?) They hid the fact that the movie was called. Well, it is true that this Czech film should be called in many languages, but to do so it was really stupid and obvious. It was just cheap. Generally, the movie seemed cheap and stupid. It is a shame, however, because it was a good story bob - a young woman marrying an elderly man who is either homosexual and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit down with this archaic mess. Even with a few glimpses of Hedy Lamarr, empty (and somewhat weird), it does not deserve all the agitation that accompanied the movie when it debuted. Even after the standards of 1933, this film was a bad dick made. The only interesting thing about the film is to see how differently Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the brilliant image that Hollywood created when it came to America - it looks like two completely different people. incomplete film and technically inferior film, I do not see how she got such coveted reviews. Only for technical problems can the film not evaluate a 10 or something close to it.
