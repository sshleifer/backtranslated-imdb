is supposed to be based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model that has become a reward hunter. I would say that 95% is made. I always keep my mind open when it comes to films; however, this film has lost its chances when it became obvious that it had a story throughout the film, something that can not resist, and at first the heroine of the story is so ugly described as an arrogant b! ch I just wanted to end with her being shot in the head. is too incoherent, too brilliant, and too boring, is a man who gives a pretty bad story and I really think big time directors have to make movies based on their own imagination or on their own imagination, not on something based on life his arm.
