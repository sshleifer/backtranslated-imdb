I bought this movie from a shop called Poundland. I was looking for more inspiration, as I previously bought No Big Deal and remodeling it. We expected this film to be insufficiently inspired to remake it and put it on the tube. However, that was shocking. CHOICE is the main word that comes to mind. Negative effects and scenario are not enough to make you look. The woman's main body seems to be pushed to the right moment in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, it makes you wonder, have the budget blown up and made her take her clothes? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the photos do not even coincide with each other and the camera is so amateur that our remake of bad movies looks professional. I can not believe that this is sold as a marketable product. It's simply UGLY to track. Actors are bad and there is not a degree of professionalism about them. There are no words describing how terrible it is.
