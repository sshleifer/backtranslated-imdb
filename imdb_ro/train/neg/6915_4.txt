This is one of those movies I remember being in pot for years before something happened to that. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is pretty good. The distribution is pretty good in what's given to you, but again you're as good as the script. Baldwin led this thing though I could swear he did not guide everything, I thought I read somewhere or that a lot of restocking was not bad, but he certainly has some potential there. Though his work on "30 Rock" is nothing of a genius and should keep him busy for a while. I just hope that the show looks gracefully at Seinfeld, but perhaps not so much. 9 years went. So if you want to see a movie from which you will not get too much but do not hate too well, this is for you. I do not remember the last time a movie was wrapped so long before it was released definitively and only on DVD at that. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins again, because their excellent people, but not many, saw it "The Edge". Now, pick up the great movie for real entertainment.
