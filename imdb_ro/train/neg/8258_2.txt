I was lucky to read the book before I saw the movie. It was an age of adolescence, a summer dream gone, a great indie potential, or big budget drama. He has somehow got into the hands of a hack who has clearly taken notes of Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The script loses the flesh of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low-leaf gag. I'm sorry for the actors because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but they were cut down to embarrassing characters in the movie. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains of the story plays as a bad after special school. Poor people = GOOD, rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although worth watching to see the South California beach where Gary Sinise parked his trailer, which is destined to cross into a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing return for Mills Goodloe director for the first time. <br /> <br />
