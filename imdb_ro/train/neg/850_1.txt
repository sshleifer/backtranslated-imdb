This has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead)! First, the plot is bad. The little kid is strange and moves to a hotel, because his father is the caretaker. We find that the baby has a gift, "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything other than to make the child look cool. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man finally cries. He goes into violence to kill the child and his wife because ... well, he feels like that. Why else would he do that? All of a sudden we see an empty woman in the tub. The man kisses and realizes that he kisses a dead body, which is absolutely disgusting. In a way, a black man enters the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black vehicle and leave the father, who dies in a few minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a waste of time, but this falls directly into that category. The music is naked, the characters are horns (except for Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and matches the description of the spitting, the end is very predictable, the story is slow, boring and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS. I'm surprised she got a rating so high on IMDb.
