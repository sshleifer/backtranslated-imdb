I think I should start this by saying that almost any style of work can be fun in the parties. The real test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analogue title for this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me who enjoy reading many blogs - that blogs can not compare to writing a good novel for many reasons. Also, the EMF can not compare to creating good films for a number of reasons, and in fact I think it is a poor example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a combined vlog. (Heck, even MySpace becomes a pimping.) If I want to see an hour of lonelygirl15 - no ... I'm going to look at her. FEM, while certainly more harsh than the bubble gum atmosphere of the above-mentioned media, is so personal that it does not have an interesting story. It's as if you see the painfulness of life, which I think most agree, is very boring. Still, FEM creators want to applaud him, their postmodern film about making a movie. Cue yawned me. Finally, I came far does not care about any of her. I am shocked that I am actually interested in taking the time to write this review even. It's not that FEM is really stupid, because it's not; has a few moments when I smash a smile or think maybe - maybe only - something interesting will happen. It is rather a language ... mediocre. I feel so irrespective of the fact that it matches almost an oxymoron: passionate indifference. I hope that filmmakers / "actors" get rid of the debt from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them moves away and moves alive. Watch this movie if you have time to miss and much you want to do; otherwise, pass it and do not worry about losing a large, undiscovered talent. You did not do it.
