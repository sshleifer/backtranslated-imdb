My wife and I have rented this movie because some people have pulled parallel between it and the "office space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had a "recommended" selection if you liked "Office Space". Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I like. It's probably one of the 10 favorite movies. Cute, humorous and with characters that remind me of the people I've been working with over the years. "The Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space," meaning both films. This is where the similarity ends. We probably sat in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving her the benefit of the doubt, hoping she would not pray that it would be better. She did not. We could not take it anymore and stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rental. I would have liked to have paid for it. We should be reimbursed because we have to stand by it. Now, since I have not seen the end, maybe it will happen miraculously and it will be redeemed. I doubt. The Haiku tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe it has ever been produced. The movie is so dysfunctional, it's painful. Send only friggin letters! The premise is asinin. The banks are terrible. We have come to the scene "the printer does not work" and had to stop. I could not take that anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. If you are a fan of Office Space ...... do not waste time with this turret. 0/10
