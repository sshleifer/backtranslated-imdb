Before the release of George Romero's "Night of the Dead", the zombies were relatively well-composed creatures. They certainly had much better manners in the old days. But the social label does not take away what emotions these early zombies made for the cinema audience? Judging by this film, none of it. The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefaction. One party discovers secrets on its own and setstles about building its zombie army. This movie is basically a triangle of zombie love. But seeing that this is the 30-year film, named zombies are rather somnambulists than the variety that eats the flesh we think of today. They seem to respond to mind control, rather than to reckless appetite. And, frankly, the revolt is somewhat overwhelming. Everything is very boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there is no melodramatic theater above the top to keep our fun. It seems unlikely that this would have given much fun 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with "zombie" in the title, but otherwise I would advise to skip this.
