I always liked Spike Lee's movies, but it was a total loss of 2Â½ hours. I expected more of Sam's Son and instead of getting a movie that seemed to have little to do with the crimes of the 1977 series. The talking dog was ridiculous (you know you have problems when all filmmakers broke out laughing improperly). The entire movie seemed very dislocated and not very interesting. The sexual scenes were totally irrelevant to the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but it should have a point (unless it's a XXX movie). Overall, we were very disappointed with this effort Spike Lee!
