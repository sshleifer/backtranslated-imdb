This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. The only bizarre one is SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour prayer through a strange world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes an unusually weird Casanova, and weird journeys in a series of vignettes that are not related to the great amateur autobiography fail to engage the spectator. The art direction and costume design are, however, EXTREME. The academy failed to nominate the first, but to do justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (strange) was the disjointed, useless and almost inaccessible scenario. Realize! The video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original time. This viewer was grateful.
