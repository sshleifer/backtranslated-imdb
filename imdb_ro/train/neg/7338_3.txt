I watched this film hoping to find a pretty interesting story, but the story line was not at all good. The actors' game was not better. Of course Shahrukh Khan was there, but it was not enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting. I read that this film is based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary," but for me I did not see it fit with the Indian mentality. Generally, we buy the movie to dream and have good time, do not waste time and change our mood worse. I can not understand how such a "high" vote could be achieved with an average of 6.8 / 10. So it's kind of a movie on which you should run and ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! You will just waste your time if you do not like the "dark movie" with "strange and meaningless story".
