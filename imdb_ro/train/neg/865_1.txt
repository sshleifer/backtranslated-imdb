I had the misfortune of staying in full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shocking bad movie. It fails on almost all levels; the movie is terrible, the act - the ham in the best case and the plot does not have depth, let me feel violently apathetic regarding the outcome of any complicated story line. Plan B has no charm this genre has the sphere to convey and I found myself physically cringing at different points if the script does its usual meandering misjudged anywhere in the comedy region. A nude bona fide covered with saccharine of a film.
