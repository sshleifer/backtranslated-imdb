This is a very stupid film in the typical genre of the '80s: comedy action. Specifically, it resembles Ora Rush, but completely lacks action, laughter and chemistry among the main characters of that film. Let's know I like Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just can not act. He's terrible when he tries to act hard - he barely manages to keep that smirk mark on his face, while saying that his un-liniers, which by the way, I'm not very funny. And seeing him run (even then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least through current standards - does not give a fair political impression to the Japanese. I do not even understand the story. I give 2 out of 10.
