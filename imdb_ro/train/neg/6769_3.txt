A failure. The movie was not good. It's humor like those 5 years who will not even giggle. I mean, sure, some parts were fun, but most are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and should work on better movies. The movie should have been broadcast as an original Disney Channel movie, which is FREE. The only thing that was good about this movie was music. Nothing like a remodeled rock soundtrack that lights up your day. These songs are so good. Especially the tracks of Alyson and Amanda Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter, the Beach Boy fun, fun Fun 4 out of 10. If I gave her a 10, 9 of which would be music and 1 would be the movie. It's not worth the money, but the soundtrack is.
