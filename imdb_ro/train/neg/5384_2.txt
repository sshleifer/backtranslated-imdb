All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are angry because they can not release their movie through a main distributor? Therefore, they do it alone. Otherwise, film hype does not justify the film's content. The story is absent and could be slightly short. The actress is weak, but the animation and the music are pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste your time - I do not think hype! However, if you have the chance to see the movie for free, do so. Then you will not have to lose money. However, directors are doing a good job of pushing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. Otherwise, I'm a wonderful one who has never had a shot.
