There is little to say about this, but I can mention that Matt Dillon does everything in his power to do something out of nothing, as well as the many separate and graphic screens he deserves. Because most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not so intelligent, we get to such films. Lindsay Lohan, who was so surprised at Mean Girls, has to make better decisions about what roles to take. It can only fail here. Children will only be entertained because they try to appeal more to adults than to children (though still bad enough). Those in the theater I saw did not show any real interest in minutes. And as a family sports movie this is horrible. Better moments are from the beginning to the escape that creates a feeling and later in the self-bash fest that creates a certain tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you need to develop it better than here. After some mandatory racing scenes, you are in the best part: you can leave the multiplex in your own car.
