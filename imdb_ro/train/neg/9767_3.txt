I think that if you are in the genre of sixty years, as I am, you are forced to lose about 80 minutes of your life in pursuit of this barely seen work. The redemptive graces of this oddity include a surprisingly social commentary of the sixties, alongside a number of relatively well-known actors captured in the early (and embarrassing) material. It's like the Laugh-In producers sat down and decided to write a long-lasting film covering all the high points (and more) of the problems between the flower children and the institution, then put it in the hands of a few hippies and gave them a $ 10,000 budget to complete it. It is not a classic, but in its own way it captures how odd was time, stupidity, super-idealism and rigidity of unity. Obviously not for everyone.
