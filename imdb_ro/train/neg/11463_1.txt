This is just a response to yahoo that says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, the brain, large whites (and other species of sharks, bulls, black peaks, ocean peaks, tiger) have been known to populate areas where mild booty is found. People often do not like this menu, but they are given, but the shark in the film has been repeatedly underlined that it has abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The chances of a killer whale, destroying almost a whole city, separating a human nemesis, sinking several dozen North American North American fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all the friends of the "nemesis" mentioned above, are pretty close to water for him to arrive, they are so thin as to be ridiculous. Just like this knockout of a jaws. Ridiculous. The big white shark is also known to frequently chew on boats, underwater protection cages and people on rafts and surfboards because they look like seals underneath. A Bruce's shark (if you do not know, look for it) would be more than able to sink a boat like The Orca (hey, that's the name of the rip-off that we're talking about!) That weigh in up to 6000 lbs. I can go on, but I do not have to. Jaws is amazing (better action, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is stupid (BLATANT of jaws, written scorn, abominable effects, the most ridiculous plot on this part of an Olson Twins movie ). He does not need a Masters degree from Columbia University to see that. Watch better movies.
