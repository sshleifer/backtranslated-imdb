Just when I thought I'd end a whole year without giving a single movie a "Bomb" rating, a friend brought me that famous night in my house last night. I was afraid the worst knew his reputation and it was as awful as God, as I had anticipated. This is a misery made by Mexican, named in English by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects and has a Santa Claus that does not operate at the North Pole but instead of a cloud in outer space and who does not have small elves to help him make his toys but rather all different groups children from almost all countries exist. The opening sequence, in which St. Nick chuckled stubbornly, observing the monitors that show that all the kids who work hard while singing holiday songs in different languages ​​seem to go forever and without stories. Obviously, this Santa Clause does not respect child labor laws! Finally, we will get a bad evil slinky disciple of the devil, who travels from hell to the earth, just to make small children naughty and turn the Santa Claus rounds into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a tripty and twisted experience and is bound to scare small children and turn them off Santa Claus and holidays forever. Strangely, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which somehow makes all the scary in the context of all the bizarre things that happen. This easily makes my personal list of the movie "The Worst Movie I Have Ever See", but I'm sure it's nothing unique.
