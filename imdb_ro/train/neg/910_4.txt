The story line was very simple and easy to follow and contained a lot of mind-free comedy up to a point where she was just bored. Some of the spectators looked funny, but I liked smarter humor. There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film, and their interpretation was decent, given the scenario. Lena Endre was fine as always. I do not remember the original movie, so I can not tell if it's better or worse. If you enjoy movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth a look at.
