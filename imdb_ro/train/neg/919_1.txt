Although I must admit that I laughed more by watching this movie than the last comedies we've seen. The budget must have been to change the pocket of the actors. Production values ​​are so low that they have made it really fun to watch. She reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. In a scene, an unfortunate victim gathers his arm and leg. Gosh, hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene at Black Grail was more realistic. I was wondering why the victim did not start crying: "No one will pass" and "It's just a wound in the flesh, I've got worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last year. The "Gladiator / Demon" was also a stitch. Between the horrible costume and the inexpensive suit of the guy in it, the end result was hysterical. Indeed, a bad enough movie to be watched. Something to see a slow auto-motion accident on the film. <br /> <br />
