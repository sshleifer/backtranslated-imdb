Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor at Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the cinema industry only if he does not get a kind of creative control. He plays an annoying character of peppy that basically breaks off so slowly and slowly. Do you want to know the only funny parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, his surrender to me is fun. Nothing else is. Especially when you realize that he is trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he should not try because he is one. And yet, its fragment of "demolition of the veterinary office" is lost as an evil. This movie made me give an eye. Avoid it at all costs and continue to watch SNL.
