OK is not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I've been able to sit and see it twice! the story story was pretty awful and in the first part of the first story I asked what the hell I was watching, but at the same time it was so terrible I loved cheating cheap all the way. Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this film, the only thing that left him down was halfway through the road to stopping his stupid name. Generally, the movie was quite perfect, but if your after cheap laugh and you see it in the land of pound go for it.
