Råzone is a terrible movie! It's so simple. They seem to have tried to make a movie to show the life of the bobbins. Like Zappa, many years ago. But, unfortunately, Denmark has no good young actors. Leon is a very little girl from "Krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie he plays with his soul and this destroys the movie! Even though I think it's a movie that you should see. I do not agree that young people behave like this, but I think they can show how it can end if you let the child fall. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies like "Folk Film"! All I think people should see Råsone. Not because it's a great movie, it's because it's a movie that deals with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are violent scenes in the scene, and in fact, in these scenes, Laura works best. - like the end in which she holds the gun!
