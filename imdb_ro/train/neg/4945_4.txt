Sure, this is not really a blockbuster, nor is it aimed at such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a quite popular German musician who is loved or nasty for his genre of acting and about which is exactly this film. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen", written a few years ago, but is not meant to be exact in this respect. The film is full of sexually offensive content (at least for the American standard), which is either funny (not for the other "actors" of course) or bad - it depends on your individual humor type or the fact that you are a "Bohlen "-Fan or not. From a technical point of view, there is not much to criticize. Speaking of me, I find this movie a good movie.
