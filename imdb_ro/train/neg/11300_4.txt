He watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The third universal movie of the mummy is the same as the first two to the end from the perspective of the spectator. The story is similar, and the results are ho-hum. This time, the story of the story is in the US, while the new survivor of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country hoping to revive him to kill the descendants of the original tomb. This time, the mummy is interpreted by Lon Chaney (who does not make the difference because he did not have to act much for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue in the city and sends the mummy to do his dirty work after feeding his juice from the tan leaves. Again, a girl comes in the way, while the priest falls for one of the descendant's fianc√© and wants her - to be immortal with him (did not hear that before?). The plan is, of course, thwarted as the city dwellers hunt the mummy with torches (resembling the Frankenstein monster), and burning the creature ends the story ... how do I get a sequel? I think you'll learn the next one in the series? or not.....
