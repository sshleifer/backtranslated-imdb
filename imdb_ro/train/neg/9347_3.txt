This film revolves from an indulgent moment to an indulgent moment, the promise to develop into something worthwhile to hang. But no. He is flat, self-conscious, unimaginable and boring. A series of set pictures and backgrounds do not make a movie, they make a calendar. This type of pseudo-dramatic socialist pitiful documentary ("True indeed happened"), not only fails to entertain, but fails to convince, so it does not even work as a social history. Clich√©s co-mingled with a bad act makes this movie a very difficult film to finish, simply a fun factor quite quickly. Characters are dimensional, never develop to the extent that they feel for them. The ego of the director is the greatest character in this film.
