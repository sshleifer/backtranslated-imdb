This movie was recommended as a good action movie, which I do not think it is. I have discovered the complicated story and not so easy to follow. It's not that much action until the end of the movie and it's pretty dark and hard to see what's really going on. Of course we were hoping for something different, but unfortunately we did not find it here.
