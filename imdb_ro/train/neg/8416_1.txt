It seems logical to me that this movie is made by Hollywood raves, because many times in Hollywood everything is just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think people who prefer the movie can react to countless songs that spits you rather than to the content of the story. However, this film is overstated and overstated. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. No Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles perform the Oscar-nominated performances, so many of them overturned before the movie came out. I can not even believe that Condon is set up to be nominated for the Oscars as director when all he did was an album. Glitz does not replace a story anything. A bunch of songs do not make a movie.
