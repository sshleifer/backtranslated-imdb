Back in 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, far or near. Trying to finish a THX movie, etc. this short is a remanufactured history of a particular George. I'm sorry he only has to defend him. This is just an ad for the director, actors, et. Al. It has an intrinsically low artistic value. It's a brochure. George's leadership is very good, like Leia's character and Darth's character. All others are commercial slag. What a waste. Still, I did my job. The rest of the film just trotting with water to kill time I think. just a brochure.
