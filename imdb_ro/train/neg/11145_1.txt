Where to start? . . . I feel ... broken! It's right, broken! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours, that I could have spent something more useful, as if I had seen the dry paint on this so-called horror movement. It's not scary, it's not funny. it's not dramatic, it's not action, it's nothing ... Predictable, boring, tragic ... I might be a bit tough here, but be this movie and you'll feel the same way ... or ... , you do not watch him ... unless you want to feel violated as well.
