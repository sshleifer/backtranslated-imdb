One of the other commentators mentioned that they almost came out. If I had not been with my wife who wanted to stay, I would have gone. It's a shame, too, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the most disadvantaged scenarios I have ever seen. It starts nowhere and does not go anywhere (I would say it does not go anywhere quickly, but it does not work slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are indications that something interesting might happen or that there is a certain depth under one of the characters, but that's all we have - suggestions. There is no single payment or revelation in the whole movie. Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained ... I like a well-meandering character study, just as much as the next indie buff. But these characters add to nothing. Throughout the movie you do not care what happens to yourself. In fact, you almost begin to hope to die, because at least one death may be more interesting than observing their inexplicable behavior, which is so odd and unpredictable that you think it would be convincing, but it is not. Instead of strange characters, hot noir-esquire, you instantly recognize it for what it is: a bunch of talented actors but shaken, thick and raised eyebrows while reading the bizarre dialogue without a clue of context relevant. All this for two plodding, painful slow hours. Awful.
