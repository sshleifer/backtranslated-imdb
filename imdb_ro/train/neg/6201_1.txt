I saw him. It is not "good" but interesting in an undervalued way. The guys in her are quite naturalistic, but ... ... the final scenography of free / free kidnapping is reproached and - and yes - the arbitrary insertion of the Second World War movie is offensive in the way it tries to compare the real horror with this misogynist creature. Real atrocity is real - this movie is just atrocious. However, the movie has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me to be "the Emperor's new apparel," but in fact the other way around. The movie looks good, but the direction, story, content, and ultimate feeling you're taking away from this movie is empty. If a feeling can be empty - that's it.
