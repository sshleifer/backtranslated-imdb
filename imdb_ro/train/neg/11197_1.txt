What was the worst movie since 2003? "The cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I want to be this little atrocious movie from the beginning of the year. Very written, poorly drafted and (if they can be so daring) have acted badly, the "Order" is the black hole of the movie - a film so dense that even little entertainment can not escape the event horizon of sucking. It's not even funny, like "Showgirls". You know that the producers assume their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally titled "Sinners Sin", because they thought Americans were too stupid to understand what a sinner was, even if they went a long way to explain what a pussy is in the movie. Instead, they think of an absolutely generic title and a look of Heath Ledger that looks scary is more than enough to get there. And, what you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw Heath's image and dragged me in. Congratulations, manufacturers, you've met your target market. She also liked "Grease II," so you're in a good company. Back to the topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a certain order (you guessed it) who is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has problems of celibacy, probably because no one in their mind would think he knew the slightest thing about religion, except that he is a celibate monk. The only member of this order is a funny type of alcoholic fat. As much as I wanted to see the funny alcoholic return on the big screen, his humorous attempts reminded me of all the dorks in my high school that made imitations of Monty Python, thinking that if they only said the Pythons it would have been funny. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. If I speak, I would be in danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that ruined this movie for me was that it was created.
