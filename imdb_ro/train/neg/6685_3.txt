Although the film takes place at an "Ivy League" college, it was shot entirely in North Arizona, especially North Arizona University in Flagstaff in the autumn of 1976. I was involved in the theater department there and most of the film extracts are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely absurd scene in this movie (if you know the Arizona geography) that shows some members castcasting bicycles from college to a creek. We, the NAU, know that the campus and the creek mentioned (in fact, Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles away, and while the trip is on the descent, it would be literally impossible to drive the bike back on the same road!
