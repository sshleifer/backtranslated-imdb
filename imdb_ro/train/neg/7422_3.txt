Well, I could not go into the plot, but maybe that's all. Unusual movie camera movements sometimes, however, this film has a charming time of quality. The actor is authentic and sometimes fun with the occasional tracking sequence that involves ladies dressed up quickly, which was beautiful. The climax is confusing and disjoint, but still ... riveting error, much more than Stella Stevens. The waterfalls are exciting, especially because of the las vegas background of the '70s. There are some movements of hand movements that keep me guessing for a while. But I do not think I'm going to watch the DVD right now.
