Good. this was not a surprise. many people will tell you that this is upsetting. but they all talk "shiztz" this movie is very slow. Begin with a guy who makes a chocolate to feel no pain that he calls "my son," there are some gorilla scenes, but I found them weak. you could go over 40 minutes of the film and get to the stage of the eyeball that was surprisingly impressive and bad. there are some really stupid scenes in this regard. and they operate over blows and hands with a stupid sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. Keep your gore seekers. Check out if you want a 20-10 minute ending scene that's still not so stunning and has a random scene of the guy trying to like mother rape .. yes it's weird.
