I brought this movie as a joke to a friend and it could be the worst joke to play. The film is just being watched, and the act is terrible. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff offering substandard performance. Crying is shameful, and at times when we were so bored, we were wondering what the hell was going on. He's trying to be terrible in places, but he's just ridiculous. Just terrible
