The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. This is the weirdest thing. When I sat down to see this, I thought how bad was the fourth and the fifth, she should have been good after the terrible. The boy was wrong. Incredibly wrong. When I looked in the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to stop it, but I thought it was not, maybe it would improve. Not only is it a terrible movie in itself, it did not need a sequel, because the last two (the fourth and the fifth) had already been quite terrible! Also, how many times can you bring back Freddy! Action in it was TERRIBLE, the story line was predictable and bad, and it also had flaws in it. The way they did Springwood was completely wrong. He does not pay any respect to the former. To add to this, everything seemed really overhead. Some say this movie was "funny." This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I'd say it's stupid. This movie should be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, would not that information be shown in the first one? The end was also stupid and stupid, just like the rest. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the former. Just show up. Such a shame that Wes Craven has created something so good at first, however, it has to be pulled down because of this trash that's part of the trash. He should not even have made this film. None of the other sequences, except for the third one. The third is the only decent of all sequels. If it was a DVD in itself and it's not part of the DVD Nightmare On Elm Street DVD I received, I'd chuck it when I resisted. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pitiful and bad attempt to continue. <br /> <br /> - A complete MOCKER of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please do not waste your time with this worthless junk.
