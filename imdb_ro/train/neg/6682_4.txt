This comedy is not really funny. It's a story that plays so much on stereotypes that it has no impact. It's a derivative of a cow movie - yes, even then - it does not have a moment. Distribution is appropriate. More than that is hard to say. However, what is nice is that the players are not familiar. At MGM, this would have played with Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who had no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses. We can be grateful for the fact that this little known film is populated by artists who are now unknown today. And the values ​​of production are not terrible. However, it has no real impression. It's a generic knockoff. And who wants it?
