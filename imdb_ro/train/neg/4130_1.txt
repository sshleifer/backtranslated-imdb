A top contestant for the worst film ever made. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have an I.Q. of 3, which is only one smaller than the writer and the director. The script would not have gone into a high school classroom; "jokes" are minor; the corny concept. These artists were clearly desperate to work. I'm only left to see if it gets worse. Did. Life is too short to spend some of it watching this movie.
