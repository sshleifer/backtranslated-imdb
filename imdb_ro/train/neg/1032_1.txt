While I was never the original Scooby-Doo fan (due to his horrible production values), he seems to be Shakespeare, compared to Hanna-Barbera's pile of nonsense! Undoubtedly, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and horrible character created for children (including Teletubbies as well as Tommy Tapeworm). Who was the brilliant idea to create a kind of short mutant dog and allow him to talk and then cheat with it the Scooby-Doo characters? Anyone who deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unhappy, annoying and grilling on the nerves - and this is only in Episodes Better! After many years, it would have been better to end the franchise than to create this mess! I can see why in the Scooby-Doo movie they made Scrappy-Doo bastard - since virtually everyone hates it!
