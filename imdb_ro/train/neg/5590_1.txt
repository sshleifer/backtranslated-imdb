Horrible movie. About an old, crusting painter who gets stuck with a young girl. Boring. Tatum Neil goes through the moves on her side and has some of the most corny lines in the history of the film. Richard Burton is near death in this film and we should think he looks "good for sixty". The act is bad, so does the plot. The characters are terrible, just like the story. It's very hard to feel for someone in this movie, except for Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, it's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, like me - that's why I rented it in the first place - please do not see this movie. It's very bad in it and you wonder if maybe the Pope's Month was a fluke. It was not because BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS know it can play well, but still do not rent this movie. And if you're a Burton fan, rent something when it looks good, not a fossil.
