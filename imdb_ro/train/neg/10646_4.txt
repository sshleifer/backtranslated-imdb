The last of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films and a good thing, because this is slightly the worst of the 12 films he has made in 16 years. No mermaid is presented here, be it a beautiful island trying to escape the claws of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be her bride. Finds Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially evil priest, but he is not used to his full advantage. Also handy and worthy of note is an extremely annoying guitarist who plays in songs so often. Even the "great" Robert Florey can not help. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
