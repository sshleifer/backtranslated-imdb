Action movie Cheezy with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a military man who retired to a teaching post. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student's body left him frustrated, and he decided to suspend it. Things get worse when, while looking over a bunch of students in detention, some robbers take over school as a base for operating an armed robbery car. Dolph his versus baddies in a fight to death. Removal of the throat throws back to the late-night exploits, where the bad guys dressed like punks, and some of the bad women had their shiny day hair. What a bad movie. Can be seen in a movie that does not believe that people did this, it is an action movie that was probably doomed to go before the low budget, the false sets of separation and the weak direction of action were even a blinking in the eyes of a manufacturer. Watch how late in the movie that driving cars through school (do not ask) collapse in the security turret (do not ask, because it looks more like a jail then a high school) and breaks its shape barely built out does not look like in previous photos). What did the gods do for the bad movies? In fact, I was amazed by the fact that he was directed (?) By Sydney J Furie, a very good director who made movies like The Boys in Company C. His ability hesitated, or he was hopeless to go and do not even bother? It's turkey. One that can be traced, but a turkey, though.
