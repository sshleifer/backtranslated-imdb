This film rivals "Plan 9" as one of the worst films ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western stuntmen. Maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here's just an example of the film: In the movie, the sheriff must take a witness to another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys find out and wait for them. But what is happening? The good boys walk along the road and hit a tree beside them. When the room shows the bad guys, everyone is sitting in a diary, talking. What's wrong with this image! We could go further. Perhaps this film was considered a comedy. If so, he did not do that well.
