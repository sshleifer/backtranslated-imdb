I made my personal assignment to go after those responsible for this movie. I even have the rental company to give me the money back because I claimed to have falsely advertised. It's not enough that the movie itself is a p.o., but the art of coating is what it sold to me. I've done better makeup effects on my kids at Halloween than what the film really describes about the cover. Can you say "the eyes of the raccoon"? I will not waste any more of my time by going into the full details, but come on, the main character of the movie is an LA policeman who was born and raised in Alabama - but he has a German accent! It's beyond insulting.
