The problems with this movie are many, but I will try to mention the brightest and disturbing ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a series of winemaking about life in Manhattan, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and television, was something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or non-existent, and practically every scene, camera photography, the dialogue line and the emotion expressed was absolute and totally false. Eventually I got to a point after an hour of garbage that miraculously died that I came out (something unusual for me in recent years.) I would have guessed that the movie was directed by some apologists who gave up I think the director (at one time pre-Amelia, talented), Mira Nair, took part in this disgusting tragedy, so perhaps directorial talent in America has descended en masse in the tank.
