I rented this by mistake. I thought, after a brief review of the tape, that it was a time / SF travel story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story and I think it's a pretty typical example. If you sold your message, you will probably overlook the plot / acting / weirdness, but it seemed quite painful to me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I'm disturbed by the history rewriting in this story. He paints the 1890s as a paradise of family values ​​and morality (a character is assaulted that 5% of marriages end in divorce!). But he considers very disadvantaged aspects of this "high moral" society (rigid, racial, sexual discrimination and social discrimination has been widespread, for example). And at one point, the hero complains to a garment store owner about things that are not so different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ) . Generally, think about it, I guess it's the kind of thing you'll want if you like this kind of thing and it's certainly healthy ...
