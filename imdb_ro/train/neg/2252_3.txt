So I heard from some people that this movie brought tears to the theater. As I first saw him, I was waiting for a romantic tear-film, Barbra Streisand; Something like the Way I was. I was definitely wrong. The chemistry of the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her, John Howard, does not exist, making it impossible to attach to the characters. It was not romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic addict who could not sing a single note without making me want to push the button fast forward. At one point, the character finds her husband in bed with another woman, and she forgives him five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a red star and a woman who can not figure out until she dies. Parts of the film seemed to be pulling and going on, and I always wondered when it would end. John Howard's death was completely predictable. It was an absolutely obvious presence of his reckless behavior in the film, and when he died he felt no emotion. It was not a tragic accident, he was basically an idiot. Not to mention the movie, I was distracted by his hideous beard. The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The end of the movie when playing "More Look at You / Watch it Close" was my reason to give this movie a 3/10 enormous. The 7 minutes were the only part of the movie, in fact, I felt a different emotion than the irritation and anger.
