I was attracted to seeing this film because of this plot and my desire to look horrified. To my disappointment, this turned into a comedy rather than a horror. The actor, the dialogue and the flow of the film were very wrong. Much of it made no sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people and everyone is terrified by one person, despite being in a secret location and all healthy young adults, and the guy who threatens them is bloody. I always thought, maybe it was a parody of another movie, like Scary Movie, but they tried too hard to make it terrible - the focus on the test. Blood and gore are also badly made. I saw Halloween costumes showing more credible than that. A guy with cut-off head ... looks clean - missing signs of bones, flesh, blood, and even his head. A strong blow down, with an ax on a corpse, should sit in something ... it seemed that man was batting a bat instead of an ax. Discovering who should be a twist, but has contradicted other parts of the story. What happened to the guy's mind to come back like that? If it were a twist, you should build at least until it adds mystery and suspense.
