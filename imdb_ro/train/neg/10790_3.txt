First of all, I am not a big fan of the contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because the common pattern of creating box office success is by undercut. This film is not an artistic masterpiece to deal with taboo, as the director and marketing announcements suggest. In my opinion, the only purpose of this film is to make money by touching a sensible moral (in fact, it is considered especially taboo in the native country). Inexpensive populism could offer a brief definition of what I wanted to say. <br /> <br /> However, the act is almost perfect. In fact, most of the play has a theatrical background and has tried hard to compensate for what was missing the Altioklar; talent! All the members of the formation were perfectly suited to their roles and qualified well for the workplace, even the less experienced. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation, just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Besides, he is just a media monkey, who is supposedly a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that consists exclusively in treating naked / naked women. And just because the media boast, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and something real artistic, I look forward to applaud the future work. Hope, this time you manage to make an artistic approach. In short; Pro> Good action, hot women (just joking!) :) Cons> Everything alone, other than distribution
