I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I kept the feeling that I was watching a movie for children. I honestly believe that someone wrote a pg scenario and then, while filming, decided to add blood, nudity and language. it was a great disappointment. there is the magic of the children that exist in movies like "babe" (pig) or "angels in the field" that overcomes the evil tooth fairy. parents come to believe their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and use this ability to defeat the supernatural fairy. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to the terrible dark falls; somehow manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but no. they have made a worse movie and will probably lose the same amount of money lost in the dark.
