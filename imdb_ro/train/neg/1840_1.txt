This must be the most brutal "crazy" comedy I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a homeless man can not make me laugh? Something must be wrong with this image. This is the only movie I've ever felt like going out. I used free passes and felt like I wanted my money back. I can say with all my heart that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. THE. NO MORE. worse. movie. I laughed a little at the jolly scene, and that's all. Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should bring you more than a laugh, right? I do not know, I think filmmakers believed that the "flank" was a funny word or something. And the other joke is really to beat a dead horse - literally.
