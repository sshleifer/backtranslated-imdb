The end of the world is an unstoppable film, which is weird, because it is supposed to be the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I do not know exactly what kind. He has two jobs in a government unit (?) Guarded by four security men. His first job is to monitor transmissions to and from space (although this seems rather a hobby he does when he does not work at work # 2). Job # 2 asks him to put on a protective suit and enter a dark room ... at least that's the best thing I can imagine. It seems that the "plant" is not exactly top secret, just as the scientist brings his wife there. She gets stuck (headed for dinner) while discovering a message from space: the major interruption of the earth, always repeated. He says something about being the first message in the space he has ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they'll be late at the party. So they go out and go to the party (!?!). Later, he notes that China suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... nowhere! Yeah, Christopher Lee is in it, but that does not help too much. In addition, Lee is performing poorly in parallel with his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid items that you might want to suffer once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-sci-fi. In addition, many images of the earth have been destroyed.
