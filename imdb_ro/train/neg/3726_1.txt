I was forced to see the whole series of movies as a small child and I was told I was REALLY! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less scared by Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is good only for people who believe in this ridicule and who want to indoctrinate the children to believe the same. Besides the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also bad action, bad writing and "special effects". They are just around terrible terrible movies. Yes, credible (and terrible) for a child, but I can not imagine an increased purchase in this shlock. Although, I have to say, I would be interested to see them today as an adult. He may have a certain midnight / cult movie.
