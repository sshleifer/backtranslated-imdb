Universal Soldier: The return is not the worst movie ever made. No, this honor should go to a movie that tried to make a statement or perform an artistic act, but it failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. However, maybe none of the movies I've seen have tried so little and managed as completely as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a science fiction / action transvestity that has almost nothing to recommend. The actor is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, someone even connected to this movie should be ashamed of themselves. USA: The return makes Van Damme's previous price seem like a cinematic masterpiece. Some movies are so bad, they're good. Believe me when I tell you it's not one of them. I'm really not sure what to say here. I doubt that many people were considering seeing this movie if they had not already, but only if: no.
