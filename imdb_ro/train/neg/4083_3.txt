I saw this movie when it was released, and my dissatisfaction with it stayed with me all these years. <br /> <br /> That's why: Greenaway's goal seems to be to take each literary image into the Tempest and make it literal. If there was to say a character, "my heart will fly," it would have shown us a real human heart with attached pigeon wings that throws on the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes for some lush paintings, but ultimately it's an easy exercise. And he gets boring to death. I do not disturb the pleasure of other viewers found in this movie, but it is worth noting that not everyone in the audience was defeated.
