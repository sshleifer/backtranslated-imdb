I did not know it was a silent film with a narrative. I do not care about silent movies - horn humor, flicker of light and film, etc. I'm sure to assign the low score I've assigned. It was about Chapter 8 before finding any interest in this story, and if we had popcorn, maybe I threw it on the screen. Maybe this is addressed to the science fiction crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people one Friday night and in the whole theater there were a total of 6 people. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this film - the pleasure of the film. No one has allowed to comment on how much he enjoyed this, nor did he appreciate the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
