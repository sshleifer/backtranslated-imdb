I really do not think of anything good to say about this movie ... no one thing. The script is a nightmare. The writer fades the line between the chemical and biological features and does not seem to understand the difference. You'd think they'd get at least one technical advisor. The performances were bad for most of the casting ... although they do not really blame them ... the material even smells. Editing was just as bad. I'll stop now ... everything bad 2/10
