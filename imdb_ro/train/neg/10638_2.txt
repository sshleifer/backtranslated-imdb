Proof that everything Tarantino does not turn into gold. This is the safest plastic all the way. It is easy to see that, without Quentin's involvement, this would probably be on the shelf for years, supposing it would have been produced first and foremost. It's a woman with a fascination of death, who has a clean job after crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better than the serial killer who keeps Jones at work! All in all the poor.
