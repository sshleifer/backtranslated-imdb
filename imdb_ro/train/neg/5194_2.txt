Do not get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. I'm going away now. The writing, however, was unrealistic. A PTA mother dealing with drugs, but she's adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of a minor. Save me. The beauty of Mary Louise Parkers's beautiful character was an insult to my intelligence. Characters were not at all pleasant. Practically, the plot lines did not go anywhere. I understand my only TV field. The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker should be a wonderful mother and I should believe that ... WHY ???? I just had the feeling that I was preached by a hopeful show. They say it's okay to cheat your wife, but someone with legal age. OK not exactly the same, but I think you will get my point of view. The fact that it saves things for children is great for campaigning, I think, but it does not have water in a cable sitcom about a suburban mother as a local dealer.
