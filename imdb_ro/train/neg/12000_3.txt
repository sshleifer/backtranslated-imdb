The only way you can enjoy this movement is to knock your head on the wall, allow internal brain haemorrhage, let a bunch of brain cells die and once you're officially mentally retarded, then you can probably enjoy this movie . The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of taxi driver and was also the British girl. Perhaps if they had created the entire movie about their Indian escapades and how they would fall in love they would eventually make a much more pleasant film. The only reason I gave her a rating of 3 is that of Govida and his ability to act as a comedian. Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. In addition, the Heathrow scene of the meeting was too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post-September world, Anil Kapoor would have been shot long before he even reached the bridge of heaven to confess his true love :) But again the point of the film was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the audience * GENERAL *. Look at your own danger. At least I know I was shaken for life :(
