This is a very strange movie ... I did not know what this is all about, some people in London find a little baby in the woods that everyone thinks is a kind of oracle and makes them all, change something about their lives, which usually ends in disaster. The film ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me feeling quite dissatisfied, almost disturbed by the futility of everyone. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them have the chance to fall in love with the viewer. What was the message? Am I brilliant? It was too strange. What's going on with Runner? Why is he shooting Emilio? ... that had absolutely no meaning, useless. Can anyone help me understand this disorder of a movie?
