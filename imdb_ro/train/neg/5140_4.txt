Demer Daves is a great director when it comes to the West and the "wandering arrow" remains in everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, he should leave it to people such as Vincente Minelli, George Cukor, or fabulous Douglas Sirk. The scenario is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while watching such a loud beep. Natalie Wood's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who may think that black is Susan Kohner's daughter was more credible in the "imitation of life"), and Sinatra and Curtis I get parts so stereotyped that they can not do anything with them: the poor and the good and the sergeant-good guy. Guess who will fall in love with Natalie? France is shown as a country of tolerance, where inter-racial trade unions are warm. At that time (around 1944) it was dubious, it is still for the narrower people you can find here and everywhere.
