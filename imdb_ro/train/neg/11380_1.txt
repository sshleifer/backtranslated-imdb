When I first saw Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that in each episode, this show tries to teach you how to behave, which is good / bad. Episodes became predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again, we see a hyper-intelligent boy beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: boy and girl. Also, this show has no logic. A super-modern robot that works on two AA-size batteries and can use lots of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactive modes. We see two different robots and refuse the main idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn to behave in human society"
