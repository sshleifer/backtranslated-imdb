I see what the director tried to do, but he lost the sign. The main actor was very good, but editing around his moments takes you out of it. Working with the room, that is, the lighting and the exhibit, is a kind of amateur I could forgive if the direction was more fluent, but it was not. The sound was a bit out and that's getting you out of the movie as well. I saw that this director could do a little better in the future, so it's not gonna be okay, but do not expect a movie as good as 28 days or so, wait a little wait and you will get more out of it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh, yes, other than driving the act was bad enough if you ask me. But I'm a film snob, so take that for what it deserves.
