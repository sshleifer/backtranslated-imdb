I've recently watched this movie twice, and I do not understand why the producers have made this pile of nonsense. I mean, yes, it gives a good impression of Hitler's environment and I mean how they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, World War I and the interwar period. What I can not understand is the reason why they imagined Hitler as a pure 100% pure, insane, uncertain, strangely unstable mentally. He was, after all, a very attentive, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had dark parts, no doubt about it. But why on behalf of Rai he describes it like that? All its positive aspects were removed from the scenario, leaving nothing but a portrait very similar to the propaganda of a man who had the greatest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes, he threw Germany in the devastating second world war. Yes, he was racist, and yes, he was sometimes unstable instable, especially at the end of the war. Everything is true. But again; why the fuck did the LIE say to the public? To warn us? I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was that they were able to rise to power in moments of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil has been so recognized that it has been embraced by almost all the living Germans (not to mention the Austrians and a lot of other people) makes it a warning for modern civilization, not that Hitler was such a of "strange". If it had been as our creators did - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like the one in the film would never have come close to the party leader - not to mention the ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
