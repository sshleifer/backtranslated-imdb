This was far and away the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not frightening, not funny, not dramatic, not funny. Sarah Michelle Gellar rises to her old book of empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her character and no one else in the picture. For those who thought Grudge was "kind of good," then you're not going to see this unless you enjoy your time and your life. I saw this movie for free, so I do not want this to come as a guy from a guy who lost $ 8 on a terrible movie. He was free, he was still sucked, I hated him. Avoid.
