I was so anxious to see this when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. A cry out of Dr. Seuss's capricious world. It was vulgar and disgusting, I do not think Dr. Seuss would have approved. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand that they had some subtle jokes of adults, but my children do not have to catch up yet. While Cat in Hat shouted vulgarity, they caught much more than I would have liked. Trying with Dr. Seuss I really bothered to see how this ageless classic was destroyed on the big screen. See what they do with Horton hears. I hope this makes Dr. Seuss right.
