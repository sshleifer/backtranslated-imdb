I saw this movie in my cinema class. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I entered it with an open mind and even a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the song was exciting. I never connected with this movie. The act was great, the cinema was interesting, but the story, or rather the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central theme related to the film. Was it a love story between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it West? But no. It's all about reversing movies, I recently saw "Brick" and I loved it, but the place where this movie was was just there. It was so weird, and if I had not been forced to sit in the whole movie, I'd be out. The writing was not terrible, but it was just everywhere. Until this movie ended, I just was terribly confused and wanted to end earlier. It was just something about this movie that does not resonate, I understand many offbeat movies like "Fight Club", but I did not care about the characters at all.
