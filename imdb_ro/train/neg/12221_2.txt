Except for the sound, none of the above is really critical to this kind of horror movie, truly true. Make your effects and the gore are very good and the lead actor was effective, lead actress, though attractive needs some coaching because she was particularly poor. The major issue with Frightworld is its length at 108 minutes half an hour too long to be effective as a slash movie, wise plot only about ten minutes of the first fifty are relevant. In places it is visible the hiring and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films of favor. However, when this is combined with poor sound, as is the case with most of the movie's big sections are hard to watch. This could certainly be fun if the uniginal "serial killer back from death" movie with a judicious and ruthless editing, in its current form plays as an unfinished cut.
