It's not the biggest movie I can remember Paul Naschy. Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst sword I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the contest was just as bad. This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget about horror - it's nothing. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just an adventure by Robin Hood against a bad baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be king. The main feature of the movie was to see Graciela Nilson, who made only four films in two years and regrettably lost the loss. Where did he go?
