With little expectation, the new opening movie (more than five minutes) of "Husbands" came as a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new material was a class A material, but it provided a solid foundation for what "could" have been an original original film. Unfortunately, it was put together in 1955 in a programming period of a shooting day. After the new film, Jules White decided to pioneer only commercial video sequences from "Brideless Mire" in this short, which makes for a transition a not-so-straight story, which Jules and Felix Adler tried to fix with a bit of (Moe & Larry, in this case), shooting at us. <br /> <br /> 3/10
