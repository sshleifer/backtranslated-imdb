This game was made by Sega. Being done by Sega, I did not expect much, but I did not expect this junk. For beginners, the angles of the camcorder work against you in this game. Motorcycle is your means of getting closer. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Whenever you come into something you sit there and do not move. Never ride a bicycle or wreck for it. The main character does not speak very much, although he has a voice that suits him. Graphics is horrible. Go through the trees on the bike. The room makes enemy struggle impossible. This game would not even deserve to rent.
