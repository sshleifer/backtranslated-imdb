With a cast of British brilliant actors and a pleasant photograph of the 50s of Great Britain, I was hoping and I was expecting to be more distracted by this film. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck to the wrong reasons - I could not believe how dreadful it was. I've probably watched thousands of old movies and I'm always ready to make allowances because they are products of their time, but that was hard to do. As others have noticed, a major problem is that they do not seem to know what they want: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or music. I was a little gobsmacked when Jeannie Carson suddenly entered the song about 15 minutes into! It's not credible at any level, either the story itself or the fact that Daisy never seems to have a lot of threats in it. Other aspects that have contradicted credibility include including Donald Sinden as a composer (composer for the name of God!), Having Diana Dors as a fianc√©e and not seeming to have the slightest interest in her (that is, Diana Dors Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in an office of the songwriter. Everything is foolish in the worst possible way. If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be from the beginning with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - after which everything went down in a great way.
