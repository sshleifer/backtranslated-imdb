I caught this bomb from a recent movie on a cable channel and I remembered how terribly I thought it was in 1980 when he was released for the first time. Many commentators there are not old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the fight between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel has had legions of fans eager to see an alleged "master" director put this supernatural story on multiple layers on the screen. "Salem's Lot" was already destroyed in the late 1970s as a mini-series television directed by Tobe Hooper (he was the fame of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and was badly manipulated, turning the big villain of the book into "a vampire without any real threat destroying the whole premise. Fans hope that a Kubrick stature director would succeed where Hooper would have failed. It did not happen. Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrible opening sequence, but after some accomplishments, it's all down. Jack Nicholson can only be Jack Nicholson. He's always crazy and did not bring anything to his role here. I do not care that many commentators here think he's all in this clinker, "Here's Johnny!" despite ... it's terrible in this movie. So are the others. The character of Scatman Crothers, Dick Halloran, was crucial to the plot, but Kubrick kills him in one of the weakest shock sequences he ever put on the film. I remember the audience from the theater that I have seen repeatedly beating in the last 45 minutes of this miserable movement, those who have remained ... many have gone. King's books never translate well on film, because so many narratives appear inside his characters and often metaphysical. Kubrick stripped the tension between the living and the dead in favor of the style, and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we do not really care what happens to whom. This movie still smells and why so many think it is a horror masterpiece is beyond me.
