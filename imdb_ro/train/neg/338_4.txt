Definitely, one of Eddie Murphy's minor films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystic child, dragons of three hundred years and a "chosen". Murphy is the "chosen" in question, and the opening song suggests he is "the best man in the world." A discoverer of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is "the one chosen" and that it is his destiny to find and save the "Golden Child." For if the child die, compassion would die with him, for he is the compassionate bearer. If all these hocus pocus rubbish did not ruin it for you now, the movie starts. Suffice it to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the whole movie. It means to be another vehicle of Murphy's selfish brand of humor (comedy does not think so much), the film is failing on several levels. Even Charles Dance as evil Sardo Numspa can not do too much for procedures. Very bad and disappointing. Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
