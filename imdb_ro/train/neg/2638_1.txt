It's good. They were. And then they are The Sentinel, a bottom-barrel political thriller that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plan of a moth of secret service is a good one, but it has never been filmed with so much potential so completely dirty. Directed by Clark Johnson with "scum", every actor in this movie seems to be working on the automatic pilot. Even the great Michael Douglas seems bored here. I can honestly say that NEVER, in all my life, I have not seen another movie with so many fantastic holes of plot. The twist is predictable from the fourth, and the character's motives are so ridiculous that they inspired public laughter. Avoid this at any cost. This is a catastrophe of a movie without redeeming value.
