It's hard to find any positive in this movie. It looks like the producer would have had to make a dollar without too much effort and that's why we're drawn to a full Galaxy presentation, which is the slightest excuse for a film in history. Police girls seemed extremely sexy in their small uniforms. More action photos of the two police officers and much less of the Galaxy would have been the way forward. Of course this would add to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with the miserable resumption. Mrs. Albright makes an excellent sexy and she acts first. Mrs. Stabs, which I heard about, but which was not seen on the screen before, also looked very desirable but does not seem to have the basic acting talent. Besides Mrs. Albright, this is a real garbage.
