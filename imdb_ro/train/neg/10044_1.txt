This is the biggest flop in 2008. I do not know what the director has is his mind to create such a big disaster. The songs have been added without a story, the story has been stretched to fill the gap of 3 hours, and the most disgusting are the moments of action performed by actors as if everyone has superpowers that can run between bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and a person fighting 100 people. Only the best performance was that of Anil Kapoor, that he is always at the best role he plays as a negative character with a comic act speaking Hinglish ... Akki is also done a good job ... But the filmmaker just forgets it.
