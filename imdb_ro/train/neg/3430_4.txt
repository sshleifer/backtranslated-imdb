A bloody maniac, with cannibalistic tendencies, is violating a woman. He was shot by two policemen and then rose from the grave because of a satanic ritual ceremony made of a bad heresy. Female hunt continues with this zombie demon. The slaughtered child returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again, but only with the help of the police this will happen ... A 65-minute bloody mess ... Zombies horny, baby doll-babe , S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, heretical oppressors seeking refuge in front of Jesus Christ, and three screens at the end of the film, which explains what happened to the survivor in the end (yes, we should know! ) ... Two decent decent kicks can not save the situation. I've seen the worst horror movies, but that was pretty bad too. Recommended only for very-strong-sex fans of the genre.
