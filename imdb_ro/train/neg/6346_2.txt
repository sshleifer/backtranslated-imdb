This movie smells! You will again want the two extra hours needed to go through it. Sliding Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit did what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do much more. The film was intelligent, full of witchcraft and was well done. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather to the characters they played - and the performance provided by the support was fantastic. Where Melinda and Melinda are tiring, the dialogue was invented and I could have cared less about any of these people - at least about Melinda. A melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 am - and so melodramatic she is ridiculous, not comic. Melinda second is good but forgetful. Woody Allen's previous films have worked because, I suppose, he spent time with the script, and the actors were talented. A trivia piece for this movie is that it wrote this script in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not, not enough to be a full presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies, but you can not remember which of them. Sad, very sad.
