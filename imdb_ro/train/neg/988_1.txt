This film offers nothing to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. The actress is a horrible horrible, boring, long wind. Obviously, the length of the final sexual scene was trying to be shocking, but it just got a lot of a parody of what the movie was intended for. Complete rubbish, I can not believe what was a moving film. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure Rosario Dawson got into this movie because she would have been really despised by her heart, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will stick to this film because the movie behaves like an uninteresting episode of the OC or something that targets adolescents. Pathetic.
