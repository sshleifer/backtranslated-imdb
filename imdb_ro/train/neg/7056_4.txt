This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go wrong wrong. I expected at least something in this movie after I saw the add-on, which was fun to hell, but the movie was not as good. The strange part is that the jokes are actually funny, the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I do not know who to blame on this movie flop. The first candidates can be: - 1) hammers (actors) and hammerres (actresses) and not even funny 2) Director 3) The guy who distributes actors and / or director Whatever you are really bored and really want to say this movie or someone else get a copy of each ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your ass, because they will be more fun than the movie. ps the only rescuer to rescue this movie is mahesh manjrekar and fun chappu bhai
