Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the movie we found the worst in history. It was replaced by this "blockbuster" in Asia. He has a "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He came out of shape to be the kidnapper, the magical kidnapper flying here. The rest of these people could not get out of high school. The clich√©s were not scattered in dialogue, and the special effects were called as often as possible. It's easy enough to see that someone in Asia has a few dollars and had to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at. Or maybe he was a director or a writer who needed a credit. I think any career with this movie in her accreditations is an important favor and you're not looking at this movie. One hundred Thanksgiving Day could not consume this turkey. The funny scene was unintentional. King's brother appears on stage. The King? A beautiful, older, shorter actor in Asia. (Actor bad.) Brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) There was no apology for this. We expected not to notice that Jet Li's brother of this poor was a Pierce Brosnan in a cheap wig, "Injun," from an old Western film in the forties.
