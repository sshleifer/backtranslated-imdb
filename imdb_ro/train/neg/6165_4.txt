Allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates to go to real life) and has a weekend with his friends - who are the average, middle-class middle-class successes that appear in many of his films. I usually find something amused in Woody Allen's comedy, but here, indeed, I fall completely on my face. Even those with gaskets seem to have left it. Indeed, there is no plot (piece pieces of Shakespeare code) - but Allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air that even makes things worse and less ripe. <br /> <br /> It just does not work at any level and it's just a big hole. The best thing about this movie (besides the end of the credits comes) is that bad reviews seem to make it wake up and realize that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your colleagues in it does not make for entertainment .
