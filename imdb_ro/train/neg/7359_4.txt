Anyone who watched a few movies from cinematic life knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing he wipes off the planning table. So when Lara goes crazy in Patti's house and starts methodically getting his candy, I do not even blink. When Lara finally confronts her activities, threatening the poor Patti and dare to do something, I nodded. You see, on Planet LMN, people do not behave the way they do for any particular reason, but just do it to keep the action. Only on the planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a house thrown from their own house through their seductive powers! Patti wears - but she trusts too much and Lara took her medicine, and then it was a big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly things that end up in someone's belly and a body bag out the door girl. Horror! But take it from me, this LMN Planet product is a classic. You have to watch it once, just for the big laughter that you will have. On the Scale of Improbability, I give this film 95/100. Make lots of popcorn and get some slices of apples. You will understand later.
