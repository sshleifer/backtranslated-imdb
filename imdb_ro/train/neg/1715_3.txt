Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not exactly the truth. They took many liberties in reorganizing events, excluding people and using sets that did not fit the facts of their life in the 1930s. They were more than Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in band at different times, and those people had so much to do with the facts as those included. Buck and Blanche went to persuade Clyde to go straight ahead than a shotgun and was actually back in the murder. Some of the events that were presented in the light of the day actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much worse and justice has never been cured. It was so bad that she had to be carried by someone until she was healed and even then she stifled her so she went rigid. Clyde also went with a limp because while in prison he cut a big finger. I know, I'm a type of scene and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual errors in this "TRUE" story, the movie moves too fast from one event to another and it's more like several separate snapshots of their life, rather than being a coherent story flowing. I would recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get close to the truth.
