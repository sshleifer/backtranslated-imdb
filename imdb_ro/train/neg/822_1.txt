There are really two sections of this movie. First of all, there is the ridiculous prologue of the movie, which is so hysterical and horn that it should feel as fit as "The Simpsons" Troy McClure to make the narrative. Then the rest of the movie begins (starting with a title song that really does not fit into the rest of the movie, which, although technically OK, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot, and not only by uninteresting characters, but that does not make sense. <br /> This is especially true with Mickey Rooney's Spivent, who is supposed to have entered the plot and part of the "organization" all the time it would have happened if Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take his break away? In that case, he would have been a totally useless and useless person, who ultimately is still in. The general problem with the film is that he is not totally willing to give details about who or what is behind this conspiracy. It's as if scriptwriters would not have the courage to suggest that a certain section of society would be able to create such an organization and instead set themselves up in the hope that a lack of explanation would be enough for the public to form their own conclusions. br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie fails at all levels.
