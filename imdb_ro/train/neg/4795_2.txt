It seems that this is the only film John Saxon has ever directed and that he had the common sense to stop afterwards and stay in front of the room. This movie is a dog from the beginning to the end, and it is boring and woody, with nothing happening for that. A Vietnam War hero takes a job for a mob boss, gets a little friendly with his wife, and then his wife is killed by the mob boss and the hero of war framed and sent to prison. Now that special jail has experienced detained and test a formula that will turn people into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then all these infected people are trapped in prison, some of them turn into zombies, and the rest suddenly do not want to be there anymore. This goes on and on, and has nothing much to show or to say by itself, and I stopped until the end, which seemed to happen several times, but no, it seems he was just preparing to take off as different and as boring. If someone followed up to the end, it could become a zombie in itself, so do not risk it. 2 out of 10.
