Exploitation quite interesting in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress, Stacey Walker, is well-prepared and strangely attracted. It looks like a disturbed Renee Zellweger with a bad hair. This chicken made only two of these films and then moved back to Texas. Music is terrible. One of her friends is played by Sam Melville (from TV THE ROOKIES) using a different name. <br /> <br /> The best line in the movie from Tony - "You put me on, baby doll puts me on". Good cinema B / W from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locations (cool pool, also used in DEFILER). End strange, but appropriate. A 4 out of 10. Best Stacey Walker Performance.
