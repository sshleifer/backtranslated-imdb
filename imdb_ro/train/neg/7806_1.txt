Poor Michael Madsen; he must strike to know that people have learned about this horrible movie. I really can not think of anything worse I've ever seen, except for amateur porn. It's so bad, and everyone here; wood action, bad scenario, morally ending, do not hate it and it's in this movie. My question is, "Who the hell put $ $ in this piece of dog doo? Could have seen Michael Virginia's sister nude in a scene, but I do not think that would save that stinker ... For a great guy who has made some exceptional movies, I want to know how strange the church sponsored this piece of crap.
