This could be one of the worst movies ever made in production ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most interesting part is the beginning, where the guy goes ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). There are about 15 minutes walking distance. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention, there are a lot of problems with lighting and it's almost as if they shot night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The act was TERRIBLE. They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took those who came back. Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, you apologize. The Director should be prosecuted through the war crimes tribunal to prevent this from happening to the public.
