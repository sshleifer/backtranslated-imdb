I found the film offensive for Americans who lost someone in the towers, for the American people in general. Pretending to have been a tribute to the terrible deeds that have happened in recent years, each director uses the opportunity to polemize with old deeds (which do not have to do with a terrorist attack) or to criticize the American political behavior or compare the situation a different country, a country that has nothing to do or share with September 11th atrocity. Shame on them.
