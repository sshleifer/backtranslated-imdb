I thought I saw this movie twice in fact. Then I read all the other reviews and did not fit. One man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study the alleged bigfoot observations. I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie we've seen, despite discrepancies in reviews. Therefore, I like to see: if you like the occasional "B" movie, as I do, then return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding to your favorite movie bomb or just hanging out with your friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button and have a fun night of improvisation. Careful! Is Legend True? I think we could just find out, along with a not so stellar cast. Will there be failures at certain key moments of the movie? Our blond hero, man, young man has his hair in his chest? The exceptionally high tech color will last the whole movie? You will have to look to find yourself.
