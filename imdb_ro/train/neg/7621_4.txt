As noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently being "You've got mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Ryan Pout" Ryan. Of most versions, this is my least favorite. The problem is that the studio has played in the charisma of the stars, which does not cut it here. The chemistry between the two leaders never gets boiled in this movie. There is no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remember one day, nice, but gentle donuts. And when the leaders are boring, the rest of the film can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. Looks like he has no neck! I do not know if she has trouble with pain or something, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head in her coat, all bent and everything. I did not realize what Van Johnson was. I would have made a bee line for that cute cello. And Van was not big. I've always thought of him as a leading Hollywood man and doing nothing to scatter that picture here. If you are a fan of the stars or in the early 1900s then you might want this movie. But there are more romantic comedies out there and they offer you much more than just an old piece of clothing.
