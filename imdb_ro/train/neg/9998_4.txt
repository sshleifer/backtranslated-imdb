By the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like in a classroom watching the way our navy sailed at sea. I enjoyed seeing the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have figured it out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 transport to transport valuable old paintings with very low security is odd and not realistic. The act was pretty good because they are more professional, but if you stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more a fantasy, a story, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, night clock and Dracula, also on board. The film was full of familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood must exaggerate a little for drama, but hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is turned into a cartoon. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet with movies about air travel is that everyone just moves in the usual way. They take a drink, take them down and take them 5 minutes later, as if they are in a building or something, and act like the turbulence does not exist. I also know it's a disastrous movie, but the suspense should not include an accident of 30 seconds after it hit something. However, savvy actors and actresses keep this poor scenario from being transformed into a movie that was preserved after the first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see a psychotic person be wrapped ... :)
