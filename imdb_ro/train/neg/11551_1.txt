Seriously, absolutely nothing is not good about this fest. Randolph Scott, a cabinetmaker who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is the least in his most boring and boring role. At age 57, he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, though it does not matter so much because Gail Russell looks so much better than the 31-year-old and is so ugly because of his chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual role, but it is not enough to save this garbage. Thank God they do not make westerns anymore, they're just dated, old racist movies that enchant weapons and killing. 0/10.
