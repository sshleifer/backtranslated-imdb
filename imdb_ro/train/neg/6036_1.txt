With an unfamiliar melody that seems to stay that way, this "movie" is still a cheap shot that amazes me how it was released. I have no problem with horrors and slasher blows in particular, in fact, they are my favorites. But when finished, HERE BAD, really takes the monkey and no wonder the genre has such a hard time. The story is cliché and unimaginative, with a bunch of people in a cabin in the forest is cut and hacked this zombie / ghost. It is not the most suicidal story, his acting actor and diamonds, the quality of a director at home and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and some incredible footage of leneşti - Moroni these are outside in natural light and still have to believe that it night? What the hell was the director thinking of this movement? What, had only one day to shoot all this? Was he scared of the dark? (It's hilarious to see a cop to walk the pure light of a torch acting as would be pitch black, though) I think the positive actors is that shows that people who work in the local supermarket so at least they would could escape from this film without ever noticing. I'm sure one of the "teens" play bingo local pub - but is 40-45 years. Anyway, good for a laugh, but just another waste of film and time.
