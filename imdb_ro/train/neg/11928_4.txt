The life of the saints begins with an atmospheric vision of London, like a crowded, strange, brilliant street city. We hoped he would keep this atmosphere, but he is stuck in a story that does not work at all. Othello works for big, fat, Mr. Karva, his murderer's little father thinks he's what he should be, because he never really defined, but he's dropping cats in Fries in fat, so trust me, he's an imbecile) Small Scrappy fees while his girlfriend skanky gives him his hand job daddy. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always goes from A to B. Until the day he meets an almost homeless child who gives him the desire to be able to stop running. Runner finds the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he starts prompting more wishes. Obtained to fulfill some desires, Karva kidnaps the boy. But he is not sure what happiness would bring him. Is it innocent to be a child again or is it another hand? Anyway, I do not want to see the little boy he gives to the second guy. It only takes ages to go and there are plenty of repetitive scenes. The end is trying to be shocking, but since it's not a back-story investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grison, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, trying to interfere in a kind of religious allegory that ends up being picky as all hell, ironically. If he had given us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for strange characters at once, then it would have been a more enjoyable movie. As it is, we are introduced into a bunch of annoying loudmouths that then seem to develop miraculously of information when confronting the mysterious boy. Who is never revealed? That's just irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from the sporadic moments of the atmosphere and a capricious score, this film has little to recommend.
