I only give 3 stars for beautiful photos of Africa. The rest was ... pretty boring. For about 50 minutes we have the sketch of the plot ... In the World War, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? Then it was a real action! This is something like: "Let's take a walk in the savanna and look at beautiful sunsets!". And he can send a message, such as "Do not kill elephants!". Very environmentally friendly. I would have expected this from a "new" movie by Steven Segal, not from this ... The main actress makes me think about the artificial bronze, the dyed hair and the big foundation! And I have not seen a scene where her hair is tangled, or sweating or clothes are dust. She does not look like a 19th-century woman! And in the bar, where he's looking for our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 and became famous in the years to come. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa between 1840 and 1880. So if the action does not take place between 1896 and 1900. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a beautiful impression .. like a nut shell - loud outward, but soft and cuddly inside. Not that I'm crazy with a nut, but you got the point. He really manages to show his dog on his face several times. The film broke down. How long and more and more boring. do not watch him! Do not buy it! It's a waste of money!
