POPEYE and big leg **; POPEYE MOTOR COMPANY **; GETTING GOAT by POPEYE ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used to embrace them as a child, but capturing an episode of the series of three cartoons in the back, that is, many years later (preceded testing THEATER OF THE SEVEN SEASES [1953]), I see how it does not keep everything well! The character of Popeye is not too sympathetic to start with, Olive Oyl distinctly upset and Bluto's antics have failed to get too much interest either? in short, the scriptures were alarmingly thin, terrible, and generally unwavering to charge. There are strictly minors, but I doubt that today's children would have the patience to stay with them! In addition, the animation style is unattractive. Taking each short in itself, I think they have improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as it was, so the third cartoon easily leads to being the most pleasing of the batches ? Popeye is entrusted by a mascot army goat whose immense appetite does not cause him any end of mistake (hardly original, I know, but always a funny game). An interesting element in this case was that the shorts were accompanied by Popeye, giving them moral pieces of wisdom to children in the audience.
