At first we begin to see the beginning of a secret council of some kind. Everything looks very promising since leaving. With some supernatural elements thrown, the mystery becomes more interesting in the minute. The main character who seems to be a good bloke is in trouble because of his demand for money he has the right (temptation) and other factors. You really are empathetic to the guy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Normally, a person in his situation would have more options. Somehow he does not have these options. In this film, it seems to be one solution, even if it is clear that it is not his fault. From blue she meets characters who talk about the church, prayer and God. And he gives the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at some point in the film what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Because it is always helpful. But it was really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element has destroyed the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, simplicity can not escape the fact that more must be done in real life to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery presented to us is never solved. Instead, you have to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. The brilliant former actor is appropriate, but if you follow closely, you will see that he is not at all serious. He really has to be desperate for money. Otherwise, what would have an actor of his caliber to act on a movie like this.
