I hired this movie yesterday, especially because of the fine art and the summary on the back of the jacket. After I removed it to the DVD player, I reviewed the jacket cover and even if I removed it from the visual display, I was unable to read any details about the film production. This movie is titled Evil on Jacket and had to locate it by visiting the Faith Films site to find out any link to it here on IMDb. The filming and special affections made in the film seemed pretty good ... Then a line-reading actor spoke. Oh, honey ... this actor's lecture sounded like a junior high school jock whose voice had just managed to change the ground and did not try to overcome the script languages. At first I thought I got a bad disk from audio sync, then I had to assume it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket ... the English dialogue was called. If he had the right person to double the dialogue, this movie could have been decent. I gave her a chance about 20 minutes before I took it out, when I discovered that the bad-reader would not be killed, but it would remain the main element. Yeah, that's bad! The jacket covers the art and art made in the movie are great, so it gave a star but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I do not recommend it!
