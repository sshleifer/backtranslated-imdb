They should have named this movie: "Adopted Mouse Brother who is less inspired by Stuart Little's vague memory, which has just reduced the book a bit, but especially just the cover" If it had not been so misleading , I would give it a better review. But the people seriously, make your children a favor and read their book. They might learn something, instead of humming their minds through what we all know as a Hollywood movie. Stuart's little book is not about a mouse, but about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He was born to his parents, he was not adopted. The book refers to his life and eventual departure from home and on the journey he engages. There's a cat called Snowball who thinks it's food and wants to eat it, but Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> In the movie they have cheated all this. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat and name race.
