This is far worse than those of Laurel and Hardy's cartoons in the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripples of the rebirth of Stan and Ollie. New people rediscovered the pairs' comedy genius, and cartoons were the mental garbage that took care to capture the interest of the children. It was expected. But how does it even try to rationalize this work of ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the producers hope to inspire some other revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you can not inspire your interest in the past with a superficial and unfortunate caricature of what made the original so appealing. Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) make a Vegas act and from here they belong. The plot is even more slim than the ones used in the past, trying to stretch the ideas with two drums for a feature. If this movie was the first exposure of someone to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer will give up the reputation of the original duo that senility has disappeared. The only movie I hate worse than this is that I SPITTEN ON THE RIGHT. And, you know, these composers did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
