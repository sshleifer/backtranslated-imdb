This movie is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be a snow crash. It starts with a seemingly evil girl, killing a bunch of nuns on a mission. As it turns out, the people in him were possessed of random zombies. Well, a few years later, some colleagues are joking. Horror works from pledge to jockey. Things like the jock shouting at him to do things in a rather non-chronotic way, with the commitment to react and to make everywhere "eager to be the popular role" What really took cake with it is the final battle. Special HORRIBLE Special Effects with Weapons. For example, guns give a flash without a flash, and vice versa. this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why move in motion stop is a mystery), cheesy music, and about 40 weapons coming from nowhere. Generally, this movie is carp. Like just a few others, you can rent 50 cents at the closest movie rental spot behind the forehead.
