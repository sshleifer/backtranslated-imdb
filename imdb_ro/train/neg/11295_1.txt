I understand that this film is for children and as a parent I have been in many films that do not particularly interest my interest, but I can constructively appreciate the way my children receive it. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and monitor the quality of the entertainment they see, so there should be something to appeal to an adult audience at a certain level even in children's videos. Disney has always understood this, and so it is so hard to understand how such a complete piece of drek could allow its name. Technically, sound editing is horrible and all dialogs call over-and-unnatural. Personally, I do not like this, but it was double frightening as the dialogue itself seemed to have been written by a 12-year school project. "The Actor" reminded me of a school play and none of the child's actors had any excitement in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. Now, before coming as a video-geek that measures a children's movie with an adult backyard, the only thing that can save even the worst movie for kids is a positive message. Far from me to determine how a message should be transmitted as long as it is correct. Let's take a stroll through this movie to see what messages are given: <br /> <br /> If you are lost, do not worry, you will inevitably find your way home. Approaching wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you know you can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, the last message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's good not to listen to the figures of the authorities and do what you think is right.
