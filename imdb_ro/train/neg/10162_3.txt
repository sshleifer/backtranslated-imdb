This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "Just how the people in Ohio Valley are!" I'm out of the area and I have experienced the movie as "Just the way people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there at minimum wages. We laughed a lot, we tied and paused with people of our age; the young men went out together at night. Older people had little time left after work because they were dealing with their families. The area is beautiful during the summer and there is no rain in the winter rain anywhere else. Apart from the fact that "if you live in a manufactured house you have to be depressed," the story contained no element of charm, mystery or even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the worst cartoon. It is doubtful that someone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if he had, he would probably have made friends there. I read reviews that seem to suppose Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and thinner," but if that is the case, it is not shown. All we see is that Martha learns not to like Rose for reasons that would apply equally if the three friends were of the same age and sex. We see that Martha feels deserted during smoking sessions, out of the loop when making social plans, used, but not appreciated and eventually disrespected and injured. Just one thing: Should we suspect Kyle of murder because he once had some panic attacks? Please. This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.
