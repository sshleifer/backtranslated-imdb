My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because I saw Nana Visitor's name on the box. This movie is a travesty I hope she dares from her resume. "Complot" was lost and flapping, acting was largely dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie made no sense. The raw plan of a species of foreign parasites that infects humans has often been made by movies with much better scripts than this, for example, the invasion of snatchers and the faculty. the bad luck to come across this film, I suggest you burn it. How to categorize yourself as a horror film when there is no use of fear, suspense, gore, terror or any other horror movie that you do not know, however, if you still find that you want to watch this movie , I suggest you have a large amount of sugar in front of your hand so you can find funny parts.
