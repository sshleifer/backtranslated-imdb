The social comment was exaggerated, and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences, which were entirely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life over the last decade, which makes it interesting from a distance. <br /> <br /> I even had problems understanding why she complained about her stay in Australia compared to the opportunities to solve the mysteries she has in England. Can not he insist on Australian police? It sounds like a very artificial sampling point to make them involved in a crime investigation. The last episodes of the original series were quite melodramatic and implausible, sometimes surrounded by imbecile, and this raises that mantle rather than returning to the center of the first series. Sad.
