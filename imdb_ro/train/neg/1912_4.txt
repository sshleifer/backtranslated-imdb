There is nothing new here. All standard scenes of romantic comedy, even up to taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the flying woman. The only thing he saves is the act of Alison Eastwood and some of the minor characters (blink and you will lose Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had fun. fortunately, and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain of the plot.
