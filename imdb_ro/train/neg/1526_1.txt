You may have seen worse movies than that, but if I had, I do not remember. Or possibly blocked them. Who knows, if I had hypnotherapy, I could remember them, maybe, kidnapped by strangers like a child or other traumas. If so, I would happily exchange those memories for what I have to watch this movie. I should give the film a credit: it produced an emotional response. Actually, I started to get angry at scenes that falsified other movies and TV programs, that this travesty messed up with them. I'm frightened that I can not see movies like Dr Strangelove again without this film going over my mind.
