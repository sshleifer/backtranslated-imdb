Anyone who watched Comedy Central around midnight in recent years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw the ads for this movie in 2001. It looks like it could be fun, but I was not about to call the number on the TV screen and order it without seeing the first movie. I thought I was waiting until the movie was available for rent at Blockbuster. About a year and a half later, I was at Tower Records and in the "DVDS for less than $ 20" pile, there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD was only $ 6.99 I decided to buy it. I went home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for laughter ... and I waited a little longer. The laughter never came. I should have liked to agree with almost any other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Ill, desperately tasteless, and badly written and directed, UNDERGROUND COMEDY is an atrocious piece of garbage and, in my opinion, is the worst film of all time. They're not stars.
