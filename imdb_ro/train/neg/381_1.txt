This film is the traditional Bollywood fare to star power, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this film was the absurd notion of the surrogate mother manufacturer. A whore who conceives a child with someone after having sex with the man (the family who wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. Nor is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have seen movies and television shows in India, who have done 10-15 years ago, who have touched this issue smarter. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely unpalatable. I realize that most Bollywood movies are not meant to be plausible, but they are not even supposed to be. This movie wants to emulate with the characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous and controversial conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
