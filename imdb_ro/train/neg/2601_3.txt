I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch her as I like Drew Barrymore and I want to see one of her early movies. The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA to overcome her recently troubled loss. Shortly after he moved to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious he has a bad twin that haunts her. The film is pretty poor and bad. Both the dialogues and the act make the movie worthless to see. Summing up is something for Drew Barrymore's fans.
