I ordered this extremely rare and extremely overrated film on ebay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As an eternal fan of the horror, from Americans from the 1980s to the European zombie films, I said that would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. First of all, I thought it would be more dizzy than it really is. After all I heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to look at him. The murders are boring. The actor ... forgets it, stop acting! The story, even if we do not care, is incredibly bad. They seem to have tried to draw your attention to strange sex scenes and naked girls, but unfortunately in this case it does not help the movie. Why? There is no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this movie. It's just a bad movie from point A to B. Although it is extremely fun and fun to look at friends and a lot of beers, do not make any effort to get your hands on it. There are so many movies in this world, do not waste your time watching the Necro files!
