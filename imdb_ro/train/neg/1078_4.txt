The divorce lawyer, Rick Magruder (Branagh), is hindered by an evening-hosted party and has a chance to meet a woman named Mallory Doss (Davidtz) who was a waitress at the party and seems to lost his car. Rick leads the woman home and there discovers that her car has already been parked there, apparently by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall). Rick and Mallory go into the house arguing that Mallory is undressing in front of Rick and then spends the night with her. Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory meets him later in the day, asking him to file a complaint against her father because of his dangerous behavior. Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, manages to put Dixon in court and sent to prison, but when released by his local friends, Rick is in trouble trying to protect himself and on him the children of the danger he brought to life without knowing.
