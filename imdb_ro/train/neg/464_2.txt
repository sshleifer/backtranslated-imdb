This movie is not funny anyway, trying to be fun with blade humor, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the movie, I was thinking of one thing: "When this is over." One thing you have to give them is that they have very few funny moments, so I gave them a whole 2 stars. She is non-original and uses almost any old blonde joke in the book, even those that were not funny for the first time. Basically, it's a movie to blonde blonde and record the whole blonde joke. To summarize everything, this movie is blonde humor filled bad, it is not worth paying no amount of money to watch, it is really so bad.
