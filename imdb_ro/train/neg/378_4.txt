... but the keyword here is "usually". I was known to adore films. But in the world of rated B movies, it's rated Z. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect for most of my favorite B movies is that they are not taking too seriously. Producers of such films easily treat the film, even if it is a difficult subject. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film took it seriously, as if they were putting together a classic 10-star classic full of poor attempts at poisoning lines and great camera shots. Nonetheless, despite all these things, I've given 4 out of 10 stars as they are biased towards such films. If you are a B rated fan, however, I would try too much to find this.
