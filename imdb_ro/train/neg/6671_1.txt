I felt that this movie started well. The act was on the scene and I felt for all the characters, even if the true family unit was not fully disclosed. I never had enough information about my father to really feel the pain for his whole involvement or to build his animosity with the drums. I mean in one scene you see him admiring him for tension and another scene he's just on his head. Another problem with the movie was that it dug up and lost all the attention to the end and I asked to end this. Any movie with such a long draw and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or more than to act. We look at all the qualities of the film experience. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that we have seriously considered leaving the theater. This movie fired me then just spit on me.
