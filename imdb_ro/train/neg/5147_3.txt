"The Blue Desert" might have had the potential to be a plausible and enjoyable thriller, the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox), was not that stupid. When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, comic artist Roberts moves into a small Western city. In her early days, she meets Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this part well) the crazy suspense that will never leave. Fearing for her safety, having been in the situation twice before, she made a friendship and relationship with City Police, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, the character that does not seem quite convincing, leaving the audience confident, convinced of red herring thrown by writers). Smith needs Roberts' co-operation because, as he says, Atkins is an ex-con, and guilty of sexual assault. But the cops had no evidence to put it before. The film had plenty of walks to make at least one interesting film, because quite soon, there is such confusion as to who Roberts should trust. However, much of the intentional suspense seems too forceful, as Roberts's character does not seem to react to simple things, as we think it could be any reasonable person. And its delayed answers allow a lot of suspense to happen easily and unconvincingly, especially in the end. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too, the child he faces in sorts of remembrance of Kevin Anderson's character, obviously in his character, in "Sleeping with the enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, that would be enough. Meanwhile, the movie is not that great, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
