When someone from Kino Video gathered his fine collection of movies "Slapstick Enciclopedia", a selection of several silent comedy boxes, someone decided to release the first installment of "ONE MOO" (1916), a dark, far-off young Oliver Hardy. As pleasant as the set is everywhere, this decision was unfortunate, because one very much is a very poor film, which almost discourages the viewer from looking further. Like any typical farce, it involves cheating inspired by greed, panic when plans go in order and complications that grow to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good one, MUST be incoherent, dysfunctional and even disturbing. It is hard to tell at this time whether the hopeless plot is the result of the lack of film or uneven filming, but whatever the cause, up to the middle of the road, even the most attentive spectator has no idea what character relationships are or what happens, and at the end of the year does not care. The only point of interest here is to see 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who seems considerably harder than Stan Laurel's later a decade, but still full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, waking up with a hangover, Babe performs a backsliding back from a bed. Believe me, it's as fun as this movie. If you read this before seeing Kino's first movie "Slapstick Enciclopedia" I suggest you move ahead quickly and move on to the good things.
