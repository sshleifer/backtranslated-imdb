I think the biggest disappointment of this film was that, to the end, I expected the casting instructors to interrupt and apologize for how poor the act was. When you consider the subject strong, the brilliant landscape and the effort made to create a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that too much attention has been paid to the drive. <br /> <br />
