This documentary begins with an interesting concern - it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus, as is usually believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after having helped us, the film completely changes gear and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity and focusing on the targets that are easy to accomplish. The writer / director has some problems with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this film seems to be his release form. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes, but overall, the film is disappointing.
