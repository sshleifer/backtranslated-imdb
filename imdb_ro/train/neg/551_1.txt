I went through the list of the best 100 comedies of AFI and I have to say that it is really one of the worst. Not just the 90 movies on the list we've seen, but any movie I've ever seen. The drunkards are fun sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza almost deserved, but unfortunately ... go and look at Arrested Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks should be funny? I would highly recommend almost any other movie about AFI's 100 best comedies for more laugh than that. If you want to see a funny "drunk", try The Thin Man. The Funnier movie, in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Arthur).
