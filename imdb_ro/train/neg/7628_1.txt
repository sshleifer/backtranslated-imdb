Black and white film. Good picture. Credible characters. <br /> <br /> Only awful. I was wasting another perfect evening watching a movie that other people considered "dignified" and "very good". There is good action here and the back setting of the ground is good (more should be done) but it is very slow to grow and never grow. It is based entirely on sex, without too much love, with much needed nudity. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to watch with you family this does not in the movie and if you will not have trouble sitting through it. Although this film is long, its depth is only 1 cm!
