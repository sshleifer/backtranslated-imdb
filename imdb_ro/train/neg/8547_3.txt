This was a pretty creepy movie; I found music to be effective for that. The photos Mario took from the village were also disturbing. However, I had three problems with this movie. One is that the enlightenment was very dark, so it was hard to tell from time to time what was happening, but that could have been my copy. The second is that the beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what's going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the end, but it seems some people are doing it. Of course, there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and male leadership is very old for 70 years. All in all, observable, but not nearly to be a favorite.
