Class is a series of comedies featuring a bunch of former classmates of 27 years. I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why I'm sorry that the Class is not fun, even if it has the obvious potential. There is not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to slow pace and lack of punch lines. Also, some actors have difficulty synchronizing. Most characters written in writing are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem to be a bit too square for the good of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find the most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the couple used to be Duncan and Nicole. What bothers me with the series is that the only Latin character Aaron is being chosen for his accent (albeit by an inappropriate character, but anyway).
