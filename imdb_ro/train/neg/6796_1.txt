Linda Lovelace was the victim of a nasty sadic, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how to have sex with a dog (which is also the abuse of animals) can be fun or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I strongly feel that these types of movies fuel the hatred of fire and other misogynistic feelings about women. This society continues to describe women as sexual objects, unlike human beings. We call ourselves "civilized," but I feel we have much to go before we can ever scratch the civilized surface.
