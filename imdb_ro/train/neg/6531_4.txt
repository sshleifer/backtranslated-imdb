First of all, I would like to say that users' comments left me with tears in my eyes of laughter. A comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is even on the mark. MST3000 has made it so. If you look at the ROSU ANGRY PLANET as a fever dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader since 1959, you will have a hand on this sucker. All elements are present: pseudoscience, occasional logic, more often hilarious infantile. The adolescent boy's attitude towards sex, with captain "gigolo" (call him, boys!) Looking at the "scientist" with so red hair, he's surprised he does not trigger fire alarms. Mars's ridiculous concept of a planet so foreign that everything shines red, yet a foreign monster has a face of the mouse, and the alien blob has an eye that rotates like a toy for children. Reluctance of the comic, an overweight astronaut (!) That sounds like he never finished the eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fix on his ray of his ray. And, of course, the mere fact that the stranger is dangerously evil. If these people met E.T, he would have fried him in two seconds! "OW" really! Do not get me wrong. I rated this low movie. However, it is never boring (unless the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make everything greedy) and you have to admit that in your baby's small heart it makes you jump several times. <br /> <br /> Well, then you do not recognize it. I think you've never been 10 years old.
