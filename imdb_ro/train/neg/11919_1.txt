this must be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great to me. Since then I always wanted to see, but we could never find it ... ... until today, yes, 14 years later. Just let me say that I was so unrealistically disappointed, OK I knew it would not be an Oscar winner, but still hope it would be a non-brain film fun in blood mold. Unfortunately, it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> that's all rock rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was pretty scary. Battle scenes were garbage and look fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD cost me only £ 5 and I think I was overloaded with £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad I know I will never get that hour and a half back.
