Terrible, just terrible. My theory about "the power of the stars" proves to be true. This should be a great TV, because the guy who directed (Battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this schtick schtick schtick about a chicken. Find something thousands of times more exciting to do - like watching TV without picture and sound. 1/10 (we rated it so high b / c there are no negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system). <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> My theory of "star power" is: the more "star power" is used in a show, the less spectacle is. (It is called an indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" for better quality, etc. Another way to look is "more is less.") Z
