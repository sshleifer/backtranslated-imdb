A Christmas story is a classic holiday and my favorite movie. So naturally I was excited when this movie came out in 1994. I saw the opening day and I was ready to enjoy myself. I came a long way and I was revolted. Anticipation that is true in a Christmas story is uninterested in this misery. A red Ryder BB pistol is better than a Chinese top. And it's not very funny at all. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stops there. Bottom line: 1 star. It does not even bother me.
