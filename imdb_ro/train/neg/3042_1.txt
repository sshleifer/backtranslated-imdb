I'm allowed to write 1,000 words about this movie, but one word would be enough: bizarre. Hubby and I have laughed so much that I looked into the really terrible movie. We looked at each other with the best "What ...?" expressions. There is no way to properly describe this movie. The kilogram of tomatoes was funny, but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this strange and weird film and then packs it as if it were suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can look at her - perhaps with "What ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to impose this movie on others, you might want to spike their eggog. <br /> <br /> Enough of the worst movie ever made.
