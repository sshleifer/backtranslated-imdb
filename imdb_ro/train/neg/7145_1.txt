It seems that Hollywood offers only money to those who have a camera and the ability to speak. This movie was bad trouble mind. The casting was terrible, the untouchable act and the hoarse story. Script? who needs scripts? I was surprised that the film was not as vulgar as I thought it would be, but I still have enough T & A photography to take a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19-year-old cursor with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so badly written, I thought the two brothers of the movie were lovers at first. The scenes from the contest track, along with the main female actor in the film, made me think of Herbie: completely loaded. This is the kind of film Grindhouse modeled after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
