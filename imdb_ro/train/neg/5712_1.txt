After I stood in this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was that crazy and formal one. But American propaganda thrown in front of you throughout the film proves - disappointingly - that it is a work of people. Tell me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes, "We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it," they seem to be ways to justify actions such as Iraq's invasion, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage finds some lines like "use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip" with a straight face made me and my husband wonders if the whole castaway took Valium before photographing each scene. The "reason" behind each plot and a new "clue" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a misogyn bonus side plot with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-was condemned by all those involved for "not closing". It's clear in the film just for the look, but they felt the need to push a "dr" title on her character to give her a seriousness. At one point, Cage's character says, "Are you never shut up?" and the camera was looking at her, looking at her hands as if she were a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this movie was that it is so amazingly bad that you make some laughs of it. The really scary thing is that most people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....
