Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. Essentially, this is a mix of class B pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young man who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was killed and she was, at least in one case, the main suspect) or has only a very bad case of multiple personality disorder? George Newbern is his new roommate, and most actions focus on him. Newbern's character is quite sympathetic and both he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not very good). The mediocre writer at (sometimes) totally horrible and unimpressive direction seem to have combined to sink the rest of the oblivion performance. Leslie Hope's story is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget it. Eventually, the plot disintegrates into a bifurcation (a bow of a story is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) so badly conceived, acted and photographed to effectively counteract most of the value which the film had previously received. Overall, the movie has the feeling of what one might expect to be the result of the first M. Knight Shamalyan Bachelor's Film Course. The scenario and script for the two leaders are good enough to care a little about them - at least until the film unfolds completely and completely. My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a premium - meeting with people.
