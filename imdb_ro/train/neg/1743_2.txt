Unlike the title, this film does not offer any kind of spice and thus the audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forcefully, theatrically, mechanically, scenario, which reminds of Pakistani pieces available on video, including even manners. Everyone yells, yells and makes strange things for no reason. The premise seems interesting because it is a straight rise from "Boeing Boeing" in Hollywood. "John Abraham, which is so natural in almost all of his films, is a total wandering here, if we keep the moral factor apart, even then the bizarre events show up." Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced students are trying hard to raise the film by being natural, but in vain.At least, the three-person characters should be in contrast to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately here, (3Bs) who speak, behave and even scream in a pretty way The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls in the same house, pretending that they will never know each other - to do something Sex, what else? The same thing could be done in hundreds by other ways, so much dramabasis, without any reason, is not something that the public will digest easily, be an original film, now for those who call it situational comedy , I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such a cinema audience is certainly corrupt and demented, as they connect to a kind of sadistic, weird and maddening humor, where are not the characters they laugh at, but rather on themselves and on their own frustrations that show how insignificant we have become that, to laugh, we have to endure such things?
