If the scale was negative, I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was beautiful, and Nisha Kothari has a brilliant future, but the producer and the director have ruined any joy in this story. Choice of angles, choice of lighting and everything that was distracted from trying to remember the story. If the songs and the dances did not cause you to ruin your ears first. The movie could have been done twice at 1.25 pm and was pretty good, like "Seven Samurai," but the director and writer did not go that way, even if the "cities" finally find their backbone and they will to help. This film does not succeed on so many levels: editing, writing, shooting angles, style, illumination, scenario - the name of any aspect of this movie - was BAD - probably the food from the vendor was bad. I have never seen Indian movies (Bollywood) in 6 years that have seen something bad done.
