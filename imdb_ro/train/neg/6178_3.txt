"Frank Tashlin's Front" is one of Snafu's private pants, a series of cartoons made as training films for soldiers. Rather than take Snafu inappropriate actions that lead to disaster, the "Home Front" focuses instead on those close to home and how much they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays harder the risqu√© card, long jokes involving stripteases and little girls dancing instead of a comic strip. The result is a well defined short circuit, which today has little relevance or entertainment value, other than as a historical artifact.
