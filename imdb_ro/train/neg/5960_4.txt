My friends and I hired this for "Bad Movie Night" with great hopes, but the Brain was something bad. The brain itself is jealous, but it is mostly on its small platform. Who thought it would be great for the Brain to reach three people in 94 minutes? This film has a number of things for him at the beginning, including an Estevez-knockoff ruler who plays a rebellious genius (we are told that his enormous intellect is misdirected in his elaborate troubles and school stunts, which include putting Krazy on the chair someone). She also has some wonderful lines, a hilarious henchman out of shape and breath, who barely succeeds to be everywhere and, yes, some chickens become naked. However, the director desperately needs tuition in the art of stimulation. During the last half, things start to shoot and start with at least 3 or 4 unnecessary and dull scenes that make up the middle third of the pitch. The scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same ladder. I could have set the scene for this in half an hour - more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more brain activity. If you want to make a bad horror film, at least give me something bad to watch while my superhero stops. Maybe the director tried to bring the audience into his movie - I began to feel like one of the zombie dwellers by the end of this crapfest.
