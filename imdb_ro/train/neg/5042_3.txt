The main complaint with this movie is that I can not tell who is who. He does not intend any racism, but these Asians looked the same! I can say somewhat about the story, but that's about as far. The peoples' identities are not a mystery, if it were a mystery that I would care about. Instead, I was not on the screen as fast as I could. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide-ranging photos and emotionless faces take this film. Heck is boring, not only do not know these people, but they just sit there. Production is the typical Chinese John Woo, a horror movie with painted scenes. This looks just a little better than Andy Lau's "Full Killer" (which was a great movie.) You would think with a decent budget that it might at least look like the Hollywood of the 90's. I did not know the Chinese had these beatniki of art.
