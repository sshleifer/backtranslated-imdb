This is the only thing I can say positively about this movie. Cleveland is the star, I've been there, and I have not seen the city look so good. The beauty of the river and the cities. This movie moves forward at such a pace, hoping you will not notice the lack of relevance in the real world. People running and throwing weapons without any consequences. For example, there is a blow to Rob Lowe's house - two cars are stolen, and yet the cops do not appear until much later in the movie. The crime of hiring never seemed so implausible. Whoever wrote this movie should be at the end of the welcoming end of one of the countless movies of stray bullets. Many actors in this movie are much better than that. I checked the date of the movie just to make sure it was not written during the writers strike, but unfortunately it was not the case. This movie is currently in rotation on Universal's HD channel - if you do not want to sink over Lowe, there's no reason to watch it.
