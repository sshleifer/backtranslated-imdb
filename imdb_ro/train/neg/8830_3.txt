Just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and WORLD ALL a bizarre end close to Hollywood, which is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler, as you will not guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> YOu will also have to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct subtones. The conflict between white and black has been highly controversial and side-by-side. I did not understand why the author had the local black community that behaved in such an unacceptable manner that he / she is trying to be racist? A truly bizarre movie. Look only if you like to be very angry with the holes in the plot and want to discuss all the things that might or would not have been supposed to happen. But on the positive side, filming and acting is excellent.
