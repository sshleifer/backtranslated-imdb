I rated this movie a 1, because the intrigue is so incredibly unbelievable. Judge for you. Be warned, the next thing will not only reveal the plot, it will spoil your appetite for watching the movie. A computer virus, designed by a frustrated geek, sends code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - falls into the eye, it can access the "electrical system" of your body. What he does is to force the body's cells into calcium excretion. Within a few seconds after infection, the patient touches the throat, develops the view of the tunnel, turns the skin into white calcium, then falls and the hand and horn will break into a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very smart. When a blind computer expert tries to disassemble the code with a hand-held braille output device, the device is set to a very high voltage, causing severe burns on the expert's skin. The virus also feels aggression against ATM remote controls and keypads. Fortunately, it could be stopped by throwing over the desktop overcome by the desktop in a rack and electrocuting the nerdy with its back on a broken computer and its legs in some shed water. Oh dear ...
