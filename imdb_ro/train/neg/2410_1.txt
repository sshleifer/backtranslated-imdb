The Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films these guys have guided show have gathered and filmed this with their friends who have only one afternoon after being bored (the lines are completely unrecognized and unconvincing). I think 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home videos are better than this movie (although similarities justify comparison). "Hey lets you see if someone is stupid enough to buy our movies!". We hope no one was ELSE. I apologize to those involved in this process because this review is somewhat tough but I was the one who read my fake comments and bought the movie.
