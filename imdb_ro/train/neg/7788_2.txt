I have noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how they are "healthy" and "fun". These people have to leave the house more often. I do not know why there are shillings for this piece of pumpkin-filled fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no talent for acting, and his ineptitude is surpassed only by his star Pamela Austin, a previous model (another reason to outlaw the insidious practice of imposing talent models on an audience that does not one can expect, the habit which, unfortunately, persists until now). Good distribution (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) is trying hard to do something out of this, but without any use. I noticed that two directors shared the credits, although "credit" is not the word I would use (nor is the "director"). As for "healthy fun," there are plenty of such types of movies available without torturing loved ones, forcing them to stay around here. Find one of these movies and ignore it.
