Really, what is THIS? Hooper has made such classic movies, such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then made this dreadful movie, what happened? sank too much in crack? This movie is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to quit things (Firestarter, someone?), The action was eternal, the intrigue was garbage, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they seemed something of the '70s. Van Damme should be pleased with the fact that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever and what was the end? he began to shine blue, turned into a bright blue spot, blew the fire of his girlfriend and the film ended. WHAT WAS THAT? Not? when the movie ended, we were hoping the DVD would spontaneously burn to save me from pain. <br /> <br /> STAY OUT OF THIS FILM <br /> <br /> Do not believe, OBEY, you will thank me later.
