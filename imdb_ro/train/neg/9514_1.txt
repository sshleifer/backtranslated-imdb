Please exempt me from these films that teach us that the offense is fun and justified. The couple who has a sensational screenplay with an intense desire to be a Farrelly brother or a Coen brother plus the lives of another group of supposedly school-age people who act in their Dawson Creek theaters complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that tries make the movie feel cool and we have an intense and painful satire. This is not even shaken "Ferris Bueller" ... I prefer to see a change of traffic light. <br /> <br /> Only one scene stands out like anywhere near the admission price: when the girls at Betty Masked meet a friend of Richard Nixon Mascat. It's a surreal moment. Needless even. But for the rest, I'd rather have a toothache. At least I can apply some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
