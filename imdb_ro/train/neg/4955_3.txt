In light of the recent and pretty good Batman Brave and Bold, now is the time to take a fatal blow to this mistake in Batman's life. Being a huge fan of Tim Burton's first revival 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tones in character, darkness or campy. This is not only credible: too many effects, weak intrigue and so few questions. What is especially good for Batman is the variety of abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, criminal-warrior, playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows him only in karate days. By the way, why is the Penguin capable of such virtuosity when jumping in the air, regardless of his port body? And look at Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotype reggae man, what fan of Batman could accept such betrayal? Not anyway. Batman is much better without the "article" in front of his name.
