Wow - that's crap. I'll summarize it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A number invites 4 naive curves back to the castle. A lot of nothing has been happening for a long time. Several soft-core blades and non-erotic sexual scenes happen. Some girls cut their heads (off-screen) - The End. The only thing that happens is decent sets and suits, some wrong dabbies that lead to an unintentional fun dialogue, and some short shots of nudity. And believe me - these things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of the film that this film has. In fact, the best part is the beginning of the distributor, showing some yellowish chicken, covered in blood and showing his tits - and again - this is certainly not worth the admission price for this garbage. As everyone else has remarked - the title of the movie is completely meaningless, because there is no blood or dances of any kind in the movie. It may have been called "The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk" - and at least then it would have had a better title that also did not refer to anything in the movie. An exact title would have been "90 minutes of torture" - another appealing title that would at least be true ... for the spectator. Honestly - the disc trailer displays all the best parts (and I use the term "the best" extremely weak ...), so I suggest very well to watch that if you are still curious. I can not imagine no one likes a movie wreck - please take my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
