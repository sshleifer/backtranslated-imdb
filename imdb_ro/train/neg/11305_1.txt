This is a very bad western, mainly because it is historically inaccurate. They seem to have been shot on a back in California instead of where Jack Slade, Idaho, the Colorado and Montana Territories lived and died. He writes everything about this mysterious "evil man," "good man". The scenario is horrible; there is a very small direction and a weak action. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven does not seem to ever know how to describe this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a superintendent of the stage line. He was afraid of his locals for his heavy drinks. When he drinks, he'll start fighting and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To make sure he could never terrorize them, the vigilants licked Jack Slade after ignoring his warning to leave the city immediately. This is a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie except to see how Hollywood makes its history, even to the present.
