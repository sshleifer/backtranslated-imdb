I agree with all that people have said about it, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the biggest one I've ever heard of my whole life! There are real voices in the times when you have to listen to the actors! And the voice is like a large-scale version of the Danzig song, "The darkness of the forest, the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something so wicked. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a triple microphone over a certain crack section and fake batons. It's horrible !! <br /> <br /> Yes, male leaders are terrible. So are the women. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say revolves around a man or a female, playing only stereotypes to the maximum. It disgusts me. Soooo plictisitor !!! <br /> <br /> Children were so echoing in their lines, you could not understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear nice haircuts in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And the ghost guys always wore pants cut with shiny and shiny blond hair? It's not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was too loose and clean as that of a man who lived in a cave. Beautiful men and bangs, pa. Did you do a perfect knife or did you go to the city and go to the salon?
