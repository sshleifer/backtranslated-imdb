Carrie Fisher has said on several occasions that she made this film during a period of her life when she had a serious cocaine issue and did not remember too much about her. That would explain why he did this film, but he does not explain why someone else has been cast or crew; I can not believe anyone who has a coke problem. This has to be one of the most serious movies ever made and that says something. Guilt can not be put to the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, because it is obvious that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. It seems to have happened only spontaneously, because there is little evidence of consistency, consistency, design, plot, meaning, intelligence or anything else. What is really amazing is that there were a few real professionals involved in this issue. Co-star Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both veterans of the industry, Marks being also a director and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this pile of steam coal is beyond the deal. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director," has made many SF films and low-cost horror films, and after seeing most of them, I can tell you none of them is good at all. This, however, is by far the worst thing he ever did, and this is a major achievement on his part. Everything, absolutely, about this movie is the 12th rat - the best. The cinema is terrible, the act is ridiculous, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 in the cosmic space" look like "Spider-Man," the story is tribune, derivative and bad. Do not waste your time even if you look at the cover of the video box, do not let it rent. A complete, totally annoying, total.
