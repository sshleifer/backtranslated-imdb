Basically, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a wonderful and awesome movie, with several truly transforming winning characters. Watching the Detectives has none of them. The premise of a geek video store swept up by a mysterious mystery woman is a good one, but it is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the shifting of the leadership, not to mention the lack of any real style of storytelling. I mean, this movie is centered around the movies, but it's incredibly dishonest! But the main problem is that we simply do not care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any way. So the movie becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem to be, not really, very interesting. Oh, yes, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romanticism is not even romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid it. Even at the time of 90 minutes of operation, it is not worth to stay ...
