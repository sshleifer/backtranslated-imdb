I like movies. I like independent efforts and large studio productions. I like movies with stars and I like those with unknowns. I like dramas, comedies, adventures of action, science fiction, mysteries, western, any kind, except horror. I like foreign movies as well as those in English. I like good movies and I really love the bad ones, because almost no film can manage to entertain or amuse at a certain level. Except "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues". When I attended a late show of "Cowgirls," I joined an audience of about 10. Less than halfway, I stayed alone. Soon I could not even tolerate the disturbing mess that unfolded before my eyes and I left. So far, "Cowgirls" remains the only movie I've ever made. I do not really know how to describe this incoherent, naked, drawn, meaningless film or how to adequately convey the lack of redemption value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the most serious, all-time, absurd and unexplainable movies at every level. He tries to be intelligent, but his conception of feminism seems to be an anachronistic hopeless. Trying to be funny, but his humor is thick and worthy. This is one of the few films that can profane his own ethos by imagining the protagonists in the so-called way of revolting against themselves and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Water World", "Ishtar", other than that. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read a book in return.
