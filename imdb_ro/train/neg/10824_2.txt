This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's tired actor style is completely inadequate to Edward Rochester's daring passion and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a boring teenager whose dental legs hurt ! I also can not believe they removed the scene of Edward's great marriage project at the end of the book, one of the most exciting moments in literature. I appreciate that they used such a young and simple woman to play Jane, a character who should be a man in the world 18 but if you want to see a version that better approximates the personalities and passions of the novel, Version 70 with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and beautiful to play Jane, but nobody touched the character of Rochester as Scott did.
