I can not believe that those who praise this film here do not think about another movie. I have been prepared for the possibility that this is terrible, but the scenario (or lack thereof) makes a movie also useless. In addition, the general level of engagement by actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you have an ear to work with you, you can not make a silk bag. Ben G's fans should stay with almost any other film they were in. Dorothy S's fans should stay at Galaxina. Peter B's fans should keep up with the last image and target. Cheap laugh fans, to the detriment of those who seem to ask them, should stay in Peter B's amazingly terrible book, Killing the Unicorn.
