I have never been impressed by JD, and Final Justice (which I did not see before expressing MST3k) is not an exception. It's not that the character is less pleasant than Mitchell: it's just that Geronimo ("Call me" Heronimo) does not like it. In fact, one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all the schemes of Joe Don's revenge agent trying to kill the "star" by inducing a heart attack. Joe Don must have found a new agent because he graduated now in the James Bond movie. The problem is that it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters and his "serious" characters in his action movies like this. Repeat the same pieces repeatedly, you will think you are looking at Groundhog Day 2. Probably that they continue to use the same scene of Geronimo coming out of prison should be a comic relief of a kind Ummm, yes, anything else. the plus side, the scenery in Malta is quite superb, so it gave it to me for two. It has licked Maltese tourism a few decades ago.
