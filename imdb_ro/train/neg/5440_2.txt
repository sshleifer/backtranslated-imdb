I was a huge Lynn Peterson fan since her role in 1988's "Far North", and even if I loved her in another movie "Slow" (2004), where she interpreted "Francis" away from the role her most powerful. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of the Driver. than the amazing performance of Lynn, I'm afraid this movie is not going to go for it. Oh, wait - there was another thing - amazing editorial creativity to eliminate the profanity for the viewers. Memorable lines such as "Son of a gun!", "You son-a-witch!", "Shoot!", And "Well, look!" O.K. Bye. P.S .: Does anyone know where to get another poster Lynn Peterson?
