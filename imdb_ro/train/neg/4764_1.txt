86 minutes lost in my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to follow her and I have to say that I'm not someone to fall asleep in cinema. I have never seen such a useless plot act in such a style and forced, and can only assume that the actors were as hard as the protagonist who was supposed to be in the film itself. Everything in this cumbersome adaptation is overcome. And if it is not the wooden actor, almost as if you could see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overloaded and interfered in an absolutely unnecessary and exaggerated manner to an unimaginable extent, is enough to get you out of the farce. As for the alleged shock of a disguised detective, anyone who does not see that - like the rest of this absurd plot - has transmitted anterographic light in advance, should immediately check their eyes. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, and two very decadent actors together with the hyper-coded Brandadh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than goals you. <br /> <br /> Above all, there is a completely homoerotic subtle in this sense, exalted towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was a kind of flop that people will not try to imitate this cinematic level again.
