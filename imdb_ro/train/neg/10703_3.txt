but Thomas Ian Griffith just does not have the poles he has a big dollar actor, that was done 5 years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been programmed to do not just an action but a comedy. And how did you get KC from Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so horn that it would be better to fit into a Bullwinkle play. Personally, if action movements show skin - I would like to see equal time between women / men, otherwise you do not show anything.
