Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among those actors I always care to see, despite reviews. I have always found Mrs. Ryan as a charming and breathtaking actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth looking. I say "almost" and "almost" for the most part because of this movie. First, Meg Ryan does not play a nice character, she plays a weakly whiner who starts grating on the nerves shortly after the opening credits and does not give up until several days later. That being said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less pleasant. So even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend that you give this film a pass.
