This documentary (or I should say mockumentary) is a perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they have an enthusiasm full of something like that. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It's ignorance, it only destroys it. However, something positive in this sense was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some information in this mockumentary was totally false and it is truly disappointing because it comes from scientists, that's why it's worth one in ten and not 0. An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: it is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to be produced in those proportions, so in this case, you need an explanation good about what really happens in a dragon stomach. There are a lot of hydrogen substances in nature, but it's not necessary for an animal like this to fly, and hydrogen does not come out of anything, so it's impossible. Anyway, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold and I can not explain how the dragons survive according to that. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth, but at least that explains why they have disappeared. Cryptologists are probably called scientists, but they are not. People like them say the lie is that in this mockumentary, and what's worse, some people buy them. But I do not think a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
