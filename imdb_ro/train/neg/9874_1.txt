A fabulous book about a fox and his family who do what foxes do. that he steals from farms and kills the prey. until a trio of farmers decide that they have reached this fox and try in various ways to have the problem "solved". They are, of course, "clogged" at every step, and while the trio is reconciled to the foxhole, the family carries out raids against the three agricultural lands. The "movie" version and I use the movie very freely, is more of a terrible passion for American films, especially Oceans. They even have George Clooney like the fox to add to the insult and manage to completely miss the story. So you will make a lot of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl's book.
