this movie has everything; working with an abusive camera that reminds of martin or oliver stone, the tight action of "heat", the explosive action of a bruckheimer jerry film, the virgin dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic sense of saying "nose" the character retained by the judge displays a warm temperememt but also shows real depth and emotional intensity. his show reminds me of the role of robert de niro in Jake's interpretation of the motto in the bull that struck her. The action scenes are really stunning, not since bullit has a movie described by such high octane but elegant scenes. The special effects push the boundaries of technology and film to their limits. Independence Day set the standard according to which this film clearly corresponded and was largely overcome. In general, a great action from a distributed list (such as a list of invitations to the nightlife of the Oscars!), Classical Locations, and a tight script.
