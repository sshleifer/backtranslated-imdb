For a movie with so much promise, it was disappointing, very full of plot, and the script rang between terrible and unbelievable. The plot has more holes in it than Swiss cheese and it is the worst that ends with a clip I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have pulled my heart out if the whole movie would not have been so painful to get started. I was numb. From the first scene - a question was left if the sister tried to help the twins for help or just scared her to death, which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst act we have seen so far. It was horror in the true sense of the word.
