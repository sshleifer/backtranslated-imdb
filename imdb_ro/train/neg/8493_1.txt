Many days after I saw the Ada Conception, I'm still in danger that any group of people would spend so much time doing such an atrocious movie. No one should see this movie hoping to learn something about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. Also, nobody should see this movie hoping to be entertained. As SF film, it would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with him on his personal computer - with Timothy Leary's encouraging advice and words. I doubt that someone could suspend enough confidence to keep this absolutely absurd. As a drama, this would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. In a way, the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, useless, annoying and banal drama, essentially nothing. I doubt anyone could feel that all the drama in the movie serves only as an irritating distraction. It seems difficult for me to fully express my contempt for Ada's conception. The circumstances in which I have seen her forbid to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I'm still upset that I missed the time to see him. Just to be able to criticize this movie more effectively, I would like to be more articulate.
