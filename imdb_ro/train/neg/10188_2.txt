This juvenile, gentle stroke is strictly for adolescents in the old bodies of men desperate to withdraw their hormone-induced years of adolescence. How? By burning gas and equating a car (or a plane) quick and careless with freedom. The complaint borrows a lot from the neighborhood of Mister Rogers (if I was led a conglomerate of oil) and Logan's Run were strongly sedated and did not have a clear style of style). With Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this movie is in a post-gas-crisis world in which an almighty government does not want to (ahem *) drive the car and burn gas. As for the opposite of the current Enron-and-Bush government, which captures oil, SUV-pushing. Only this juxtaposition makes the movie ridiculous. But wait ... there's a lot more. Although the film is set in the future, we are not showing signs of future technology, beyond returning to bikes, golf carts and horses. You think the future looks ... just like today. The same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawns as today, and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, windmill, there are no concessions to alter the energy. The action is flat and odorless. Even the scenes that could have been in or on the move, amicultures, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase. Continuity is missing - the flight flew by Burgess Meredith's character changes color and configuration from moment to moment as filmmakers insult our intelligence with unparalleled film material again and again. The plot is equally moronious and only half as interesting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode. <br /> <br /> Even film machines and SF fans should avoid this movie like the one-month old roadkill if you do not enjoy the Exxon executives who are trying to make an empty movie like the hero's gas tank.
