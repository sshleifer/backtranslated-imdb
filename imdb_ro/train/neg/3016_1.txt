I am, as many as I am, a fan of Tony Scott's films. When this movie came out I had great hopes that it would be like "Man On Fire". To find out that the movie is the farthest thing out of this! The story was trampled by water, and Mickey Rourke's choice was not such a good idea. And the whole weapon was too free! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she will never become a movie star! The film has brought some of the worst things of all time. I like Tony Scott's direction, but that's all the cake! Sorry Ton, 1 of 10!
