The typical thriller has been done several times before. The simple structure of the plan; police officer Liotta gets obsessed with Russell's wife and tries to remove the good Kurt so he can have it. This is beyond predictability, do not even try to guess, intrigue is intrigue, and there is no thinking outside the box here. I think the only reason to be followed is to see how it develops, but nothing is initially or interesting. There is nothing to say about this movie, it is not very bad, but there is no good point. Russell plays Russell and you know what you'll get when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the sketch of the plot and I could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I looked at him and came out in front of my eyes just as I imagined. I did not feel a drop of emotion. I have no feeling about this movie, it's like I never would have seen it. Considering this, it's a pretty futile movie, is not it? Still, I'll give him 3/10 for a reason.
