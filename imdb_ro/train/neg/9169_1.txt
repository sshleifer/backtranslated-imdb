It's very bad. The only half-way redemption is the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the movie. There are context errors everywhere. The actor is horrible, except for Kirk. The story is as unlucky as speech, and the belief that the movie is a video game itself kills the film if it was not already a corpse. So everything is a waste of your life. I would have given a zero if it was an option on the rating scale.
