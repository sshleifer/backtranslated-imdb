With Knightly and O'Tool as leaders, this movie had good possibilities, and with McCallum the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw everything away on an evening of stupidity and then later with remnants of the Maudlin war. It was of course a superficial, beautiful and beautiful country in English and on the seaside or not. Counting was a mistake to rid Knightly so early in the movie when he was able to play with someone a few years older than to choose someone ten years older to play the role. They missed all the chances of having a big conflict between the cast and, instead, fired badly into the simple and inexpensive heart elements.
