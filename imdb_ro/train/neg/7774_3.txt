For half an hour or so, I remember thinking, "Hey, that might be Bill Rebane's best achievement ever!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, there are instantly scary moments, and our director even refers to his own stunning stinker "Invading the Giant Spider" in a playful way. The concept is stealthily stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill," with three old and extremely boring millionaires, luring the losers into an isolated mansion to earn $ 1,000,000 in a game elimination. Of course, the participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one and take too long the other greedy hostages before they realize that the old are sadistic ... or there is another killer among them. The movie begins and ends with a strange narrator, saying a lot of meaningless things that are not relevant or even interesting to plot, but there are some nice T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and that stupid bumboy (Shelly) is really hilarious to observe. After the first half hour, it naturally happens inevitably, and "The cold" turns into a Rebane production manual with delays in delayed plotting, the stupidest dialogues and a total lack of enthusiasm. There was no budget for bloody crime sequences, but our multi-talented director (?) Is trying to compensate for this with endless images of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different peaks and none of them is a bit easy. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: The Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
