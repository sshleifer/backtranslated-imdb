Why take a show that millions of us have watched and loved as children and made a full joke about it? He wonders why Hollywood does not make the usual money. Because they took out garbage and paid players huge amounts of money to be trash and asked us to pay $ 10 to see garbage. The television show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good boys of the IL are coming up. It was not gone with the wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with anything original to take something good and ruin it for some $. I only hope this movie makes 10x less than it costs to do. The only one of them is to have fun with this shit, the guys who came to rule General Lee. The public is the victim. You do not see him, watch the resume of the TV show. Still 20 years later.
