Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared with his brother, Frank ... well, give him awards now! Whale hat hair, muppet Frank seems to think that every party they play calls to get them refugee role American / Italian Wise-guy type of "godfather". Please someone to make an offer of action "he can refuse!" This movie just smells the place, even the terrible overloaded in it, Frank still steals the dishonesty that works. Everyone offsets its lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing his arms, making wild gestures in a style that went out of fashion back to silent films. Crying that is there, it makes no sense that catching a meteor and turns all women nymfele crazy, but because it is a film 15 certificates, this means only that they stick to their underwear and make sounds blackened such be dogs to heat. What happens in the end, I'm not sure if I was losing the will to live long before the movie ended. Avoid this like the plague and watch the movie "Deep Impact" for a reasonable film about a meteor to strike the earth. <br /> <br /> Purchase Order: when one of the female managers is crushed to her underwear has pants / panty garter belt / garter, knocking over straps to allow women to go to the toilet with less fussing . Probably a trivial point, but it shows how stupid this movie is when it can not even get that!
