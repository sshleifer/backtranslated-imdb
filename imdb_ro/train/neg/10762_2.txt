This was an impulse for me in the local video store. Do not make the same mistake that I did. This movie is boring, unconvincingly acted, and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is very poorly written and released; I went back to every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some rare appearances and is his usual disjunctive self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And while the movie is supposed to be in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like a Hollywood movie; all the main characters are Caucasians, and some have the tendency to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Strange. Anyway, when you see it on your local video store, you keep going.
