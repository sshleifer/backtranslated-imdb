You do not have much to say about it. Gammera is a kind of fire breathing tortoise. He is released from a nuclear explosion. He goes to the ground and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other junk (oh yes, the power lines, I almost forgot). At some point at the beginning of the movie, he is friends with a little boy and instead of throwing or crushing him, he places him on the ground. Sure. Since then, we have to see how this crackled face looks down, and that it runs, looks and runs, looks and flies. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this child 20,000 meters away. Well, the plot is to try to get Gammer to get to a place where he can be put on a rocket and shot in space. As usual, the monster is lumber and uncoordinated (a guy in Gammera costume). The Japanese Army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to solve the national debt and, of course, has no good. He should know that anyway. I've seen a lot of monsters in Tokyo. Let's not get them down, because they can be fun, but it really is not very good.
