All these stunning losses of film needs are due to the fact that Count Floyd appears every sixty seconds. Somehow they received Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and could not reach more than five kilometers, about eight kilometers from a real movie. BOY do this sucks. There is only one original line, thought, shot or effect from the brainless opening sequence to the pointless closure. The magic, etheric, Susan Anspach of five lightweight pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. Big bug-boring. If this is a frightening movie, Buttercream Gang is a frightening documentary. <br /> <br /> Really - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its evil. It is usually in the opening credits - "Written, Directed, and Produced by" a guy. Or even at the center of the action are some bimbo so talented that you know there is only one reason why the turkey was made. Here, you will not find out until the last faith, where the cooperation of about a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian government is acknowledged with gratitude. <br /> <br /> Right now I'm looking at the MST to take the Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste from my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
