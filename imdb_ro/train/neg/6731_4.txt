Contrary to another reviewer, I think this is well written, especially since it is fictitious, because it would require a greater imagination; and acted well, because there were no other characters to share the accent of these minute, plus and well-finished minute monologues.

These are just ten stories and very atypical issues, exemplifying how the life of any person (or part of it) is fodder for the film. Then, again, I'm thinking about TV shows as well. So, if that's your bag, you like that. It is the kind of thing that would do for good "phone and / or internet gossip, but absolutely no actions other than verbal. And although each of the speakers is female, I will give up this genre.
