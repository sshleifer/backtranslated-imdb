Zombie revolt is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty down the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick of making zombies after World War One, one of its members decides to use knowledge for its own bad ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first. A triangle of love complicates the story of some. It was really a boring movie, with a horrible adventure that made it difficult to tell who the zombies were and who were not. The dialogue was a bit better, and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part of it, but the parts related to "romanticism"). And while I'm not a student or an expert in cinematography, work on the camera did not seem to help much on the film. While I saw some of the worst movies, it's unlikely to thank anyone. It's bad, and not in a kind of bad-that-is-good way.
