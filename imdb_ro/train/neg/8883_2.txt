Cliff Robertson, as an angel husband, married to a wealthy wife, offers a dignified performance if she ever was one; as if director Michael Anderson continued to shout "call him down, think of the zombie, less lively," through his little bullhorn, while he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is a bit better; Jennifer Agutter from LOGAN'S RUN's fame is hard to see in what should have been defined as an essential role. If the quality of the act was three times better; if some of the most horizontal plot holes have been filled; and if an adrenaline blow had been given, then this robber could be brought to an acceptable standard for the crowd of the Hallmark \ Lifetime channel. As it is, its rating is so inexplicably high can not help chronic insomniacs thinking they use DOMINIQUE to catch a little delay time. Maybe telemarketers of late night TV have a major opportunity not to shilling it as such.
