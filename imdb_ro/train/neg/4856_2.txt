For my life I can not understand the blind hype and the devotion to this incredible movie ... and I think I have the qualifications to say that .... I'm a former soldier of 14 years of special operations in the lifestyle. This movie was completely unreal and obviously written by someone who did very little research about life in the army, in combat or team or platoon. <br /> <br /> Three EOD trouncing guys around Baghdad on their own ??? Get Real ... No Command Chain ????? Get Real ... EOD Compensation Buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified sergent buck ???? Get Real ... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and then I let the two boys take me without firing another shot or getting hurt at all ???? Get Real .... I have an Iraqi civilian carribe, while I am only 9 miles armed, enter another civilian house, get bored with his wife, then take her back to camp in the middle of Baghdad by night without so much like a scratch or confrontation ???? Get Real ... There is absolutely no adherence to the military protocol {Army} and no resemblance to any unit of the army that I have encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful of the men and women of the EOD, which, contrary to this bad movie, are not wildly adrenaline looking for yahoi, but highly qualified professionals do an incredibly hard job.
