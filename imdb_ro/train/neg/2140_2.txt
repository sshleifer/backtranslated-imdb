Assassin Hauser's (John Cusak) mission is to prevent a Middle East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the land of Turaqistan, which is ruled by American interests. Hauser presents himself as the manufacturer of the trade show to allow him to reach Omar. Sometimes a satire can be so troublesome it gets the most annoying. It does too much here: government, politics, music, war, people who are not generally accepted by society and mentioned "war". And that's what we have here - a very annoying movie bordering on a very bad nightmare that brought to life. I still wonder why I went on with the DVD. There are so many members of the Cusak family in this regard that John Cusak seems embarrassed by the family just being there, or is it just me? offbeat, was, in the end, pretty good. Not here. Do you think John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this misery. Make sure what you do. There are too many things happening in the movie, accompanied by permanent firearms, bombings, and shouting that you really can not concentrate or that's the point? Probable. It takes too long to fix the kick, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. Meanwhile, we have a meaningless banter among all those in the distribution. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think, but you know, the boy? girl thing ???? and they need something to take up more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what was supposed to be, (outside and annoying), Duff and Kingsley's performances were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd at the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet, taking a pit, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing praise about this effort, but if a rose is still a rose with any other name it's also a mess ?????????????????? Remember why we continued with the DVD. We hoped the story would be somehow saved. He never did. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
