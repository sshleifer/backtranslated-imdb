On behalf of Pinter, every knee will go - especially after his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which did little more than the preserved regurgitation by numbers, the sixth form of anti-Americanism. But this is even worse; not only is it a talent tournament, a great example of releasing yourself from its decades of reputation, but it also represents a slaughter of a beautiful piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theater production, and it's easy to see how it would be better for the plotter to work on the scene than the screen, but it still worked terribly well. This is a piece of vanity by Michael Caine, but let's face it, Caine is not Olivier. Not only can not fill Larry's shoes, he can not fill his bath shoes. Properly named dog is, in fact, an actor with a distinct average, whose only real recommendation, like many British actors, is their longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, great in Get Carter, but that's a lot, my friend! Give him a very wide place and stick to the superb original. This is more than half a pinter.
