Ritchie's first two movies were stylish and stylish entertainment. Here, he raids two recent classics? "Common Suspects" and "Battle Club"? and yet it comes out empty-handed. In spite of being paraded as a con-mystery (with the subtitle "Giant Suspects," the biggest result you ever shot convinced you to be "or whatever it was ...) and trying a contraction" Fight-Club "about the characters that are real and which are internal events, the film strives to keep its interest in the second half. Up to the last third, you know you're going down a blind alley, and slowly to that. Cons, the theory of chess games and games are all big issues, but Ritchie is heading too superficially and too fast to take advantage of the material. The only thing that keeps the movie (almost) pursued is Ritchie's bold way with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera.If Ritchie remained in a more satisfactory plot and yielded to a stricter editing, there is no reason why he could not have made another gangster good mood. The Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility is not equal to depth. If you want to see a wonderful movie that does not make a sense but makes a virtue of it (and incidentally, which also involves an unexplained escape from isolated isolation), watch "Lost Highway".
