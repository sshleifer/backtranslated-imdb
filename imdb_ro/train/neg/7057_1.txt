This is one of the most irritating nonsensical movies I've ever had the misfortune of staying. Every time it seems that they can do well, there will be more sepia tones flashbacks followed by paranoid idiots masked as social commentaries. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulator, a rebel who may be rebellious, living in an apparently no-parent mansion or responsibility. Supportive distribution is more enjoyable and interesting, but unfortunately it is never developed. We do not even really understand the character of John Stanton, who is supposed to influence Maddox to commit acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought "Maddox is just crazy and secrets all these Stanton communications, the stray patient!" Now we get somewhere! but, of course, this is not the case, and the film proves to be useless, both from the perspective of Maddox and the spectator. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him?
