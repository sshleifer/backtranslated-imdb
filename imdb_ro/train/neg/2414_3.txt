I happened to watch this movie on the shelf under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie movie too exciting to get through. It was billed on the box anyway, and I thought, "What a great idea!" In addition, there is a "Welcome to Oakland" sign on the cover. How can I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as the opening theme. Neither hip-hop nor hip-hop culture played an important role in the film. After I lived in Oakland, I know there are many aspiring hip hop artists there, so the low budget of this movie was not an excuse for not having a proper soundtrack. Any number of artists who struggle would be jumping on the occasion to contribute to this film. Why the Quiroz Brothers did not take advantage of this is beyond me. Once the movie was rolling, it was a typical zombie movie with a cast that just happened to be completely black and Latino. You might think that this would put a little unusual in the movie ... but it did not. In a way, the Quiroz brothers' vision of "urban culture" is reduced to shooting and spreading a F bombard into each line of the film. Rapid use of the word "fuck" is probably the most distinctive feature of this movie; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I'm not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas from the writers (and Quiroz brothers), and the script was generally very poor. The film was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a truly "urban culture" zombie hit, but "Hood of the Living Dead" fails to matter. The characters in the movie could be as easy as white or eskimo or anything else. There is no distinctive flavor of the film. It's just another low-budget shot, a bad act, bad writing, amateur direction, gentle cinema, a cheap soundtrack, and nothing to recommend.
