This movie was terrible in the worst way: it simply did not care. You did not care what happened in the plot; you did not care about your characters. Everyone was heartless. I finished walking about 45 minutes, because I simply did not want to put my mind to her more. There's too much sex in the movie. Sex may be fine; may even make the movie (here Karma Sutra), but sex was not beautiful or sexy. It was ugly. You do not see this movie.
