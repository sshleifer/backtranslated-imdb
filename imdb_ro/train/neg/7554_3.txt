I have never seen the older version since 1973. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, acting well as usual). This movie lasted probably all five minutes to collide the whole plot (I see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a party), if you can not figure out the end of this salt in the first thirty minutes you'll probably have this movie it's fun. This is, unfortunately, the terrible route that Hollywood seems to have dug up with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, incapable of giving the audience enough credit and writing a fresh, smart and tantalizing screenplay, and throwing a few things to make you skip a little and then send the final definition to the local theater. At least he did not have jiggling hand room syndrome.
