I'm sorry to the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, castrated badly and mistakenly acting is a movie that tries to get rid of dead romances in recent years and fail! McDonald and Parker seem to be unable to convey real emotions and are devoid of life. They seem to be in this place for any check checks they receive for him and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is DULL !! I like the movies with the chickens as much as the next girl and that's not one! If you avoid a movie this year ... let it be
