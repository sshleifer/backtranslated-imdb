I just went to the 99st cents store today and I think I was kidnapped. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gym drama and $ 1 is too expensive for that. This movie is probably just remarkable for 2 things: 1. Has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who made Night Promo. Now on the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a girl called Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), who is seriously injured by a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the crash prevents him from competing in gymnastics tournaments, is often gathered during her classes, and eventually meets a wild kid called Tommy (played by Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, works part-time together with her mother and herself, at her own laundry, which was owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> Overall, just Keanu and some funny songs from the 80's are what prevents me from giving this star a star, and there is none of the worst movies ever, but still far from good . The DVD itself does not receive any medals because it seems to come from an old VHS and finally the sound does not synchronize, and when the final credits end, it fades in black even if the sound can still be heard. So perhaps this may have gone like a bootleg. The DVD artwork does not make any sense because it has what appear to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the movie, just like in the movie itself, so coverage is obvious your pic. In any case, avoid at all costs if you are not a fanatic Keanu. I'm probably not going to hang on to her anymore. I'll probably give Snob to the Cinema, which is a great YT critic. Hey, if any of you have terrible movies he no longer wants in their eyes, feel free to donate them to keep their show on the move.
