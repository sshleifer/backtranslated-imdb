I've loved Apprentice for the first two seasons. But now with Season 5? (or is 6?), things just become too tiring. I liked the show, but it became Donald Trump's own ego event. He's given the company you're working on, but come on! some of the things you say "YOU ARE DIE" are just insulting. After seeing the show, I would not want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or so. Just that the show is unrealistic and how it handles things makes me change my mind. Good entertainment? Yes, but tiring, because the back stabbing becomes so tiring, not the teamwork, not the staff, the business. watch your headphones.
