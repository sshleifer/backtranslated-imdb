Regarding Western Spaghetti, I put this man can not die on the boring genre. Not that the film is particularly bad, but lacks brightness and brilliance of some of the other SW that we saw. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but no onscreen charisma necessary to remove it. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. It's not too much to be very excited. The exception is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in the otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb page for this man can not die is gre≈üit.Rosalba Neri plays Jenny Benson, but character Melin.Nu sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha listed in film credits IMDb. )
