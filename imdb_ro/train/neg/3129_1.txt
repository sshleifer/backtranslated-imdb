I had time to kill before watching football, so I saw that this movie was offered on the Scifi channel and literally after watching them I thought I met my version of mental marching Bataan's death, because my conscience was beaten up in a movie submission that broke the mummy series and the Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought opening credits were the culmination of the film and then went into such an awful discovery that it made the recent fall in the stock market seem like a hiccup. The act was so bad that we hoped one and all would be buried at the end. Casper Van Dien's lead made me a lot of time for Steven Seagal's role in "On Deadly Ground," while his lecture was so woody that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo stand on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression that my cats were more expressive when asking popcorn to eat. The direction was so steep that I looked again at the desire to play my third-grade nephew's recital, which had a better rhythm and a better vision, and the fact that this film seems to have been merged from the latest ideas of the film films mentioned above, a tribute. The movie FX was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were ecologically friendly by recycling some cheap special effects from the Z grade horror movements of the past few years. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in these films is beyond me and should look at litigation against his agents for distorting them to get them involved in such a movie. My warning to all is watching this movie at your dangers, as this movie can cause your IQ to drop with prolonged viewing. On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes movie wages are published I was wondering if it is a way for actors who should pay back their wages for their poor performances in such films. Be afraid and safe at all costs.
