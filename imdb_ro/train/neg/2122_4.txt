Although, in some aspects, Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narratives, Gabriele Muccino's project is quite mediocre. The film is becoming healthier and more manipulative, while moving towards the end: human and emotional hearts, physical and metaphorical eyes. Seven pounds is more of Amore Perros's amateur imitation from Alejandro González Iñárritu and 21 grams, with many and many flashbacks. The problem is that the story is quite predictable from VERY easy on the film. It's too bad, because seven pounds might have been as authentic if Ben and Emily were in their right hands.
