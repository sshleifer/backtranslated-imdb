a story of love without sensation, a drama of trouble without point (or drama) .... This movie should be all this and fails in every account, as if it would not try. Or as if the team of director / editor / writer did not really try. Actors are capable - they need better support. One item that fails is George Delarue's score. Beautiful and on the move. What shame is attached to this film. In a good film, actors say the movements and music synchronize and amplify the impact. This publisher placed on music without considering dialogue and movement. The scene of love is especially the grid in this respect: an insult to the talents of the main actors. There is another feature in the movie that works: shooting the location. Especially a moment in Grand Central Station. I guessed in advance what would happen; but the way she was filmed in that frame was staggering. Some commentators on this forum have pointed out that American assimilation of Nazi criminals has actually happened during these years of MacCarthy's scarecrow. When the film seems to begin to look seriously at American society, it turns into conventional romance; Before any human feelings can move us, it is far from a "thriller" escape (predictable). Just as the movie insults the talents of the actors, insults the problems they claim (and fails) hold on. <br /> <br /> You are warned.
