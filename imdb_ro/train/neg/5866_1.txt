I remember this movie when I was 13 (it seems like many reviews say the same thing as the age of 13) with a group of school friends. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first film and fell for typical commercial ads telling us it was a big comedy. I suffered about 45 minutes and we agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and a cry out of Billy Crystal's ability to make us laugh, did not laugh. I came across this review by chance and I decided to register just to tell the rest of the world about what a movie loss that was, now if you rent it, you deserve what you get, you have been warned!
