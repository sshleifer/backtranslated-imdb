No one but anyone could chew the landscape like the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example of why. Although she sometimes overlaps the play, look at her when she thinks Raliegh writes the lyrics to a song that the waiting ladies are about to play: at that moment we understand how Elizabeth managed to lead and master absolutely! At other times, it is over by the mistakes of the scenario. When Elizabeth must be vulnerable, she moves away weak and weak. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice, it is hard to take it seriously. Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex was able to worm him in Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inappropriate to convey the complexity and evil of man. It also does not help that Essex is insufficiently subscribed. Why is this hot man wanting to overthrow the Queen - even while he swears his fidelity - except that he has more blue blood, so "dignified" as a rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and the letters of Essex? He does not risk falling out and we know where Essex is headed (and his head). So why risk their own head, accelerating the inevitable? What did Curtiz do with all that was given to him? He does not even bother to try to conceal the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sonic scene. She should have ended with Elizabeth for the first time alone at The Tower; everything else (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is useless. The costumes are fantastic. And am I Bette or just like Susan Sarandon?
