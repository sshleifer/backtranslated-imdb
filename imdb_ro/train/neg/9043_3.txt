I went to see this with my wife and my son for three years. He seemed to like much more than my wife and I did. Writing is surprisingly poor for a Pixar / Disney trip. In fact, we had a very difficult time to pay attention. The film looks amazing, but the story becomes so strange and long-lasting that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could take him and go. I do not say the movie is not an interesting concept, it just said so weird (bad scenario?), Especially when we meet for the first time in the family. I know we should have the impression that the family is happy, but good, that could have shortened that sequence with 15 good minutes (apparently I did not want to do it.) At that point, I scratched my head in search of an exit.
