I took the DVD very cheaply and I'm a total Drewbie, and that's probably the only constellation in which this movie could ever interest anyone. An early Drew movie looks good and a lot of very cute scenes out of it like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, pretty sexy clothes, etc. She never shows the friend's charm we know in her more recent films. the film itself is quite medium or sub-environment, and much more than it would have done for the television than for the cinema. There is no real horror or build tension, and dialogues are often cheeses. The most interesting part is probably the end, because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe there's nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you do not reach the end that you would expect, and it also comes much sooner than expected. Overall, I think this movie is exclusive to Drewbies.
