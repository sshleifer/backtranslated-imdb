This film has to be in line for the most boring film in recent years. Not even Harrison Wood can save this movie from sinking to the bottom. Crime in this movie should be the point of interest in this movie, but it is not, nothing is of interest. The cast is not bad, but the script is simply terrible, I just stood amazed during this film, thinking how someone can find this fun movie. The producers of this film were very skilled. They made a boring movie, but they hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and they will probably see this movie and I think Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe must be good and rent this movie (boys are in awful time) <br /> <br /> you like to ruin, go and rent this movie, some people enjoyed this movie, but I like to watch a movie of significance
