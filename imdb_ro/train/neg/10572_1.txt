*** SPOILERS SLIGHT *** A 15-year-old boy kisses a pretty 15-year-old girl and finally makes her sex for the first time. By the act, she sits in bed without touching her. The next day, he concludes that he does not like sex too much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years. This is apparently a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy who discovers homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-puberty teenager with a severe hormone deficiency. However, as the plot develops what appears to be a story of a 15-year old who is sustained and encouraged by his arrogant mother. At one point, his mother teaches to his colleagues who are not as compassionate as they are: "Every step in this way, my son was amazing ... I was never more proud of him ..." Her older sister, who is otherwise cold to her brother, starts to boast with her brother: "this" because it gives him a warm and warm hug. The 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a parent. Why not? We see the new baby a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy and happy baby for 4 months. Just as the children were born on television in the 1960s and 1970s. Once the young father is a parent, he found happiness. He insists he will be the one who will change the dirty nappy. We see that the 15-year-old father, happy, keeps his baby while the mother loaded by the teenager rises over his shoulder. Fade to black.
