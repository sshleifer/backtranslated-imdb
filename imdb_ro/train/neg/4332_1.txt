This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original gained such recognition was strictly related to the fact that it should have made you feel incomplete. This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a bad guy, but the guy who works in this movie is ... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I'm sorry I had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this movie. I still like the original and will do my best to keep this film from ruining my opinion about it.
