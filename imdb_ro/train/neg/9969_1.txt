I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a movie. I was not even attracted for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw all the themes they could think they were hoping for something to stick to. I would bet (and hopefully) that all those involved in the professors look back with embarrassment. There are some great actors here, but you will never know. We thank God for not destroying the careers of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no love work here, just a horrible effort went wrong. BTW I do not think the writer ever put his foot in a real school.
