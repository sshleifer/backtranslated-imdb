Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel has a pretty strange idea and it does not go too far to get a story out of it. Practically, Alice at number four is pregnant and her child is haunted by Freddy, who gives her a snatch to haunt her friends. This has the fewest deaths in the whole series, and wise cracks are pretty weak, so horror fans and comedy fans are not happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about it. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but it's not worth watching a movie. Uninvestitor and unenjoyable, possibly only the competing direction saves him from being the worst in the series.
