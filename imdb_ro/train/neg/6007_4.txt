Surprisingly, the movie has a certain quality of redemption when it moves towards the end. On the other hand, this film is a very bad and torturous film, with a small budget, a badly insulted script and everything that matches it. It is silly that with all the money that goes around the Christian Circles can not get enough funds to make a decent film. I'm not religious, so I'm not interested in less, but filming makes some make a good tool to get a new audience for churches and to attract people more interested and curious in reading the Bible for example. In this sense, these films always seem like a scattered opportunity. The low budget really makes the film bad and brings it down. She makes the movie ridiculous to look at its effects and just gives the film a campy B movie as a feeling. But what this film suffers most is its writing. Things that happen only in this movie are just insulting to intelligence and then I'm not even crying about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way in which the film progresses is equally unlikely, and the people in this film make such unlikely things that it is insulting to its viewers. I also watched the movie as a ditch. It seemed to me that they had a hard time turning this movie into a complete movie and added some dramatic characters and evolutions just to fill things up. I would not really care less about it at all. Still, we have to say that the film becomes stronger and firmer towards its end, when its story becomes more focused on its essence. Still, it remains predictable, but it has prevented this movie from being a complete epilogue to watch and, in terms of these types of movies, I'm a lot worse to watch there, although I do not think this movie will win over anything new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
