Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a senior class housewife who lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband, Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). She gives the attention of the twins, neglecting their home and appearance, and upsetting Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she runs at the local mall at night to buy gift wrapping paper and finds no available parking space. When she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish bastard". When the mall closes, Della's car is held by the old car driver and she is threatened by four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomas (Luis Chávez). When the mall guard protects her, Chuckie's head shot, Della speeds up her car trying to escape the criminals. However, she crashes her truck near a forest, followed by tape. She takes the toolbox and is hiding in the wood, fighting the gang to survive. A few days ago, I saw the trailer "While It Was Out" and I was anxious to watch the DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie and I am totally disappointed with this tedious and implausible collection of clichés. Della Myers is portrayed as an insecure, negligent and non-existent housewife; motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. She is being pursued by four criminals, but she defeats them with a set of tools that seems to be Batman's utility belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that irritation. The Criminal Gang is made up of the favorite clique of American films, an African-American, a Chinese-American, and a Latin, together with an American lord to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent attitude, but the kids are too young for a fifty-year-old woman. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("As she went out")
