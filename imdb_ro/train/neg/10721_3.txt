An expedition led by captain Storm (Mark Dana), a traveler, goes to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. Meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins. Soon they face a mummy of blood drink ... and Simira just seems to know what's going on. A real snoozer. I caught this on TV late at night when I was 10 years old. I fell asleep! I see again all these years later, I see why. She moves slowly, the mummy does not appear even up to 40 minutes in (and it only has 66 minutes!), Actuating from evil (Dana) to REAL evil (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to find. This film focuses more dramatically on the second rate (involving a triangle of bad love) than on horror. This three-star rate, because it looks pretty good, every one plays right, there's a good action from Diane Brewster, it's short, and the mummy attack scenes (all three) are not bad. They are not frightening, but just frightening. However, this movie is pretty bad. A safe fire treatment for insomnia.
