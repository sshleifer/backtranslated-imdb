SPOILER ****** ****** One of the speakers radio show that Kyser and his band are mediocre excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to take a salary in this gentle, doll haunted house. Lugosi is a mystic whose chances are exposed as fraudulent attempt to strike a wealth of heirs; Karloff is butler and Lorre is a professor false media exposure, but it seems that both are conspiring with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his band of children 30 years reveals the truth as possible with a minimum of humor along the way. It not recommended any absolute absolute horror.
