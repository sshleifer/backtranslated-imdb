I checked this on a DVD for a dollar, so we could smile with ease as this terrible movie unfolds. every time you think you can not get worse, it's inevitable. The act is absolutely horrible. the plot has no meaning. The title "Cold revenge" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The scenes of action are so obvious in their first making. There are a lot of mistakes during dialogues that indicate that there is no intention of doing anything else to try at least to make this movie supportive. I do not remember seeing a movie worse and sometimes I do wrong - unless you can not stop Wesley Snipes. No, who's joking, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture Oscar prizes compared to this piece of nonsense.
