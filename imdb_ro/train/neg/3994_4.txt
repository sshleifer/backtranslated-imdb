I'm a great fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a little less fond of Stephen King, but I like part of his work. This told me that I should have loved him in 1408. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** We went happily. I was disappointed. It's not the blame of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson have both very small roles, as the premise of the film puts Cusack in the "guy in a closed room" scenario. It was not a BAD movie, but I can not call it either a good one. It was a muddied misery that had moments of "ouch, thats just WRONG", combined with moments of "ouch that is just painful," and moments of "oh, now it's just unhappy" with very little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father appears once and there is no apparent connection with Mike's personal life that we see as he tries to survive the room. <br /> <br /> A previous commentator described Olin / Enslin's argument as worth watching and I strongly agree. But beyond that, apart from some intelligent musical hint (the almost awful camera of Enslin torture, and gives him a chance to get out before raising the ante ... at what point he gives him an hourly counting clock and the titular line from carpenters "We just just started") is more "things jumping to you when you least expect!" a type of horror that was fun when I was fourteen years old and surrounded by my age friends, holding each other in the summer, while Jason watched Camp Crystal Lake. The rest of the film was "to make it come back from its most painful experiences" the mind, with "animating the paintings in awful ways" clisterizare clisicÄƒ. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better out of this movie with the name of Stephen King attached to him as well as the actors which I mentioned above. We never discover the origin of evil. We never get to see the defeated evil, although we can assume that maybe it was defeated. And the end was just a shameful "What?" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable launch. I would not have wanted to pay for it as a matinee, but I felt a little changed because I paid the night's opening prices for her.
