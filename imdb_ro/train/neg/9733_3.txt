Pretty poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a feature film. How disappointing it is to come from Hooper and Dourif! Government contractors make a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The experimental couple's born boy continues to have a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, people in his life begin to spontaneously burn. He's trying to find out why. The people who are fully lit up are well-made, but when they get to the point where they are well made in a different sense, they obviously turn into mannequins. When the jets shoot out of the arms of the characters, it looks rather stupid than alarming as it should. It is also ridiculous a fire that obviously travels through telephone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver of the receiver. How is that supposed to happen? Another thing that hit me like silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents. Later we see exactly the same photos of those visions in home movies.
