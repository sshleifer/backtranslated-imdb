Working at a video store, I've seen some movies and occasionally try to watch some of the movies that are not that big. Pride was one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling about the story of a ship equipped primarily on black during the Second World War had some merits. However, in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie, find out that the main focus of the film was to say about racial tension during the Second World War. The basic story relates to the ship, its crew and their exploits at war. This primary point is forced to you to the point of excessiveness throughout the film. I congratulate the people who served the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the difficulties they have endured. A film should have focused on the achievements these people made for themselves, for Marina and for their country, and did not make a film whose focus was racism during World War II.
