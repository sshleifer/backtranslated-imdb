This movie has some of the worst things I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as nails that come through the floor. This angle trap catches these bad guys. The rest of the movie degrades as you go. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the 100 lower-level films of all time. Also, I can not believe there are sequels! The next nonsense movie I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R. be much worse than this one?
