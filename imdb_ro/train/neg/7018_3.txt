All to forget. Especially because of poor drive. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he was around in the late 1990s. I thought he was a newcomer because his acting was so gentle. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw him well in other films, he gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character an emotional personality, natural like Diane Keaton, but it would have been strange to see her telling her lines in the way of the lizard. It just seemed like there was not really good chemistry among the actors, and I think Diane Keaton felt that. She is a fantastic actress, but she looked a little over the top of this movie. She felt like she just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I'm not blaming her.
