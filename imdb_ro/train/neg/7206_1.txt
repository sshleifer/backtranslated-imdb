Good. Where to start. Let's say that; avoid this movie at all costs. It's based on a series of cartoons. The film makes the appearance of cartoons like Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be here, unpleasant camera work, terrible music and product placement enough to make you never want to visit Yahoo! Again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett were piling up this image with the homosexual abandonment of men who saw a rare salary in the distance. <br /> <br /> They should pay us some millions of money they have earned to track them.
