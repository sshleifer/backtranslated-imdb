This is a very expensive shot of a werewolf. The video is dark and slightly lit. The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a junk sewn with regular characters, like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with the silver gun! [of course, with silver bullets]. The actor is wooden like the characters. FXs are non-existent, a lot of extreme closures of werewolf peaks and bites. the only thing that's shown is a lot of soft-core T & A. Instead of giving up $ 30 for this tribute, check out a real old elderly werewolf: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
