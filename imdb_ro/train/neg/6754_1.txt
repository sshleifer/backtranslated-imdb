The only reason I bother to comment on this movie is to save you 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. I bought her ex-hire for Â£ 3.00, it looked interesting, so I had a chance. Within a few minutes of starting, I realized that I made a mistake. The entire caste must be stored until the winter and then thrown on the nearest fire log, where it could meet more than that. As for Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), it should just be shot, unfortunately this should have been done before doing this garbage. Avoid this movie, if you see it in stores run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
