The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantastic movies. They were always ready to destroy the cities of huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from the huge octopus to the huge lobster trying to have a higher hand on people. It is extremely weird and ridiculous but also pleasant. After all, we like these creatures and these movies after all, do not we?
