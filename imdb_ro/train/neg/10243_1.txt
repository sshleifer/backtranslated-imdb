This is the biggest bunch of nonsense I've ever watched. NOT RENT! Producers of this film should be the band to ever make another film. It begins with something about a plot, then fades quickly to nothing. I think I'd rather look at the dry paint, then look at the cover. The actors were terrifying, the plot was fading fast, the shootings were a lot of work. It's not a good thing to say about this movie. If you rent this movie, you will lose money. I really like Lampoon's national movies, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to drive. I think I should sue these holes that made this movie for the money spent on the cost of rent and lost time.
