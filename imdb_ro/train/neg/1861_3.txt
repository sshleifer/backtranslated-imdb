Do you know what movie you are entering when the serial killer's main character is transported to the electric chair (in what appears to be a bakery truck) just to have a prison vehicle colliding (and do not do that ) a tanker for genetic engineering. The goo that makes it melt melts and merges its DNA with snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman. My favorite part of the movie is a shot over the shoulders of the snowman by knocking some poor schmuck, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white fur gloves.
