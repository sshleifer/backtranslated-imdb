The memoirs of a geisha are a beautiful movie, there is no doubt about it. And the action is generally excellent, at least as far as describing the characters as they are written. However, so many small and big details are just _wrong_ that I bother too much to be able to fully enjoy. A small detail that characterizes the type of lack of sensitivity is a scene where Mameha sounds a bell hanging at the door of the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy winter day. The bell he rings is a noise or wind noise - which is left outside the house of Japan in the summer of the year! The people in the traditional Japanese houses did not have the buzzers - they just opened the door and they were announced. (Maybe you think this is such a trivial detail, but I would be like a movie about America, where a Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and no one thinks about it). And I do not even start on the wrong mickey and geisha hairstyle, which is vaguely pan-Asian / chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like a real thing. I think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture that it is trying to portray really appears in the attitudes and images of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose that, the less you know about Japanese culture and the Kyoto geek and maiko world (which is what is "Miyako"), then I think you will enjoy more thing. I honestly think this movie could have been much better ... as it is, it's just another version of Hollywood's "exotic Japanese".
