Julia Roberts is obviously making a concerted effort to shake Pretty Woman from cotton wool with this spousal abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine that she will finish such a strong and convincing performance (and Oscar-winning) Erin Brokovich, based on the back of these garbage. And do not bones about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the least lacking in that. The plot has all the signs of a late night made for the cable and do not be impressed that it will give a glimpse of the dark world of domestic abuses, because the characters are not drawn enough to truly care for you. Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Roberts' name above the title, I'm sure it would have been completely flopped, worth it.
