My first clue about how bad this was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Witch project, which was a masterpiece compared to this garbage. The actor was on the scale of a sixth grade production in Oklahoma, and the plot, as it was, was predictable, boring and inertial. 85% of the scenario are four-letter words and countless variants. Mama F seems to be the "writer" favorite because it is used constantly. It must have passed all 10 minutes to write this script in a certain diving at the last call. Thank God I rented it and I could go through most of it on fast ahead. Do not waste time or money with this.
