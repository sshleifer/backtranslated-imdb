"Detention Drawing 9" is a kind of movie that one loves or hates; fortunately or not, I let him with a strong sense of time lost and being completely filled with "whaling killing is bad" propaganda. From an aesthetic point of view, the film could have been enjoyable, especially in the first half of it, until it is clear that each portrayal action serves as an allegory of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it would be a little fun to look at the day-to-day work of Japanese workers, but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is propaganda and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda," because the film uses the old moral play device, where "good" and "evil" are not deducted during the action, but are stone. Probably just me, but I find a kind of superficial and preconceived art, even if it is the nobleman (without sarcasm here) to protect the environment. In my opinion, it is a cardinal pity when film material is stretched without any justification, for the sake of the stretch. In my opinion, "Detention Drawing 9" could easily be adapted within 75 minutes, but has a torture duration of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting photos, but they were not enough to leave nudes for 15 minutes without notice. The film does not have a standard scenario and there is no evolution of the characters, but no documentary, but a kind of conceptual installation. This is an unusual form for a movie, but it can be seen as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also think the director should have been honest and would not have pretended to be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. And yes, the music score resembles the whale sounds the most. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
