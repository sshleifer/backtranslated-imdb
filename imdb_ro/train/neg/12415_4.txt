I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was just a standard, very gentle detective show, in which, as each Quinn Martin shows, act I was the crime, Act II was the main character who invented the crime, Act III (the second character was killed), Act IV was the resolution, and Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether), asking his father, Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen), how he realized the murder and then someone who said something wonderful at the end of the show. One thing I remember was the excellent thematic song of composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely, the credit opening sequence made me want to see the show and for the seven seasons the show was in the air. I will also recognize that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett, despite the fact that Ebsen was badly ill. I just wanted the show to be more fun than when I remembered it for the first time. Update (1/11/2009): I've been following an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through the American Television Channel. Let's just say I was more kind than Goldsmith for the Barnaby Jones show.
