In what might have been another movie scene, the mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle period of "free love"), the creators of this film are piling up after a ridiculous script after a ridiculous script, a little cherry on top, happy ever after it's over. I have never felt sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their free middle-class care life, nor did I feel for Liev Shrieber. The story line is slowly heading to its predictable and pathetic conclusion and the only interesting thing about this movie is the amazing Diane Lane topless. Here's a clue: it's about 30 minutes in the movie. Move that part quickly and pass the rest.
