Horrible film with the pieces of Ramones scattered. Your format worse than the average in the '70s / 80s of the bad kids who take the school with a capricious plan. This movie is terrible. The plot is composed of a girl who enjoys Ramones and a school tilted to fight against their oppressive administration. Watch this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want a fun B movie. Terrible action, terrible writing, terrible plot with Ramones' approval stamp, which probably needed some money quickly, so they said yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows.
