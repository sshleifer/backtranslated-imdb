This thought thought for a long time, sometimes, is available on the web. So I bought a copy. Of course, the act is terrible and the story line is childish, but it has its moments. I believe that people who have searched for this also know their history. It was made by a cinema owner for a very low budget. But for me, he did not spoil money on the props, but on the make-up. The form is for a kind of good flick. The zombies are monitored and the gorillas are intact. The only problem with such films is the quality of the film. It's terrible, fortunately no sound on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see the gorilla. In a fun way, they tried to sell it like it really did not for squeamish. A voice-telling says at the beginning of the movie to take care of a sign and a man who appears with green flashes, telling you that there are gore on the road. Of course they did not work, they made me think of the Cannibal Girls, they had that annoying bell when the red stuff began to run. They had the initial idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go to the story, go to the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. When the girl and the guy make love first she takes her bra, then makes love and suddenly her underwear turns around ... try to do this or I'll be a little off, ... eat your ugly corpses
