Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely awesome in this movie, but the story is unfortunately half-baked, and David Schwimmer's energy is a kind of cold food. When she closes her mouth and becomes serious for a moment or two, there is a lot of what she could have been. Who thinks that 25-year-olds would be fun?
