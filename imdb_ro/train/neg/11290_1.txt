The worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure," but was changed to "The Shark Treasure" to take advantage of the enthusiasm created by "Jaws." I think the sharks were in a scene of this film; the fact that they were included in this "thriller" had to sell tickets. It did not work. Whenever something "good" happens in the movie, the crew of the ship flies each other with a certain beer brand that was just introduced at the time of the movie. Gee, do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Could it be more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is if they manage to do this. That's enough to celebrate.
