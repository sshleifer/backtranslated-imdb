what an absurd story, blackmail, sex accusations for children, homosexuals, and the Catholic Church ..... Absolute tribute. How is it that most of the UK television drama, comedy, etc. must include the gay, tiring, tiring now. Everyone accepts the fact that there are people in the society but there are other minority groups, but we do not want to shoot our neck (I'm going to go over that) in every show. In addition to the above, the drama went from what might have been an interesting story in the pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays to run around each place, oh just to be a total PC of gays was black. I'm surprised by Ecclestone for contemplating this even when reading the script.
