"Nada" was the most inappropriate sequel to the film "Les NOces Rouges," which, with retrospect, now appears as the last good film of Chabrol's golden age (1967-1973), "Nada" is his first real attempt Chabrol in a political film "Nada" also includes terrorists, ambassador, hostage-taking, a lot of blood, not even Chabrol's. A heterogeneous distribution gives the film the graceful hit: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel is getting out of the box. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("at Belle Equipe" "Panique" is wasted as a lady (Gabrielle). Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are terrified. Chabrol will be "Violette Nozi√®res" before being back at the top of the game.
