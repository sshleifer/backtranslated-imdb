This "Joshua" movie is extremely disturbing, and useless. In fact, it makes me bother to think there are people who would like to look at it. Without telling the story, it's the boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the movie, the spectator is subjected to some of the most troubled behaviors of the imagined child. Adding insult to the injury, there is absolutely no real outcome until the end of this film, except for the achievement of pure evil in the hand of a child no less, who has overcome a whole group of bad adults. There is no redemption, no justice is served, and a whole group of adults who are not intelligent enough to see what is happening around them. Frankly, I did not like to see this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who might enjoy horror movies, this movie may be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well treated, the story itself is so disturbing that observation was equivalent to waiting for 90 minutes in a dentist's waiting room waiting for a painful dental procedure.
