Now, please do not start telling me names like "careless", "weird" and many more. The length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. Without editing - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours - but it was fun and gave a message as well. It is based on real incidents and real people. Kudos, but were indeed repeatable war scenes needed? Moreover, the accent has constantly changed from one battalion / squadron to another, and it was impossible to keep track of all this. Between the smashing, there were songs about loneliness, love, and the like. There were fiery discussions. At first he gave some relief of violence, but he became so monotonous later that he could even accurately anticipate the nature of the future discussion. Why were soldiers walking like lions in the jungle do not know the enemy was hiding somewhere near? And when they were shot, it made sympathy, but it seemed unimaginable to be so cocoon for their safety, first of all. The music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful, but they did not match the movie. Better to listen to them on the soundtrack and not in the movie. The action was the rescue grace: from veteran veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relatives like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted as a professional. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention to ease mood whenever necessary. Dialogues ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with love!") To ilogic / monoton ("Pakistan zyada Muslim Hindusthan mein hain"). And the expletive syndrome of all MC, BC, Cs and F-words was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to offer a tribute to the brave Indian armies, but tries too hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
