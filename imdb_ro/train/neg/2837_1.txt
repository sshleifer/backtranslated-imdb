Derek's had a series of decent auctions in the 1980s to get the title of "the worst film of all time" and this is probably the most important achievement of these stakes. In fact, this movie can be seen as belonging to the "so bad, it's good" category, right there with the products of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman. This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film, with some top-ranked people. Anthony Quinn made the odd dodgy movie in his time, but this spectacle as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad to be seen to be believed.
