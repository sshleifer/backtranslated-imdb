I took this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what to write. I started the film and soon I was pulled into a world of pain and visual torture. what the hell is like. It's this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. He did not even have a plot. There were things that happen in every scene, but no general explanation of why something happens. Instead of looking at this movie, we suggest you align the nearest blender with oil and try to make as many bullets as you can. You will find that the result will be more enjoyable than this movie. You do not even follow him. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you follow him, he means he wins.
