Laugh, Clown Laugh, released in 1928, plays legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a lie (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to maturity and named Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in circus life, and she became a ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual performances, I have not managed to overcome the fact that Tito, now middle-aged, has the misfortune of the young Simonetta. Although she is not her biological father, she raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor enters the movie. These compete for Simonetta's affections with a "Count" Luigi (Nils Asther) young and beautiful. Simonetta falls clearly for the young man, but feels guilty of Tito's abandonment (loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous and it seems amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito what a fool he is (until he does not reveal it at the end). The film is noteworthy only thanks to Loretta Young, who will have an extraordinary career. While adoring Chaney's shine as an actor, all this movie seems amazing and even creepy.
