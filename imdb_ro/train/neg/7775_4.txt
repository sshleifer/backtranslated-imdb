I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but came to this movie last night on Showtime. The film looked very good with design and cinema, but the script was stomach and wood. The actor was bad enough - they thought the two women were working. You never thought about the actors who supported it. There were stereotypes - the Biblical Reverend - beaten, without any hint of hint, authoritarian captain, hotheaded soldier, etc. I'm sorry to say that, based on these deficiencies, I immediately turned it off as a Canadian without knowing it was so - Telefilm Canada's final credits have given it away. I know I'm a horrible person. Maybe we lost something at first, but hostility to girls is never explained. Here they are besieged in a herd of werewolves, and men spend time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There is a little more than a pressing situation beyond your walls unless these girls are lesbian or not - that's just my inference to hostility towards them. If I can target and shoot a gun, you'd better be nice to them. The question of "their immortal soul" can be solved later. Also, I think this concerns the rest of the trilogy, these girls should be the protagonists? One of them killed the Indian at the end, who saved his life. I think one is just a victim of her condition, which can not be blamed for her actions, but the other is just a killer who does not deserve her happy ending.
