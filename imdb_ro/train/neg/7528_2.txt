This is even worse than the original game of death. A pitiful and incoherent story leads to "Billy Lo" falling from a helicopter on the ground below, killing him, as we let our younger brother, Bobby Lo, follow. So, not only do we start with a Bruce Lee clone, the movie kills him and he's been watching for another third of the story. The main reason to follow this is when Bobby Lo struggles with a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the negative character, which is usually pretty awesome, but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly, they watched this and the original game of death because they are part of the boxed set Bruce Lee. No wonder they are included in Lee's work. No one could buy them otherwise.
