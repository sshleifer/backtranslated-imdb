I remember when I first saw this movie when I was in the sixth grade. Before seeing this, I listened to the original recording on Broadway and even liked it! But when I saw that, I was like, what the hell ?! This movie lacks a lot of musical songs to shout out loud! Who decided to do all this ?! I'm really a big fan of the Kelly gene, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical you've ever done! The film seemed rather a set in Hollywood than the beautiful lands of Scotland. And who the hell has decided to cut off all the songs of Meg in the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe were probably wondering: "Who in the world has decided to do this for our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they probably were upset that Hollywood turned its great music into a rather empty film. audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that lacks a lot of text. So, in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, it's not! <br /> <br /> 3/10
