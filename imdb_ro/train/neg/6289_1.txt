This is the most hidden and the worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is dignified and the two main actors - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very nasty and naive and should never have listened to Danny's false promises. Neve Campbell and the murderer of Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor film attempt. Danny (Dean Paras) looks at the age of thirty, and the little girl she's trying to sleep on - Corey looks like he's still in college. Here in Australia, this movie is called Too Smooth; there is nothing smooth about this movie at all. 1/10 Avoid
