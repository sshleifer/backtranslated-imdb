Okay, where do we start with this gem? The mutant muscles begin to take over a small town in New England (?). Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now if this was not ridiculous enough, stay tuned. Records of snails are what is known as movie. No matter who attacks the hammers or where they are, it is shown the same shot of bullets that shine everywhere. Keep in mind, this single shot takes at least half of the movie. The act in the movie was beaten, pulled out, stole your wallet, hit your girlfriend, killed your dog, BAD. I'm sure it's worse, but you'll find it hard to find him. The only jewel was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He probably did some night classes at YMCA, because he was the best in the group. How about horror? This movie should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They're babe to shout out loud. The whole growing action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Just look at this movie in an MST3K environment, otherwise I see some major brain damage.
