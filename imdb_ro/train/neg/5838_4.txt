With an absolutely amazing distribution and crew, this could have been a classic one. Instead, it is a repetitive paraphrase of all the conspiracy theories that exist in 1979 about the use of the JFK graft, rather unnecessarily, in a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious Kegan President in 1960. Many superb characters are wasted, with enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or be asked to go up the hill - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins are doing very well, in a very different way. The photo is superb, but it does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of buying the DVD.
