Wow ... I can not believe how bad is ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). I heard the rumors, I read the reviews - but I had to make my mind for me. Well, let me tell you - The worst action of any movie ever made, doubling that it must have been done while all the people involved were completely wasted, stupid and ridiculous by the FX, no disgraceful plot , "cinematography" that looks like my grandfather shot her with her room, no joke - made of sheet metal - the list goes on and on ... Three boys wander on an island where a bunch of weirdies are running with swords plastic and sheet metal. Two of the captives are released with a rebellion of the island's freaks and are given a start one day before being hunted by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's pretty much ... <br /> <br / > Honestly - this is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever had the misfortune of obeying me. The budget had to be about 200 dollars and it was spent entirely on the FX gore (which was not really a bad idea ...). Nothing is for ZOMBIE DOOM, other than ridiculous scenes, ridiculous, with lots of dialogues called HORRIBLY. This movie makes other excursions without budget, such as PREMIUM: THE LIFE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE looks like TITANIC. Some can rank the ZD in the "so bad is good" category and I think if you are really drunk or tall and watch with some friends the MST3K style - I think it could be looked this way. But not me. I hated almost everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is just as awful and is included as a "bonus" on the release of Shock-O-Rama of ZD) indicates other works by Andreas Schnaas - then he should be forbidden ever to do something by making a film again under the sanction of death. There's a funny kung-fu fight in the second half of the movie and a lot of blood - so I'm gonna give it a VERY generous 3/10 - Make a favor and jump over that.
