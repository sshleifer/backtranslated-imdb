Time is precious. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who take revenge on small movies like Fargo and this complete loss of time. The theater was packed and everyone remained with the same reaction: Is this the movie that critics want? What a crap! The hook of this film is the moving black daughter up, searching for and finding her white family of garbage. (Production of lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60-minute story. Characters are superficial and unintelligible. I was insulted that these people could not tell each other what was obvious to the public; the audience murmured on the screen what the next characters should say. I had more fun doing the laundry.
