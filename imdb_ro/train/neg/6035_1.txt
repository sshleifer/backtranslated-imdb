I really want to be able to give a negative vote because I think I just lost 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror film ever made on the film. the act was just terrible god, I mean REALLLYYYY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded as if it was written by ... I can not think of anything horrible enough to say. And in the "outside" and "inside" days it is believed that the events have gone on for a few days. Terribly acting, guided, written, etc., etc., all the way to gofer as lunch for everyone. REDUCE FROM THESE TO ALL COSTS. If my only saving grace to remain without hell is by doing a good deed, is to tell the world not to look at these crap. This movie is the reason why horror movies are not taken seriously.
