this film offers nothing but the worst possible conversations. as a matter of fact, I most likely could not have imagined how meaningless a movie, how synthetically the dialogues could be up to an hour ago, but then again, I saw this movie. In a movie that does not depend on a powerful script, expect to see which acts at least good and tasty conversations and even some humor can, but this film all over it is missing. you hear me missing all of it. there is not one point about this movie, none. I hate this. I'm sure anyone will do that. the name is meant to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and things, yet not even nudity. I do not know how, but I've had to watch this for an hour or so, and I certainly do not recommend this. the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. if someone offers you to forget it, say saaaaaave awaaaaay liiiiiiiiife you
