Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not offer the right chemistry here in this 1945 film. There is a good story about the Ax that is trying to get coal to be used in the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not underlined. Instead, we're dealing with a supposed Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. The true kudos act for Oscar winning veteran Katina Paxinou. As with his memorable memory, Pilar, in the 1943 Oscar winner "For Whom the Bell Tolls," Paxinou plays again a Spanish revolutionary, but this time he is a double crossover spy for the pro-Franco group . He's a pretty vicious figure, especially when he throws a 14-year-old kid out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child an important material to hide.
