Rumors say that when NASA's technical consultants for this film were asked to hold the credible image, they laughed for a few hours. After all, if you are not a politician or a work crew / transfer crew, you will not enter the shuttle. Additionally, Space Camp (Cadet) is in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is that everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events described in this movie ever become possible. This film was intended for children and had to be written by one because they are unaware of the countless restrictions and requirements for access to KSC / CCAFS. This is the most useless film of all time and it was a well-deserved flop.
