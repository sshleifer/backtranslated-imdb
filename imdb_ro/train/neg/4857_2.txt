I really liked ZB1. Indeed, I did. I have no problem with extremely low budget movies, and I enjoyed movies with lower production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, see "wiseguys vs. zombies" if you're interested). Indeed, I prefer smaller budget zombies, because I'm suspicious that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are "about." But ZB3 was just as bad. It was delayed. I do not want to bother to be worthy of my criticism. I want 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it really took only 80 minutes, because I did it in 1.4X before. <br /> <br /> Well, here are some criticisms. <br /> </ p> <p> 1. Pacing was TERIBLE. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when someone just had one line, the camera and editing and inserting a bunch of F bombs in each sentence made the FEEL line a monologue. At first I was delighted with the 90-minute running time compared to ZB1 for 70 minutes, but in ZB3 there were actually fewer "events". It all speaks. <br /> <br /> 2. The gore effects have become worse. Only the glop was rubbed by people's tumbles. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, it really was not a plot. And the exhibition is really epic! I will not hurt her if you follow her. (Do not look at him.) But then it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you choose.
