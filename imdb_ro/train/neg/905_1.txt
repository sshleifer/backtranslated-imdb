An unmarried woman called Stella (Bette Midler) gets pregnant with a rich man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her from a sense of obligation, but she turns him down and decides to raise the baby on her own. Things go well until the kid named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) get worse. I have seen both the silent version and the soundtrack of Stella Dallas. None of them affected me too much (and they are crying easily), but they were well done if they were dated. Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a bad idea. I think Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to get this done. This (predictable) has bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado are performing well, this movie is really shooting and I'm bored to the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help to support roles. Flimsy and boring. Indeed - who thought this would work? See Stanwyck version 1937. I gave this 1.
