From a visual point of view, this movie is amazing. He has some lovely moments of comedy. But, as a whole, the plot is very clich√©, as is its apparent message. If you are a fan of top violence in table movies such as boarding house or seen, you will love it. If you are looking for something at all the tall forehead, go away. I saw it at the edinburgh 06 film festival, and we chose it just because we were looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it is not disturbing. Just polished and unpleasant to stay by. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be extracting or telling your friends about a really confused film, then that's for you.
