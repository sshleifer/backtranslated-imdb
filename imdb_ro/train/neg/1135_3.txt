I have not read a Lincoln biography, so maybe that was a precise portrait ... And maybe because I'm used to the same alien and unrealistic worship portraits that unusually denigrate Lincoln is brilliant, honorable and savior of our country ... But why would he make a film to represent Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, portraying him as a "shucks aw, I'm just a simple guy" seemed a bit insulting. [It was granted, that was the Bushie Jr. campaign, to make us think it was "just an ordinary guy," so we would not care that it's a rich and privileged grave - but that's a whole story. ) Not only is the film showing Lincoln as a simple (almost simple) type, the film states that Lincoln has just accidentally entered the law and that he was not even interested in the law - just with the false idea of ​​the simplistic law of rights and mistakes. In the film, he is not a very good defense lawyer (he lies with his feet on the table and enjoys the witnesses) and the result is largely determined by chance / luck. In addition, partly because it was funded by Republicans (in response to a play sponsored by the Democrats who came out) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times, the film is, unfortunately, religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie!
