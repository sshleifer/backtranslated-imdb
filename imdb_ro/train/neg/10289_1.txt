This would really deserve an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this show through the ages, and the show jumped the shark around the 7th series. But this episode is proof that the show jumped the shark. It's written lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even garbage-like Beavis and Butthead. It is quite possible to be ridiculous and fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mummy, Count of Monte Cristo - all the "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is a ridiculous thing as in "This is the worst thing I have ever seen". And indeed, this is the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible, and that comes from someone with a star gate in her basement. It makes me want to sell all the props from the star gate, the most serious.
