These two points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood movies are not really trying to be realistic but YOU answer that a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. Father dies and does what any good parent does ... He gives it out to the son with his PREGNANT son. A few things that were too difficult to swallow - 1. Cool indoor pool in the "Priyanka" bedroom and going from that to life who was hungry in her garden in the garbage garden ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly obtained the job as a stuntman, was bitten by the injured dogs, then left. This movie is INSULT to our intelligence, I really can not believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who made this film, taking my family to see it, I left the cinema with a frown, please do not submit to this misery to see this it takes my advice and does not lose your life.
