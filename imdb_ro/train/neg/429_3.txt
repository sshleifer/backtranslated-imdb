I was lured to see this movie by its old power, but in the end it's all that it offers. It plays much more a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about the corruption of big cities. The biggest defect is the predictability and total lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are at the beginning, and just follow in the time they fall as a domino. The film, which he gives, refrains from violence and free sex, but forgot to replace in any other way a love, love or good emotion. All the flavor of a colla diet with well-desiccated diet. "Q & A," which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, just like "LA Confidential".
