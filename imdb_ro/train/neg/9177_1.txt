The House of the Dead was the worst cinematography I've ever seen, between the mournful attempts of the 360-channel "matrix chamber" and that of the cheeses, I fell asleep. I do not think the manager and the set manager could decide whether it would rain or not, because it would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would have rated this movie with 1 out of 10 (10 being the best, 1 being the worst). Also, the jumps on the scene from the movie to the game were very annoying, making you wonder if they only just lost time. I urge someone who reads this, not to see him. It's not worth the time.
