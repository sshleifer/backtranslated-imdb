Perhaps we lost the meeting when the meaning of the movie B was explained, but what we just saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good synopsis of this movie? Take strangers, replace Xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that's good about it, and that's pretty much. In 5 minutes in the movie, "the V-SAN team" (this is the worst acronym I've ever heard) checks a "base" that has been massacred by the vampires and then down (DOWN? What?) An apparently attached scale by a panel with an obvious daily train in the background. When is this supposed to happen? 2210. Okay ... (hold me, I'll go back to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. the characters. Wow, good Asian lesbian cubs, red cowboy, stray captain, goth vampire / Hot Topic and second commander. All of them are played by their actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost made me feel painful to see Micheal Ironside in this movie. Is not enough money like Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Pretty much the only original thing about Vampire Wars is how bad it is. Looking after this birth of a movie, the only fun I received was from the weak attempts to make the setting. Since the PCI cards have been recorded on the wall as a camera prepared on a ship? The money needed to make this film could have been much better.
