Yes, the only thing that this film is memorable is that he played a young Tom Hanks, who only a few years later would be a relevant star at Hollywood. Here, although it is not a film that will show no talent at all, and the only thing that might be considered somewhat fun about this movie is the scene where he thinks he sees a monster and drives a guy. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Actually, a special guy after school about the dangers of the Dungeons and Dragons that have cleverly reduced here, like Maze and Monsters. Apparently, the producers of this film believed that nerds should not have fun if they are not going to go out and drink alcohol, drugs, have a lot of unprotected sex, and harass other children less well than all the famous children. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually requires you to use the brain there, heaven does not! Not that if they have a brain, they might think of themselves and not be washed by certain groups there. Yes, I think this movie is absolutely stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are fewer people who have died in Dungeons and Dragons all the way through their lives than telling what drunken driving assumptions such as a month.
