God this movie was so boring in addition to the music I really loved, I want to say what was the purpose of actually making this movie, please anyone who reads this review not to watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act, but he was really pathetic In this film, I'm ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was really really bad. Celina is just a beautiful girl without any lack of talent, which could not act at all and it was useless to be in this movie, as for the other girl Radha, it was good that I think it could have done better good. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time. please buy great music and do not watch this movie.
