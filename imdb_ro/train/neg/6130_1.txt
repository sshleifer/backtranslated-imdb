In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in their post receive film roles that only exist to capitalize on this. I have no idea what was paid to Thomas to make this movie, but I should have paid a lot of money to agree to make me a national madman in me. The film is obviously derived from "Enter the Dragon," as well as most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art, they build a new absurd martial art, described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dance." A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is committed to saving a lady from an impenetrable fortress, yet each room has a support that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick assisted opponents. Of course, he is struggling along the way to the lead bastard and, of course, has a fantasy fight, with an end that will surprise only those who have never seen a martial arts movie. There are touches that some nostalgic types will want, especially Thomas's mullet and many of the male co-stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have an opinion against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he never put his foot on the film.
