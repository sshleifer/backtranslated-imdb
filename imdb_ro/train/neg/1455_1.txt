I have rarely been subjected to such absolute nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a movie, I crawled over time. Terrible, tribute, distorted and full of lies and halves of truth. Hitler's famous biographer, Ian Kershaw, was originally a consultant for this film. However, he found that the script was so inaccurate and ridiculous from a historical point of view that he refused, and also asked not to use his name as a source (he made him think that people would think he was involved). A scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loved animals over humans. He brought the strictest laws on animal welfare in Europe, banned animal vivisection and experimentation. He was also a vegetarian. The film transforms the win of the Iron Cross into a hoax that involves bribery. Utter lying. He was assigned to him for repeated acts of courage for a long time. There are no historical documents showing that Hitler has ever had a sexual relationship with his granddaughter. Not one. Besides, Hitler is portrayed as a simple fool in this garbage film. If he were half as ignorant, demented and thick as he is in this stupid film, as in real life, you would not even have known he ever existed. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was extremely terrible. Go downfall Downfall and give him a very wide place.
