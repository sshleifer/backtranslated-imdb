OK, but does not that make a good movie? Okay, not really, in my opinion. It is not a lot to recommend it. Found it very slowly, tediously, in fact. It is also predictable pretty much through and through. Number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not as much. I also felt that this movie was sometimes pretty camouflage, which I do not really think fit for this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main evil role at this rate. he's a rather decent actor, but I felt he played his character up too. I think it suits the tone of the movie, which would be great if I liked the movie. . Arnold Vosloo returns to the lead role, but has little to do in this movie. The character did not really evolve, as we hope. Okay .. that's just my opinion. Anyway, for me, while this movie is not terrible, it's pretty bad. I vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
