Cloud Wayward is a frustrating movie to watch. Scary enigmatic, treats each shot as a work of art. You have the impression that the composition of each fire has been designed and prepared with a special care that binds to obsession; Explaining how much cinematography has progressed since the first films were downgraded in the nineteenth century and they imitated their construction, the room never moves? except camp time and colored musical numbers. Ambient noise is kept to a minimum and only a word is spoken. This strange but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention on visual stimuli only so that, even if the story progresses in a snail's rhythm, we feel stuck. Unfortunately, at least for me, this dive begins to unleash somewhere around the hour. I began to feel like the movie caused me to watch as it became more difficult as the minutes were drawn, so the mere act of watching became a battle of will. If the content of this film was not as sexual as it would undoubtedly have been more obscure for the Western audience. As it is, there is an abundance of feminine nudity and an act of sexual abuse on an unconscious (or possibly dead) woman who is so repulsive that even though she can talk about the amount of degradation to which pornography is subject to both men and women and used) is so zealous in the way he chooses to make his point of view so as to make it ineffective. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participants of the explosion in the pornographic content available will look for this movie for all the wrong reasons and will follow with the sticky finger on the quick button of the remote. For all his problems, the movie is definitely a passenger, and the more you think about it, the more you feel certain aspects of his seem to do. Ironically, for a movie that happens so little, the spectator would probably be rewarded proportionally for a second or even third time. For me, however, once was that enough?
