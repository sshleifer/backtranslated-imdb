It was a decent film, actually I liked it. But the end is so steep! There is absolutely no closing and leaving tons of free heads. What happens after the concert? What's wrong with her boyfriend? Is it about Grant? Does he have any trace in the next semester? And Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance will hit Angela in a few hooks, but nothing is reported about how he reacts. There are so many left in the air and they are very unsatisfactory. I do not know if he's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think this really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
