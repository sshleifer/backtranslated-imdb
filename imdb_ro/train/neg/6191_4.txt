I watched this film, along with any other adaptation I could take my hands, including tracking songs - in the preparation of academic research. Cinema is very moving, just like music. Unfortunately, all life has been taken out of the story. I've never seen such a dreadful representation of Mr. Rochester. All its most fundamental features have disappeared. Where is his wisdom? Where is his passion? Rochester's Scott looks more like Rochester's film, St. John, than with the Roman character. In fact, the actor who plays St. John in this adaptation played a passionate St. John, while Scott is pleased to crush things or just look at the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this film a slightly larger vote based on wonderful music and cinema, but I can not honestly support this film for too long due to the performance of George C. Scott.
