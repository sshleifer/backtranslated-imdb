I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to get started, was still disappointed. The most flagrant mistake in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot of plot (the guy who woke up during surgery) had nothing to do with the result. It would have ended in the same way indifferent. So what was the purpose of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and did not think people would ask if a patient died on his table? Save me. Jessica Alba is completely talented and Christiansen is almost as bad. Everything was just ridiculous from start to finish. I'm pretty sure that if you could feel that someone was cutting through your chest with a scalpel, it would be more pain than that.
