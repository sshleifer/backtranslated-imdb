How has this film ever been distributed on behalf of all the saints? Apparently, he was shot on someone's cell phone and screamed the victim's screaming face at new depths. They literally shout for the 90 minutes of the film. And that's all I do. There is no plot, no tension, no character, not a lot of acting. Just screaming and screaming. I gave up after fifteen minutes and hurt him quickly to see if something happened. No - except for screaming, of course. Pretty bold, the act of going through it in front of before highlighting another problem - there is no room to talk about. Every shot looks like any other shot - the middle distance, an angle, boring, boring, DULL. It's not so bad that it's okay. It's simply bad.
