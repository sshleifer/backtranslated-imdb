Although the film for this movie was admirable, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this movie be watched. My wife and I decided that the reason I followed the whole movie was that it was like a train wreck and it was almost impossible to return. It may have been that we "hoped" that the message would eventually become obvious and that we would be able to grasp a significance of this effort. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Of course, the audience could have "made sense" of this complicated story, a credit for the ingenuity of the human brain to understand the absurd. However, the writers have done nothing to facilitate this innate need that we seem to have for finding meaning. It was obvious that those involved simply had movements of their respective crafts and that any inherent passion because the characters or the story were secondary or non-existent. Unfortunately, films made for television seemed to go through the years. While communicating a message to the public could have been the primary interest of writers in the past, contemporary writers and producers seem to be condescending to their audience, focusing primarily on our manipulation of "staying" through incessant advertising that seems to be be the only reason why movies such as Surrender, Dorothy are being made.
