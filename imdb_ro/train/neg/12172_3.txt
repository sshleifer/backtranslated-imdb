After the disaster of the first Sleepaway Camp, who believed that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in appearance. Crime more inspired and more fun. While this can not be said too much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II deserves to rent. Professionals: Entertainment, do not take too seriously as SC I. Killings Inspired. Against: Crappy acts and mullets abound. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
