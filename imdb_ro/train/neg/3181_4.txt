This movie was not made by Who's fans. Most wonderful moments that fans will look forward to doing in half an hour, Tommy, are simply lost or taken into account: In Christmas, they did not show Daltry's sparks after the line "Tommy does not know what day is .. ", they showed almost nothing * no * Townsend guitar photos in the Pinball Wizard, there were excesses of lots of photos in the best moments from Go to the mirror, and worst of all, in the second half of the year we will not take it for you), we robbed almost every flash of Pete's guitar hit. Several pieces of the film are shot behind the band. It's a very frustrating film to watch and does not deliver the goods. I do not know if director Murray Lerner is just a fan Who, or worse, at least for him, if he * is * fan of the fans and all these * 8 rooms * could take them. To agree, there are rare numbers in front of Tommy, as well as some fantasies that are very well shot, and sometimes editing is brilliant. This might be enough to make some spectators happy, as long as you do not anticipate Tommy. The overall sound was mediocre in the broadcast I watched from DirecTV; it may be different on video or DVD.
