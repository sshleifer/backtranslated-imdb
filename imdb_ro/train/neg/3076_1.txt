This movie should only be watched if you try to kill yourself. I think this movie could cause serious brain damage. The main characters are Kevin, Amy, his brave friend, conservative mistress, Kyle, a dork in red shorts enjoying sex on the phone, Daphne, a grumpy and excited girl who should be "cool" and does not have the feeling to dress, and her exaggerated friend Nick, an army recruiter who can make a hint of anything. No, I'm not a perverse, that's just how the movie works. The film itself is a 1986 Gremlins rip-off, just that you will never find a trace of Gizmo. No, these Hobboblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make one's wildest dreams come true and then kill the victims. Yeah, you guessed-Finally, they end up in a strip club, where Amy's biggest dream is revealed - He wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie through MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot making a laugh at this cinematic work and still bleeding from both eyes. Not really, but I would have liked it. I'm not giving you anymore a plot, because I give it so hard I have to drive a fork through my brain. In addition, it is not like a plot worth mentioning. He should put a surgeon's general warning on this movie.
