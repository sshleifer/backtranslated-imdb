Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know something about Japanese culture and little about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm Spanish, I'm eating paella and I like black humor. Okay, with that fixed point, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how nice it is Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a pretty good director - despite Talking Head's style too pedagogical, and even it was curious and somewhat interesting - and I'm surprised she came up with it. Perhaps it is one of those cases lost in translation, I'm afraid it is, but as a European spectator watching the film with thin subtitled subtitles, I thought it was horrible. The banks seemed sorry, the script was overwhelmed-I mean, give the audience a pause and shut up a little damn narrator-almost to make my head explode in an excess of speechless and absurd action. br /> <br /> However, I thought the animation was really good. The idea is wonderful and is well exploited in those animated scenes. However, candy ends as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless, not funny, speech at all the mumbo-jumbo words on the photos. It just makes you want to move on to the next scene of hysterical cropping characters. I read that Mamoru Oshii is actually planning a continuation of this. The idea was good but horribly exploited. Perhaps the second part will reveal the good parts of this first film and will actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more a scene. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Gifters for fast food will cause you a stroke. Of course, this commentary is based on the experiences of a European man. Probably this is useless for the Japanese people, maybe it was a very funny film lost in the cultural and translational borders. May be.
