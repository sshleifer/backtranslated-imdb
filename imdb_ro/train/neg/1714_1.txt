Once again a classic movie has been remodeled useless, with predictable disastrous results. The title is fake, like everything about this movie. The period is not convincing and the leaders seem too young and too vague to be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view and was made by talented people. Even though the 1967 version did not exist, this would still be a useless movie. The 1967 version deviated from the facts, presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was interesting and innovative for 1967 and had some remarkable performances that allowed you to take care. This remake of 1992 seems to be removed from the original movie, rather than the truth, as is known, and the actors in this version are called, unattainable and not very interesting. Despite all this, skip this and hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it be worse?
