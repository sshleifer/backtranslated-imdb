I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - the others being THE WIFE for Christmas and JACK FROST. All three movies are about death. If you like to be completely depressed, then by all means, watch this movie or any other. In this movie, the actor is good and some of the scenes (unless people die) are wonderful. But, I'm worried that a clinically depressed person could accidentally see the movie and make themselves alone! Despite a "happy ever after" ending, most of this film is a terrible disaster after another. And, for some crazy reason, I do not want to be dispossessed when watching a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy people - after all, do not shake your eyes and you do not feel miserable, what the holidays mean For an experience of watch your home for the HOUSE WITHOUT A TREE Christmas, George C. Scott's Christmas Carol or Christmas STORY - if of course you do not like being miserable.
