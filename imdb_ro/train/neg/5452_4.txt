As far as movies are concerned, this is quite pleasant. Various characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I would have really liked it would not have been very irritated while watching the lack of absolute respect, showing the city they are in. Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except for Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents are only gradually heard in jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a spectator who likes her real-life movies to be more like real life), I really do not think it hurt to use any of the many talented Scottish actors ... or the little have taken English that could throw a decent accent! The unnecessary attempt to use the word "wee" a few times did nothing but continue insulting.
