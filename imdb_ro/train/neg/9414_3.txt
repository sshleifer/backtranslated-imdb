In spite of the appreciation on the DVD cover of the version I have borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is more realistic than other war films of the mud season, boredom and frustration of the tomb, but unfortunately one moves away from thinking that it is all about this film. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not that a good war movie needs to have a fight scene every five minutes. One of the best movies in the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has very few actions. But it compensates for dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The Story of GI Joe" is a short battle segment (titled "under the siege" on DVD) taking place in Italy. Of course, it is one of the fastest and most compelling scenes of fighting any war movie. But, unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth watching just for this climax. Another stop is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is meant to be a "romeo," but comes from a pervert. By contrast, Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic man if he is wrong. As he tells Capt. Walker (Mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer ... to the house." But the last step? a too many patrol? He leads him along the mental edge. It's a shame that the rest of the movie does not do justice to otherwise fine touches. As for Meredith's Pyle's portrait ... he's practically in a coma.
