Over the years, I've seen a bunch of Segal movies straight on the video and each has the same amount of entertainment; unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Sure, the sequences of action were fun, but that was quite a lot. Seagal was really at the forefront when he made movies like; During Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least in terms of the point of view of the action), but over the last ten years, these types of films that interpret Segal really do not correspond to their previous qualifications. the more positive side, the film has made good use of time, such as a part of the action sequences and the use of spirit. Even when the movie seemed to shoot, a pretty cool action scene brought her out of the trough. I honestly believe that Segal's more films would do better if he were not the only one fans admit to in the film. Actors and actress actors are a very important thing, and if their current films had these known actors and actresses, maybe the film will get more popular results.
