Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was done. The whole plot refers to someone who is trying to sabotage the superbe and to all the attempts to stop them. Tom Selleck and Donna Mills's careers have survived this is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing about this has NEVER been FOOTBALL IN ALL WINS! Avoid this if possible.
