Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of friends in his family's forest cabin for a Halloween party. While playing a game in which guests confess and face the worst fears ... Mike tries to call his father's spirit late. Soon it was discovered that Morty's spirit lives in a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath starts. <br /> <br /> Most of the F / X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. An everlasting story acted with pity. The members of the film are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Chief-Moon of Byron and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
