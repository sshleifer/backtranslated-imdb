One Question: Why? First of all, the premise is not funny or not at all attractive. They use recorded interviews and take the sound to animate with the animals talking to the parties. First of all, the interviews are not fun or entertaining to start with, and even if it were, I'm sure it would be much more fun to be looked at as they were originally without being turned into cartoons. How does that add a curse to that? I have activated the series of CBS sitcoms, which has become regular for me to relax after the stressful working days on Monday and I found this. Of course, the sitcom component would be resumed anyway, being summer, but seeing these episodes were more fun. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I did. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it would be funny. Not. And then he went on. It was half an hour long. And I almost see if there is a goal, if the interviews were shown in full and they had points for them. But no, they were clips in one line, cut and glued together very quickly. It was like a horrible, terrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken". I was not a fan of the CBS sitcom, canceled now, "Class". Since when it was, it was half an hour of the fight I'm going to fight. But if it came to me to decide a whole season of those three or more episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say I would take the "Class". Given that it's been a couple of hours since they've been running and I've come to see that I'm the first to comment ... I think it's a good sign that no one has followed it and it will not take much longer. Cartoon cartoons.
