Very re-edited and often confusing, the original version of Man On Fire remained at least ten years old when it was made, and the past few years did not do better. This is a kind of film that producers with too much money and little experience do to attract the attention and everyone else just to pay their pensions or drug distributors, with Scott Glenn's bodyguard who comes out for a member for to save her 12-year-old, kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - did everything better, the action is slow and low, and only John Scott's exceptional score (part of which appeared in Die Hard's last drum) positive. A case in which the remake (made by Tony Scott, the director's initial choice for this release) is an improvement.
