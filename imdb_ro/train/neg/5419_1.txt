Why do filmmakers always oppose the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed by the viewer's interest, but look at Anne de Green Gables. They have done a wonderful job of combining important events into a whole cohesive that was simply delightful. I can not believe they chose to combine three novels together for Anne de Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Look at everything they missed doing this. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, windbreaks. . . and the years of Anne's college, for God's sake! Would not you have been delighted to meet Priscilla and the rest of the band in Redmond? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things to a movie at a time, instead of kissing them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good if you let the novels out of it! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was disappointed after seeing how he managed to make Brough Anne's life at Green Gables.
