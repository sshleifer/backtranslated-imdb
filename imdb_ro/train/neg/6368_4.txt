This is the last time I hired a video without recording IMDB ratings. Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote the Nightwatch script with Ewan MacGregor and directed such garbage as Out of Sight with Jennifer Lopez's anti-talented. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a pity he got involved in such a bad movie. There is a frequent confusion, which seems to be a last-minute decision, to compensate for lack or story, filming and normal sense. This movie is all wrong. What did they think?
