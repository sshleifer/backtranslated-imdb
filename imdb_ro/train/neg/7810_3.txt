Against All Hope is a very bad movie, sometimes painful. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and shows, he's not so good at it. Some people might find the ridiculous story; an alcoholic realizes that life and family are falling apart so that he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. After telling the story to the preacher, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> I found many of the religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church but moves away from her, quite realistic. I also liked the way Cecil knows that his life breaks and tries to help but realizes that only God can help. At the end of his life, he could, with the help of God, go through life without drinking again. This movie is not doing well at all. The act is bad, the script could use something and look worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you can automatically stop your addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on the right track. Generally, if your Christian will appreciate how this film describes Christianity and if you are not, you can be summoned to learn more about the faith.
