this could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not see how this could ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller? more like a wood drama. scary music is EXCELLENT, but since there were no frightening situations, the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for day-to-day activities like a garbage pit or a staircase. the movie had so much potential. they had a beautiful cinema (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed like the writers assume you already know them. they would have been subjected to specific activities without explanation or even indication of what they meant. this is simply one of those films that tells him about one thing and it's completely different.
