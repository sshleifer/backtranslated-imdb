Long-lasting drama that is not capable of making any real points. So she became an actress - so what? Taught to love - a big deal. There is some eccentricity between characters and in dialogue and situations, but the guy who is bad for the movie, often causing it seems absurd. Phoenix Summer, playing the role, discussions and behaviors as a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the film as a retarded girl who does it in the theater world - which was not clearly the point. We are told in time (in that story, "Barry Lyndon") that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone, but the film suffers for her. She is practicing a walk like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not quite credible given the lack of emotion. Occasionally, the movie had that sleepy and sleepy feeling of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it one? I would not be surprised at all. Phoenix Summer is the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the Phoenix River. Nepotism rarely works.
