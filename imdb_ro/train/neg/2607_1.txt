I have recently watched the movie and look bad with the book on which it is based. I blame this scenario and bad direction. Some parts have been forced into force (the scene of homosexual rape) for no apparent reason. Actually, I read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. It was hard for me to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all ... other than sensational parts for time. As it refers to things considered "sensitive," at least, during communism, I see the fascination it produced at the time. This is no longer the case now, but maybe I can see things differently now or a little from both of them. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book, the result being a combination of scenes that can make sense to someone who reads the book. Even so, it's a difficult film to watch and maybe it should never have done.
