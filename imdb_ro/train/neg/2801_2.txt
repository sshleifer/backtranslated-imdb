After a quasi-gothic, fruitful music video, the movie begins with Cassidy, the singer who is killed. In a perfect world, which would be the end credits, it would turn. We do not live in that world. The members of the insipid band decide to go to a clown to contact her dead essence. When I say clown, I mean the current clown. He tells them all will die through Cassidy's ghost (the spirit possesses Dora, one of his bandmates). We could not care less that the characters are boring, vapid and extremely horrible. Written by Adam Hackbarth (an incredibly great name if ever) and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who, after The attendant, and the Blood Tower, must know that he continues to do nonsense for a living), this film is a a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the spectator's need to stay awake. There is not enough blood to quench the hen's lines, or enough nudity to meet the perverts. This movie, in fact, has absolutely nothing to recommend anyone. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F Candy Eye: Amanda Carraway gets topless to see her: Starz on Demand
