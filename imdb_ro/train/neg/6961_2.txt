I completely agree with the other comment that somebody should make a Lily Tiger with this movie. It has to be one of the worst French films I have seen for a long time (in fact, along with Brotherwood in Lupi, 2 terrible movies in a much too short period of time). It is very sad because the distribution is very interesting and the original idea is a kind of fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my dear ones, I was bitterly disappointed to see compromise in such a poor film. Lou Doyon is pretty bad, as usual, which leads to proving that a beautiful face and famous parents can bring you in movies, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you want to laugh watch Alain Chabat in place or a piece of fun time LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
