There is only one use for a movie, such as Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad it can be. We often see movies that we describe as "terrible" or "not good," but then you meet a movie like this and you can see that although all the other movies are not "good" they are not even faded bad as bulletproof. It was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds through the DVD store at our local store to fulfill an obligation (that is, to give me a gift). It could have been a seventh discovery, but it was not: this is so completely clich√©, so badly written, so badly condemned that it was so bad that we surprised that all those involved were not arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I've been watching as much as about 30 seconds, but I've continued, because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad they can be enjoyable. This is not one of them. It's simply bad. I stopped after 45 minutes and tomorrow I'll throw her into the trash.
