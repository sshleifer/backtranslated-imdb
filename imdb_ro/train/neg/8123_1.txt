(spoilers) Wow, this is a bad one. I did a double take when I saw an old Star Trek episode the next day - it was the one in which everyone is infected with that space illness and then goes a bit mad - and there was Stewart Moss, aka the "hero" inappropriate of It Lives at night! He played the first infected crew member who died of terminal depression. All I could think was watching his own movie too many times, that caused depression. This movie is full of really unthinkable people. There is no redeeming character in the movie, not one. It's very hard to feel sorry for Dr. Beck turning into a bat (or whatever has actually turned) because he just does not like it. And you do not like his strident, bony, or foolish Sgt. Ward or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest any moment or energy in this movie? If there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to disturb you. Not to mention the horrible cinema, which made it look like they shot the film through the urine and the special effects of five cents, many of which seemed to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate the hordes of bat flying. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but there, in the bottom ranks, for sure.
