Terrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has a bad monkey IQ. What a disaster. I could not believe how bad this movie is. Dialogues are just very strange and outside the subject, the camera sometimes works even horrible, music at times as a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I watched this movie to see how much worse it may have. Some of the side strike actors are total disaster. Sister, but all my fingers, toes and anything that can hang down on my body fall on the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but he knows maybe he's in a financial crisis to assume his role in such a fiasco movie. . . . . this film should have been presented to all students in all film schools just to teach them a lesson about how to not make a movie
