This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Simply. How can someone develop a relationship with the heroine or have empathy for her is beyond me. I felt I was looking at a history case of a schizoid individual with a personality disorder. Just terrible. In the most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce and create "film" - except that I could not find an art for my life. If this woman lived in the world of today, she would have been taken to a mental institution and would have been given antipsychotic medication for a few days. This, or simply allowed to walk the streets and become a woman's bag. Why other characters in this movie have found something redeeming in her - and tried to help her in her attempt to become an actress - speaks more about their pathology than any convincing features they have done that they have deserved this effort.
