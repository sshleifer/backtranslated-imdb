Haunted Boat sells like "The Fog" meets "Open Water". In many respects, this is correct. There are strange scarecrows and strangers looking to keep you interested. However, the ability to act is poor at best. Show clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends who make a horror movie. Which in all the credits that I do as well as possible. When you accept the low budget, it is very difficult for special effects, with ghosts that look pretty much like men with rubber masks. Many aspects of the movie are horrible and weird. But it suffers for too many overturnings and transformations in a short time that leaves you bored and confused. As far as waking up, the movie does very well. If you ignore irrelevant twist every 5 seconds near the end, you want to know what's going on. And they are willing to wait 1 hour 35 minutes for the climax. This is not a ghost ship, but it will definitely do for a night in front of T.V.
