Not too impressed. It is difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and there, as if he saw the dry paint. The acting seems very poor, and reminds me of the old Maoist-era films, in black and white, occasionally featured on Chinese television. Although this is difficult to say with the female role, Yuwen, because the story seems to require only a ride like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of a glowing star Gong Li, who has gained a reputation as a good actress in the West because she has been perverse on her face all the time. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's "Blue Kite" movie was a much better film. But do not be fooled by the fact that the spring in a small town was established in the late 1940s. Unlike "Blue Kite," the fact that this movie is in a period of overflow is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a picturesque backdrop. I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to walk on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and turn to a foreign audience who can not tell the difference between a "deep" or "hypnotic" movie that is pure simply tiring and insubstantial. If any movie matches the description of "overestimation", it is. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the film industry in China.
