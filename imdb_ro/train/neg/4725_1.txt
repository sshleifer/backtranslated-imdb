A great opportunity for and director Indy to make an interesting movie about a rock musician on the edge of the stardom. It could have been a decent film if he had faced John Livien's traumatic past and tortured his psyche. Instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. The hero of John Livien's suicide mother was John Lennon, and she wanted him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical sparkle and his wonderful ability to teach others to learn about their lives, he showed that Lennon's legacy is that of a confused drug-dependent soul who should to see God as man instead. I'm a huge fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of another "crazy person" obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally killed by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we have to remember that? John Lennon has given so much to the world with music and honesty, and I was refused to see another troubled person as the lead character in this film, obsessed with Lennon, and not show him his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono kindly honored John Lennon's memory, making the Central Park memorial to give fans the chance to respect and remember John. Instead, the director of this film chose to use the site to try the killer to commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful of Lennon's memory. He was a peacemaker who died in a brutal and senseless death and saw such violence near this place felt as a revival of a terrible injury to any Lennon fan. He destroyed the movie for me. It could have been a decent film, but it gave me a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not remember his vicious murder of this irresponsible movie.
