The adaptation of Stephen King (the scenario of the King himself) in which a young family, new to rural Maine, finds out about the pet cemetery close to home. Father (Dale Midkiff) then discovers Micmac's burial beyond the pet cemetery, which has powers of resurrection - only what is buried, of course, is not right. start unhappy, insulting and inept and continue for a while, the worst absolute element being Midkiff's worthless performance. It gets a little better towards the end, with a really disturbing ending. Actually, the whole movie is really disturbing, so I can not completely reject it - even though I DO NOT know it makes it memorable. Fred Gwynne's prowling protagonists, as a neighbor's neighbor neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, as deafened spirit Victor Pascow, are not enough to really redeem the movie. The King acts as a minister. <br /> <br /> Followed by a sequel also directed by Mary Lambert (is it surprising she has not had any mainstream movie work since then?).
