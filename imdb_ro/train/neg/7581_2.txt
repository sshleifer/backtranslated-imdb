I saw this movie the next day in a movie school class and I had not seen an Almodovar movie before, but expect to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a useless film, with only a few laughs mixed with two hours of boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that could have gotten into their own separate films but together they do not add up to any significant content. Or so I thought. Then the next day, my film professor spent the entire classroom, explaining all the hidden details of the movie, such as how the mural exhibiting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the backdrop of the Queen's scene is kind of a comment on the lack of identity Spain, as a nation, developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is full of visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good movie - you have to give the audience a reason to keep your attention, something that would interest the spectator enough to care for all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives strange characters out of the rhythm, but keeps them in most of the worldly recycled situations in other movies, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to make any point. What is the significance, for example, of the revelation of the Hitchcockian surprise character appearing at the end of the movie? Why is it right there? Just to surprise us? There is a funny scene related to a news show. And that's the only fun moment. The rest of the film is just nonsensical film references and visual landmarks that apparently only exist to show us how intelligent Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than a self-indulgent trick for a movie to be good.
