Camp Blood III is a vast improvement in Camp Blood II because it sounds mostly in the right places and a rude plot. This time they ventured a bit further from the parking lot, the other two films were filmed, in which it is a good move, because you can not hear the cars that lead in the past what should be a remote wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time there is a real TV show and a fake clown to scare competitors. This is hardly a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror movies, with exactly the same premise as the true murderer returns, but at least he has a plot instead of people who were randomly stabbed a knife. > <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, it is at least good for a few laughs. I liked the effect of throwing fire when someone was stabbed early and how the mike boom was behind people as a ghost. I do not know why anyone would like to make the third Camp Blood movie, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they tried with it. The half-naked woman was a bit too much for me, apparently trying to maintain continuity by hiring a freak to get her clothes off with $ 5 just like in the second movie. They have not yet realized that a machete is used to cut off stabs, but oh well, is a Camp Blood movie what do you expect? If you like silly movies, you'll have fun with it.
