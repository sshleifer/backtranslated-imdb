Do you want to know a Secret? This movie sucks. Well, actually, I do not know, because if you let yourself be spoiled by the plagiarized versions of original movies, then you'll probably find this movie amazing (this movie being a plagiarized copy, I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the film are based on a typical story; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers who enjoy their vacation in Florida and themselves, behaving a lot like the young ones who are. The only perspective we have at this moment is the extent to which the director has managed to illustrate a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half-hour of the film has a small impulse and begins to illustrate a start in the face of unprecedented unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the film will certainly remain a mystery to me because I stopped it before I could still deceive myself to think that the movie might still have something interesting and original left to be show. As for the story, it can be easily explained on several occasions. A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While dealing with parties, slowly (and a little) they begin to be killed because they know a stupid secret. The only problem with murders is that all victims have been enrolled in a common high school. One thing that amazed me all about this movie was how much Betty (I'm not sure about her name .. the blond character), looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from the chair several times. Does he make a work of art? absolutely not because my 12-year-old granddaughter made me drink a glass of orange juice because she "stuck" me when I had to pass through the door of the guest room .. what difference between the director and my niece of 12 years ???? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure of you, but I do not ...
