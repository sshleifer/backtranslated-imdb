This movie was a pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x-minutes, I was wondering when the movie would begin. All settings were in place; the story of typical love, characters have to overcome their short-handed gift, the villain must appear, but none has ever begun. Until these things happened, I was already bored and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required tremendous tension and accumulation, it felt like necessary frames had been cut. The child's problems should not be so. Children's films can be so fierce and engaging as adults. The excuse, "hey, for kids," is a bull. I'll take the "Sword in stone" every day. It was terrible. I have the feeling that Disney will get something out these days. And for the kids, the 10 years I've seen with this will agree ... pure garbage.
