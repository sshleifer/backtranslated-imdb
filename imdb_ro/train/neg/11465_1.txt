Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst images I've ever paid to see - the type of movie you choose desperately at the mall's cinema during a Christmas holiday when you've lost the start-up times for something good, but still they are dead set to watch a movie! And that's how I came to see this smelling bomb ... At a distance from the best part of the three decades still smell the smell of rotting fish that make up this line of story. An awesome plot - that a killer whale is a prey to an individual not to the sea - is ridiculous. And that's all, except for a completely "out of place" theme that plays over the finishing of a love-free movie. At least Charlotte Rampling is awesome (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just chews the landscape. It was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not "jaws". Fortunately, I've eliminated my majority, and when I overtake it on television, I'm moving right away. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See t.v. ("Orca - I like Orca ...") - at least it ends in sixty seconds. This movement represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never come back again.
