This is an attempt, both by author Edgar Rice Burroughs, and by directors, to an Arab "Tarzan of the Monkeys." But this desert-set movie does not even show the magnificence present in Burroughs's adventure, more successful in the jungle. Emphasis is placed on the love of the noble Englishman Jon Hall (as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic beauty of the Arabs Kathleen Burke ("Princess" Eulilah), with the vengeance that happens to coincide with their desire to fuse. The opening affirms that, although guilty of unsuccessful behavior, the boy's mother lives - but she never reappears the image. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated and it seems that the video is missing. *** Leul Man (1936) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
