We anticipated the release of the movie as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I've been waiting and I've been reading months of award-winning reviews. I mean with the stars of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie can not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the advertising that was offered, and the only rescue harms were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saves the movie even when it hits multiple replicas, and Jennifer Hudson's performance forces you to pay attention every time it's on the screen. Her performance of "And I Tell You" was the only time I felt the hype was worth it. You came back as she did not ask any good man to let her sit in the group and in her life. As many commentators have said, she steals the film from more experienced actors and deserves all the distinctions she receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedy talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, traveled through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to be preceded by his extraordinary "Ray" show, and Beyonce Knowles was in a long-lasting film or video, showing and shining through the film. Her performance was not strong enough to make you care about her character at any time in the movie. The movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "heart" soloist Jamie Foxx) too much. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
