The plan sounded as if it were promised. To be honest I did not look at the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie, I had to make a decision. Is the movie deserved to be watched until it's over? The answer was clear NO! It was not that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Neither the premise that it was followed by secret government authorities for a human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written, acting unmolested, and I did not understand a few dream sequences with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a pack of dogs and leaving them in front of the zoo gate, the saying "If you can not run with the big dogs do not leave the porch" continues to go through my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that if you dare to look at her, you will stay there when you have not been lazy as I wondered why someone wasted money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting indignation of cinema US.
