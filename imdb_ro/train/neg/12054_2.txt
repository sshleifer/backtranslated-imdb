"What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if asking the question, they are morally graduated from what will eventually happen. The creators of the movie "Reversing Luck" try to make their voyeuristic chicks, hiding their antics as a sort of socially responsible experience. I'm taking Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and giving him $ 100,000 to see if he returns his life. Then, with only the most grim guidance and counseling, they let him go on his cheerful journey. What is she trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or what do you say, "Raise a man upward - it's more fun to watch him fall out of a higher altitude." They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, then they watched him throw it all over. Should it be entertainment? I'm dressing him up with some ghastly music and dramatic pictures, but he's got the high moral ground of car accident videos - just this time they gave birth to the cars and they asked, "What happens when you make a stop sign? "
