At least the places in the theater were comfortable, and I ate maize maize as hard as possible to drown down the inferior dialogue. This is not absolutely a girls movie. Any blocks that I like are the ones we, ladies, can provide. The bad story, the mediocre dialogue and a cheap film movie. I have seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the evil category. If you happen to see, the only thing you're looking forward to is the end. So, finally, you can get out of the theater as fast as you can.
