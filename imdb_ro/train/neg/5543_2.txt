Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but I just watched this for the first time last night, and it easily fit into the bottom of five of all time. Had to be about the love story or the zombies ??? This movie was so bad that after he had pardoned everything I could do is laugh at how ridiculous he was really. Fortunately, I'm too anal to disable the movie without seeing it all, or I could not boast of that until one session! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so according to this theory I will recognize the most positive asset of this film, it was very short for a feature film.
