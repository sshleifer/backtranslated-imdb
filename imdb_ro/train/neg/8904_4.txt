I really liked the "Prophecy" in 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even if the movie was not perfect, it was a terrible and very original Horror / Fantasy film that was very entertaining. This lower follow-up since 1998 is still worth watching, but mainly because of Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and is once again remarkable in the role of archangel Gabriel fallen, which he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between the fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russell Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, "Prophecy II", unfortunately, includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. Valerie's character was quite annoying, and Danayel upset me even more. The biggest pain in the ass was, however, the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who was not silent. However, Walken's performance is not the only quality of the movie's redemption. The whole movie is pretty awful and well shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The stage of Gabriel's resurrection at the beginning is, in addition, quite impressive and one of the most beautiful moments in the films "Prophecy". "Prophecy II" is still the poorest of the three "Prophecy" movies with Walken. Surely a one-man show Christopher Walken, fun, but nothing beyond that.
