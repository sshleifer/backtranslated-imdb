if you did not live in the 90s or you never heard the rapper! this movie might be OK for you but anything for any fan or anyone who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and did not have any point in the movie where i said it's interesting or did not know to stay. another thing that bothered me was that it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no fight he made prison easy looking, selling drugs, and even rapping was not realistic. I think if the movie, released in about 15 years now, could have more impact, maybe! good rap movies and agitation, enrich or die trying not to be notorious
