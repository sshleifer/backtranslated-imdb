Filmmaking: excellent, beautiful camera angles (I do not remember seeing a late film with good close-up photos until it). He could have avoided terrible scenes with a soft room. NY is photographed well. He liked the angles with his head down, especially (a different touch). Music: Not impressive. The songs are not in mind even after watching the movie. Perhaps, I expected the same quality as Anniyan. A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly withdraw from hard core action sequences. His age and belly really appear. He should also avoid romantic sequences close before. It was very strange to see a mature / old star who still tries to play as a scene of 20 heroes. Love can be expressed at any age; as you get old, you can still love your love remotely (without touching a woman too, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). Jyotika appears only for the same name in the movie. You are not sure why he accepted this. Well, that's not my problem, I guess. Others have only a small presence. Direction: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure) the film "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. It took a long time to release the film due to various issues. He escapes in several scenes. Even abusive things have slipped from a famous director. Overall: just a good movie. Too much graphics. DEFINITION not for children (and adults who expect some kind of "Entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
