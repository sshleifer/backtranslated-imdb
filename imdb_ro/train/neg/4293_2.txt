"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster being the main players. Even they can not save this complete melody. First of all, Hepburn is a horrible chase as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, she can not even shoot. She is too strong to be credible as a very simple thing and was too old for this part. Lancaster works to the end, and Earl Holliman is too strange and departed more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and Wendell Corey, who turn out to be entrusted, appear to rise above the stage - but even they can do so much. It seems that the 1950s were a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings as an actress, and that's good. He just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for her fans (I am among them) did not do too much of them. Despite an A-list distribution and good production value, it does not work.
