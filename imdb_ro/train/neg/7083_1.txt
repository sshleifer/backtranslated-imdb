My husband rented this from a video store, thinking it was suspense. (He never reads the synopsis). Well, it would be funny if the thing was tracked. It's just not. The same thing every time, without intrigue and where did the man find the top? Lead man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasible, especially for this role he is given. Also, sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see Michael Crichton's "Disclosure" hire. At least Michael Douglas showed well in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is usually watched, plays here an embarrassing scene. There are also cheaper lighting effects than webcam at home. Do not even waste time renting this. 0/10.
