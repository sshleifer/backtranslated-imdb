OK another movie I bought and Joe Swatman. Ok this is not the worst movie I've seen this week, but it's still royal. I had a lot of fun watching this piece of nonsense. Jigsaw Monster is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional student ideas, u only know ur problems when someone gives crew with a buzzsaw and a rifle cut, the movie was not as tormented as I hope, I mean from the deaths a heart attack. Again I think the action is shit, the sum of the actors must be porn stars and one to get into her weddings for any reason. <br /> <br /> The worst absolute part is the end, leaving it open for a bit of Jigsaw 2, but that never happens. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> Fun 4/100 mock (how fun I have mocked) 73/100 actioning 8/100 overall 12/100
