Best-selling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes on a mission for Sports Illustrated. He must go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try a position like the third Quarterback. He is quickly discovered by team members who present Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it amusing to cause hindrances in determining the writer to make Quarterback for a series in a real game. This film is Alda's debut and also helped Karras to leave the grids to act. In addition to the 1968 Detroit Lions, the cast includes Sugar Ray Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. Alex March leads this story based on Plimton's book.
