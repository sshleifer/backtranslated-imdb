... Bad evil intention ... <br /> <br /> This small stone shot directly on the big screen MST3k. Although it is obvious that the film does not try to be taken seriously (hopefully their purpose, anyway ...), the film is still very bad. Hell, it makes the leprechaun out of space look big budget ... In short: Paint my muscular carrot plum colored!
