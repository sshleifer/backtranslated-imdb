Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was frightened by this disgusting portrait of a man who was no more than a cattle sorcerer. Worse, the thread of the whole movie was sex in one form or another, implicitly or verbally. To see it, it would be thought that 18th-century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sexual and homosexual perversions. Lange was a joke that acted as a "young" mother at age 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish lake is NOT as common as it portrayed - but gave them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how much I was sexually. Save money and watch Pinnochio.
