I enjoyed Wesley Snipes earlier in some action and I expected much more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the film fails to entertain and even if the story is thin and non-original, the act is, unfortunately, thinner and moves a "worst case" scenario to play strong feelings accompanied by a bad action ... Do not waist your time this movie is not fun, if you want to cry it might be enough, however, even if your tears will be crying because of seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic wannabe action movie ... <br /> <br /> I give this 2/10 it was really terrible if you want to see a decent movie you go to see a shooter or rent it, all the good stuff this movie is not.
