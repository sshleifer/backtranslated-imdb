A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues his late father's scientific research on the regeneration of the limbs with flying colors, but the interfering domination of mother and lover doctor want to sell the serum. When he finds out, there's an accident in which Harry loses an arm. So he's trying his serum and what events is a genetic distraught arm that has a mind of his own. Oh, I've seen this so many times before, but what ups this very campanic and quite junk shonky rubber is the performance of film icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In fact, Fangoria is not a bad movie; only there are better out there that are similar in the vein. "Servene Links" simply do not have their own distinctive style. Physical nature and unpleasant splashes resembled the "Re-animator" and even with a touch of slapstick released as something from "Evil Dead 2". The comic story is really hit with black humor, but it can get melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises meet, especially the end result of filming. Which is well accepted, as I thought it could have done something more accessible. For a low-budget production, FX makeup can look rigid and very bad, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile more than you actually do. Even a sexual tension brush simplifies the story, thanks to Elke Sommer's poor performance as a mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorous in a broken sense and pulls him extremely well. Both of them have been deviated very much like a couple who liked to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in an erratic interpretation like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano penetrates intensely in the film and orchestrates some elegant scenes of grip and worry of horror. Yes, it's a minor and really silly nonsense, but you have to give it a hand for unusual entertainment.
