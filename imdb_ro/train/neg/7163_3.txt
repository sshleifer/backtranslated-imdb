<br /> <br /> After finishing my review of "Trance" or "The Eternal" or what the producers call this movie, I asked myself: "Of all the bad movies I could have seen, - Can I see at least one that is fun? Even if a movie is not well done in terms of acting, guidance, writing or what you have, it can be at least fun and therefore worth it But not only that this film is bad in artistic value, it is incredibly boring.For such a thin plot, it moves very slowly, with little dramatic tension.At least, in a low attempt of entertainment, the death of the characters would be it could have been cool and / or a gorilla, but the creators of this training have failed in that department too. Do this movie go for it? Quite a lot, unless you're having fun watching Christopher Walken, capable of shining t, puts so little effort into acting that it enters the self-parody mode (WHY did you decide to make this movie anyway?). br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10, so God can help us, in fact there were worse movies made before.
