Very strange, but occasionally an elegant exploitation film without a real story but benefiting from her charming actress full of charm and a handful of terrific and terrific make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-year-old girl who bears her trauma to be raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who is said to be a werewolf. He kills his brother-in-law during a night's meeting and is sent to a hospital. She escapes again, however, and devours randomly more people while running in for detectives, doctors and relatives. Everything is nice to look and listen too much (very good soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity becomes very irritating. Fortunately, the leading lady Annik Borel rarely wears clothes, and she makes the dull moments dancing naked around the fire. The movie is too long, too weird and too forgetful. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of blue, director Rino Di Silvestro is trying to make us believe that his movie was based on real facts. Yeah sure...
