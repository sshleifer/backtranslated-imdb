Who created this piece of nonsense, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I do not like how he creates low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a story so similar to the one in the first. I found this movie in the shell just outside Wild Things 2 and Death To Supermodels for $ 2.99 What a fool I was actually to think that might be good instead I watched in disgust as the weak action stereotypes broke by story and script from the first. Anyone who believed this right Video production on TV was actually even a half-decent film, you have to be cock or something because I think almost the bulk of people who have seen this movie think WHAT IS CRAP LOAD !!!!
