Judy Holliday hit the gold in 1950 with George Cukor's cinematic version of "Born yesterday," and since that time his career has been trying to find materials that are good enough to allow them to hit the gold again. never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I do not think of a bland title, by the way), Holliday is still making a wonderful blonde dress that may not be so simple after all, but all about this movie feels warm and with a half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what he think was his first film role, can not gather enough energy to animate this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end practically from the start, so in most cases it's just about waiting for the film to get to the bottom. Perhaps, if you feel loved by Holliday, you will enjoy it; otherwise I would not mind. <br /> <br /> Grade: C
