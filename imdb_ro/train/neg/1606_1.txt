In this film, Chávez's supporters (whether Venezuelan or non-Venezuelan) are just lying about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez's announcement, which fired a lot of the best PDVSA workers just for political issues. They did not say anything about more than 96 televisions, Chavez's interruptions in just three days in "NACIONAL CADENCE" (a sort of confiscation - private TV signals). Each of us, lasting about 20 minutes. They have not told us anything about the waiver announcement made by General Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, general inspector of the armed forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Minister of the Interior and Justice. After Chávez's return, he served as Ministro del Defensa (equal to the US Secretary of Defense). They have not said anything about Chávez's orders about the shooting against a concentration of the pacific population who claimed to have been elected. They did not say anything about the people in this concentration who were killed by the Chávez Supporters (either civilians or military official forces). They present some facts in the wrong order to lie. They did not say anything about the Venezuelan civil society, who is even now claiming elections to resolve the crisis and Chavez's actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you ... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
