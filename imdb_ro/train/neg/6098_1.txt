Scotty (Grant Cramer, who will star in the great B-Killer Klowns movie in space) agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to "ladies" dialogue in this bad comedy. It's not as bad as in the 1980s, which means good. Evil as well as bad. With no love character, including, but not limited to, a child who is the weirdest guy from "Friday, 13th", a girl who leads men and then enters her breasts when they want to touch it, fat slob, because, after all, what would be a 80-year-old sexual comedy to be free of fat? Well, he has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the bar of sexual comedies in the 1980s. And then came the continuation, thus deepening, proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- Eyed candies: too many to count, you will even see the child looking strangely imagined with tits to the point, I think "Party Bachlor" but not as funny, and very disturbing.
