There's a reason why Jay Leno himself will not recognize this movie. Constantly is one of the most serious movies of all time. The actress is horrible, the script has no direction, and the director does not seem sure how to take this movie. "A funny movie," "action / comedy," "mystery." He seems halfway, stops and is just for the trip. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It's a shame that they have lost their time and gifts doing this from a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita, before getting involved in this process, spent years working their way around the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right, acting steadily since the mid-1960s, as the star of such television and classical films, such as "Happy Days," and "Mr. and Tina." And he won the heart of America with his roles in the powerful movie, "Midway", "The Karate Kid", and a number of others. Mister. Leno has been seen on TV shows since the mid 70's. And he was a top performer in comedy clubs in America. It can be seen in countless TV spots and important films. It is a shame they have accepted to be seen with this nonsense.
