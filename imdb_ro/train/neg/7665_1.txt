Frankly, I can not be bothered to spend my time talking about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I'm saying is that Alone In The Dark manages only three things: 1. It makes you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. She manages to throw more unnecessary land in the air, but to give up all. <br /> <br /> 3. It is completely disappointed the classic PC game that is supposed to be based on the fact that it was a complete failure in all aspects of the movie. Doctor Boll, if this is really you (I think the proctology here), what do you do on the ground in the director's chair?
