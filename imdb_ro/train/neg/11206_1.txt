No one is a bigger fan of Gerry Macdonald Fraser's flashman than I do. I was surprised to see that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, because I see he did the three / four Musketeers with Fraser that we just did well. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. I was 12 years old when the movie was released and could not have been more enthusiastic ever since she read all of the published Flashman work up to that time and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (still there, but it was not never gave a chance afterwards). What disappointment (I saw it once when I was 20 years old on TV and it looked even worse). None of the sharp book dialogs is transferred to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me inappropriate in the same way that one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody they would do. The duel and the fencing were terrible and unsustainable. Looking behind his mature eyes, the film failed to exploit the satirical possibilities of the earlier versions of Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <If you read the book and you have not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything about books. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie more recently, but I'm glad I do not. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> If Fraser ever reads this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but on the basis of my appreciation of that corpus of work, it is hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as if he did all these awesome films Roger Moore James Bond.
