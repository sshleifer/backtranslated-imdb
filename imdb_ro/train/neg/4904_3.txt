Teamo Supremo are three children, made up of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battle (Chika! Wopa!) And with costumes and moves. They work for Governor Kevin and have been recruited after they want to be heroes and play for that game. They also lead normal lives and have family and school obligations, but most of the action takes place far away from school-war criminals. The villains have all the unique and singular features, such as Mr. Vague and his men who never seem to know what plans they have, but to act anyway. From a bad robot to an evil baron, the three must meet them and stop their evil plans, often strange, to gain power, take revenge, and so on. The animation itself is pretty nice and enjoyable, but the style seems to be simple for purpose. The background has overlapping colors, and the buildings seem to be futuristic. The music is pretty pretty and the show is not too bad altogether, although style is not my favorite. Parcels are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and we can not blame it for it. However, this would not be the same degree as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
