It's not a movie for a woman, but a movie for the band. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy McKay just does not know the woman. Too bad taste, American Pie humor, brutal story, no sense, unreasonable story, rejected characters. The vulgar fantasies came to the screen. Insult and certainly not funny. I wonder how they accepted three good actresses to participate in her.
