Ah, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris were wild with rebellion, the hippies were tall in the spirit of love. How has Britain been marked this era of radicalism and revolution? Erm, as it turns out, the old Blighty's sake focused on making movies about boys in boarding schools. If ... it contains the bad unit. It contains the revolt of the oppressed. What he lacks, unlike the passion of the Parisians and the hippy trap, is any feeling of emotion, except that fire ends with ammunition and artillery. Lindsay Anderson If ... - the great Malcolm McDowell, one of the three private school pupils who decorate their home with photos of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. It is clear an anti-establishment film in his description of the top-class bad villains leading the collapse and the old autocratic practices of the public school standard. What it does ... If ... it is unusual that, for all its radical sympathies, it does not explicitly give us a feeling of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system, but just a kind of floating: of plotting and lacking personality. <br /> <br /> Surrealist bits fade occasionally, and the film slips from black and white to red again (due to low budget or is it an artistic expression?), but there is little interest in talking about. All we receive is the destruction in which young rebels return for their rifles and pull down the shadowy masters of unity. Hurray! A Revolution! Finally something that requires a second thought, unlike the rest of this boring exercise in internal school. If ... it could have been a strong political affirmation, but a sense of direct interest to the end. Instead of being a testimony of the sixty-year-old dissident zeitgeist, it manages to be just a stunning documentary of first-class British education. Anarchy? Apathy more, the only man that many viewers will want to keep after they have looked If ... will be Lindsay Anderson.
