This seems like two films: a long, long-running saga of an actor who is taken over by the plays he plays; the other, a brilliant social commentary about a middle-aged divorce taken by a waitress. Shelley Winters is great as a waitress with another business on the side. It gets rid of the hardship of the need for connections, the massage certificate and the desire to enter the modeling game. I like to take a look at her kitchen, with a kitchenette behind a drapery, and a terrible seduction chaos with a crocheted end with a pocket, revealed, with bumps. Doctors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know that the Oscars to get along with people with disabilities, wearing a lot of prostheses or pretending to be upset. Shakespeare scenes (which go ON too) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the "crazy" scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice. By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it quite clear in an early scene that he was a choir boy. When he cites his father's advice, he enters a Cockney accent.
