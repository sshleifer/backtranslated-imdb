I've found a good movie to pass your time, but it's not a historic one. The representation of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap digging. The tower of deeds is ... funny! She gave birth to her people's food! Oh, please ... A pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not bother to go from one room to another for this reason! They tried to make her appear a saint for God! And the way they tried to justify killing their own suri ... beyond the description. Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. Her decisions were based only on feelings and morals. He did everything for two reasons: power and self-preservation! She was carried into a family in which she had to overthrow herself for survival, something she did very well. Everything on the way was either killed (her brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately, Octavian was too strong to kill and ... gay to be seduced. So it was her end ...
