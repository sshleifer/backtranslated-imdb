Generally, I do not do minus and if this site could give this movie -3 out of 10 which means I really looked at this movie. I thought Uwe Boll alone in the dark was the worst I've seen yet, but at least I gave her a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shot at nothing made me laugh, so I amplified ratings a bit). Hell, if it were compared to blood, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best film if they competed. Now, in the film, the movie refers to the BTK killer who is fine, but he could have done better. The start seemed OK, but I had to repeat the majority because death is boring. I like movies with killers and even if she sucks that she might still get death. I'm not a film expert, but I think he would have shot if he saw that. I'm sorry I saw it, but there's nothing good to say about it, because it looks like somebody took a video camera and shot this ... disaster thing. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worse movies ever getting this cake. I'm sorry I could not explain the plot (if it was one) but it was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind, I will be dragged in a corner and move you back and forth and remind you how bad this movie scared me for life ... OK not for life
