I just finished looking at the guinea pig - the Devils experiment. I have to say that this film, although it had a very good FX, better than I expected, was NOT a good movie. Frankly, I can not say I liked this movie at all. Of course, it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, 43-minute twisted torture, but it sounded very boring (and not as upsetting as I was hoping). And I also found that torturers were very annoying when they spoke and tried to sound tough all the time, which destroyed it even more (and I'm sure there are some who will agree with me). I have now seen the guinea-pig 1,2,3,5 and the best of those who, in my opinion, is the guinea pig 2 - Flowers of meat and blood. I will not say much more about the Devils experiment, other than the "Great FX", the descent from the face, the annoying torture of the fuctors, generally give it 4 stars for the FX, because they are wonderful.
