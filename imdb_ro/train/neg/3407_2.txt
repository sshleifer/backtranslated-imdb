OK, forget all the technical inconsistencies or physical impositions of spacecraft accidentally launched by a strange robot with a golden heart. Forget about the hideous special effects and the unidimensional characters built badly. Just looking at the premise of the story. The reason why the movie will be first and you will see how bad this movie was made up together. I know 9 years who look at this insult of intelligence and just laugh at it. The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message it tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse is that the KEEP SHOWING IT movie channels! Twice a day, every two or three days! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would like to see this painful celluloid piece several times, much less to see it at all? My recommendation is that I do not even bother to spend the energy to watch this thing. It simply is not worth it.
