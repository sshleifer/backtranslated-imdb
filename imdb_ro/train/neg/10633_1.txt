I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover has a scene from the Capricorn One movie in 1975. The film starts with several missile clips, most of which are not related to the crew flight. Sibrel Smoke Piston is a short video of the astronauts who are preparing a video show. He edits in his own voice instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video ends curiously with a presentation of the Zapruder movie. His claims on radiation, shielding, street shots, and others make me think he is extremely ignorant or has a kind of ax to split up from NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
