Good movies can not rely solely on a beautiful garden and on a hilltop. Surprised to see he won two awards. Extremely overestimated. I've seen movies for the first time in China, amazingly visually, but with something really exciting to say, well, more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure there are still more. This is not one of them, I'm afraid.
