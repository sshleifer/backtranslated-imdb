The working comedy has I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall investigating the eccentric family in Maryland, who has never paid his taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the tomboy farmer, who squeezes the man who is not so disinterested. Debbie certainly did some of the lower theater sitcoms during this time - and that's not better or worse than the rest. The image starts intense, but the flags are halfway, becoming frenetic and mindless. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel Darling Gifts in May by H.E. Bates, with a poor sound mix that makes all actors sound like they're stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
