If you are not an evangelical Christian, then do it as an Egyptian and avoid biblical plague. Great - why oh why IMDb lists the most favorable comments at the top of the list - of which we lost the end of what started out like a good night on this clapper. The premise of the plot started quite strong - I was attracted to the film and was interested even to the point where biblical sermons took over. What a loss. This movie has soaked me so I recorded with IMDb for the first time just to cry - I hope at least to do this by saluting someone else. <Br /> <br /> Hay - what I believe Christian from me ;-)
