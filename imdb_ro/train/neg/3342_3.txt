I did not expect much of a movie directed by Sidney J. Furie and Dolph Lundgren, but I would definitely have expected more than I received. A single-pass user commentary - a second-round action movie - did not seem too depressing for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered watching this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but hey, the movie had a score of 5.9 out of 10, which seemed quite acceptable to me for this type of production . <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of those who rated this movie with 10 (excellent) were clearly a stunt advertiser because DETENTION is the usual No Image trash that you've seen before, over and over. /> Lundgren does not convince a former military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school. His act is simply terrible, excited and controversial. Lundgren's lack of action becomes more visible in the scenes of juvenile delinquent children. Whether they are great actors, or, as compared to Lundgren, they seem to be great actors - just because they look natural and credible. DETENTION has some elements that might have been interesting for this low-budget movie - for a high-security high-school weekend, four teenagers in detention with a veteran war teacher and a group of ruthless criminals who are trying to get in - but the story (like the BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD or PANIC ROOM?) is filled with incredible situations, lots of clichés and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a couple of Bonnie and Clyde in love and offer the most acceptable shows of the film, even though it seems to be a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a wish of Milla Jovovich. In a movie where everything fails, their madness and style have provided enough fresh air to prevent my interest from scratching.
