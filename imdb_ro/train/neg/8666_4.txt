This thriller produced by television is everything you talk about, small action. He works hard to set up his complicated plot, yet the writing is so tangled that the exhibition is mostly purest. After all, I did not know more about these characters than I did in the beginning. She has a quasi scenario - "Ten Little Indians," but she shoots her half in favor of Sally Field's luminous focus and the discovery of a killer. The field stops here with a pardon that I do not see very rarely. Early introduction is good, but the writing moves away quickly from the field and eventually passes over the top. A lot of hysteria and thunder effects and constant lightning (which adds nothing). A curious failure of the producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could not we give more than a scenario full of red herring and Sally Field hiding in a closet?
