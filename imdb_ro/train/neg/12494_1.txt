There was nothing about this movie that I liked. It was so obvious a low budget, with poor illumination and the camera (almost like the Blair Witch Project, but that was not supposed to be so). There was not much to plot, and the movie just drugs over and over. In fact, we've gone through the last 1/3 of the movies, but that did not help too much. It looked like it could be good out of the box, but I have to say again: nothing about this movie looks like at all. They were not good actors, the special effects were so fake, the room was horrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible. On my personal scale, I give this movie 0 out of 10. Vouchers!
