This was a really insipid movie. Performances are the third rate, and the dialogue is so stressed that sometimes it seems that it has just stayed and died. My reason to rent this was simple: Find a movie with scripts. I need visual help for my presentation, so I figured out why I do not use a clip? The boy was wrong. After I searched for the local video store, I came to this where she was suspected as "Starstruck". I thought, "What hey," and decided to try. Well, I was very dissatisfied with my results. It was a scene I could use and in the meantime I almost fell asleep because of the pure banality of the film. So ... I took her back and took Ed Wood. There is a movie I can use as an example. Then, again, anything that is presentable in comparison with the sweetness that is "Starfucker".
