What land has become for our sake Ramu? Is that the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe that. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped from the tall rock he advanced, giving industry some of the greatest works of all time. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I went to the theater, but I was forced to sit because I could not take my car out of the car park before leaving others. Otherwise, nothing would have made me stay beyond the interval. This movie is not close to Sholay. He does not even get close to him in less than a mile. I think Ramu loves Na≈ü more than Sholay, because Sarkar was a classic piece. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, where the interviewer said that Ramu is no longer sleeping for more than 4 hours a day, and that is not stretched. I totally agree with this now because his lack of sleep probably took the film fee. There is no power in the show. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. It looked terrifying in some posters and wallpapers I'd seen earlier. Ramona Nisha Kothari made a fantastic job in Sarkar because he did not have too many dialogues (in fact, none if I remember clearly). He opened his mouth in this film and found a place in history. The new guy who plays Jai seems to have that weird look, but he has never managed to manage Jai's role. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to do right now. I promised in the whole movie that I would follow the original Sholay once again to see that he was still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: horrible movie. Mass media and critics will cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind them of all the readers, I am one of Ramu's biggest fans and I can not even spare him for this act.
