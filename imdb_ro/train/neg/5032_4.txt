This movie was in a science fiction pack 50, a friend of mine took me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie and, like that movie, has scenes with American actors inserted without a real motif. One interesting thing about the scenes introduced is that there is a tension of cold war between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and lights up all over the world, paying special attention to Tokyou because no monstrous film is complete if Tokyo does not beat him. On the whole, this is a good movie. Some scenes involving Gamera, especially the Toly scenes, are pretty spectacular and have special effects that were quite decent at the time. If you like giant Japanese movies of monsters, you'll really get a shot of it. I'll give 4 out of 10. If it were the unauthorized Japanese version I followed, it would probably have been 5 years.
