- A movie crew shoots a horror movie in an old, perhaps damn, old house where, over the years, seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew finds an old book of spells, and it seems it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is justified that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using. But as the book reads, the outer cemetery suddenly comes to life. Now distribution and crew are facing real danger. - IMDb displays a 90-minute operating time. In the first 60 minutes, nothing happens. Too much time is spent on the movie. Should we be scared of the horror movie I shoot? We already know that their movie is not "real". These scarecrows do not work. There are very few things you can enjoy from the House of the 7 Corps. The act is atrocious. Most of these "actors" would have difficulty in building an elementary school. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of the television series of the 70s and does not offer the atmosphere. Speaking of the atmosphere, besides a few moments from the end of the movie, no one is spoken. Logical characters are non-existent. Even in a movie, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think I remember a scene where a character did not choose the most illogical path she has at her disposal. And finally, it's the first 60 minutes of the movie I've already mentioned. You can say? <br /> <br /> - We did not evaluate the House of the Seven Lower Corps due to situations where the movie (perhaps by chance) works. The two favorites are the beginning and the end. The opening title sequence is the death of the seven previous owners and may be the culmination of the film. And, final scenes from the massive ladder as the zombie threatens the film crew are somewhat effective (which is a call approval). However, in general, these moments are not enough to make this movie good.
