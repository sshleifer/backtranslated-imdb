... not that all Disney movies are garbage. Anyway, I first saw the "Legend of Boggy Creek" and I absolutely loved the movie. When I heard he had two sequels, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and I looked at it one evening. I do not see how I can make a sequel to a horror movie. The original is a movie / documentary about the Fauke monster and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be pursued by anyone. I do not remember the plot well, because it's been a while since I watched it and I will not follow it, but ... It's about these hunters coming to town and going to kill Bigfoot. Three young children leave the house to stop them. A big monsoon comes through. Hunters are injured, they are saved by children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large piece of tarpaulin on top and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I do not want to destroy the end for any of you, but it's not scary. Good....
