Alas, poor Hamlet. I met him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THESE VERSIONS SUCCESS! I do not know which of all people have put the money on the run, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classical piece and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so bad that even the presence of a great spectator, such as Maximilian Schell, in the lead role can not save him. The only quality of this movie is that it has made great feeds for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo, and Crow had a lot of fun with that. But anyway, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he had lived when they did, would not want his name to be associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not so bad that it's good; it is simply bad. Very awful.
