It's interesting to see what the director has tried with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie, and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were a little superficial and you did not bother either of them. Pretty mild (and sometimes even bad) photography leaves a bit desirable, but I think you can not expect much from people who just make a low-budget movie for heck of it. It's wrong to review the movie and compare it to other high-budget movies. But, unfortunately, this must be done. On its own, it's not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it is not without its good points! I liked the plot. It was built quite nicely and tied together at the end. Sometimes, in the really dark scenes, he managed to create a creepy feeling. However, in the end, the film fails to impress. Characters are almost non-existent and we do not care about any of them. Whatever may die, but it is possible to identify the last "survivor" very early.
