One might want an idea as good as "invisible man" to work better and be more carefully treated in the fantastic era of special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters, and ultimately the last 20 minutes of the film are as fresh as a crazy scientist film in the early 1950s. There are some wonderful moments, especially due to the amazing special effects and even the idea of ​​an invisible man walking through the streets. But unfortunately we will soon return to the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic. movies or TV shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their charm. But it is becoming clearer and clearer for every film that the idea of ​​putting the classic ol under the nose of crazy madmen like Verhoeven (which has its moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that money is the key issue: the time and energy introduced into the scenario is not close enough and as a result Hollow Man is seriously undermined by clichés, sapwood, predictability and lack of depth. However, the only thing that really impressed me, apart from the special effects, was the rage. When making this type of film, modern makers are very keen to let children see them. Therefore, language (and sometimes violence and gender) is very tiring. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go "Oh, darn!" and "Oh, my God." "The naked man" repeatedly renounces this kind of hypocrisy, and the characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying the most natural answer to something bad is to swear - but it makes it more credible if someone swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
