There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money just was not there to make the story of justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) wrote credit "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", who was a box office spy. However, the movie had some serious Disney money claims. Honestly, this is a good example of not making a movie. If it had waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of these effects. (not to mention that he could find a company with money.)
