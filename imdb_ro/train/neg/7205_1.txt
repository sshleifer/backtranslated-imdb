If you like to see what must have begun as a 2-hour film in unsettled unsightly outbursts, you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise, you wonder how it could have made such a movie from something so simple to translate into the big screen as the Gadget Inspector. In movie previews, there were many scenes that were not in the movie and in the movie, some scenes did not make sense. While the movie is a little less than an hour and a half, I'm thinking of a really memorable moment, and even before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
