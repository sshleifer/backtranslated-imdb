I can not believe this show is still rated 9 out of 10. I could see if these votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would anyone have to continue to rate it afterwards? I was a big fan in the first season. I was coupled - all mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. In Season 2, we were still following with fidelity, but we became a little frustrated that some basic things were not to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, they seemed to have more questions. I love the suspense, but you have to throw people from time to time to watch them. Now, I do not even remember what left me behind, but somewhere in Season 2, I've had enough. I'm not a big fan of meeting viewing - and clearly you can not lose an episode to stay on what's going on. So, it's no longer worth the effort for me. It's a shame that they could not have been a little cleverer and more careful of loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that ABC seems to have just become greedy and decided to see how long this show can stretch. They do not realize they will eventually lose more fans than they could win.
