I see that someone has already thought of a similar analogy that was similar to the first thing that came to my mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. Besides sex scenes that are bordering on porn-child (which I think could have been edited or had been more suggestive in nature than graphic, I would have liked this movie with a half-broken recipe. of ingredients without indications on how to put them together in a finished product. From the beginning, character development and story development are missing ... unfortunately, often in this monotony, we are teased with pieces of plot, and we think "Ahh-OK ... we'll finally find out more about what this scene is ... or ... Who is this character ... or maybe we finally get to know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and get involved more with this inter-personal relationship ... etc. "But no such good luck! On the contrary, I was often tempted to stop him several times , but I blocked him when the carrot was it just tangled to discover that any mini-plot in the mini-plot (and the poorly presented) was just a shame. Why we stayed with him until the end of the year is a mystery other than usual IFC has better selections and gave them 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It is not that the characters are not pleasant to a certain degree or that they can not identify with them or with their humanity ... that could have been much better with just a little more effort. I notice he was shot around Santa Cruz and I wake up wondering if it was the project of a movie school for somebody. I wish I had a better review, but it was a frustrating and disappointing loss for an hour and a half.
