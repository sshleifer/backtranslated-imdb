I own this movie. Not by choice, me. I was very bored the next day and the box intrigued me. So I grabbed it in the old VCR and spent the next and a half hours of my life crying "why God why?" The story line was not that bad, as a player, I could appreciate his bits. I think maybe if you're in a romantic chess scene, you'll enjoy this movie. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know as Dr. Spock ... unable to love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it really is terrible. But if you're up to a really bad movie this is the one for you !!! The real story is more interesting though; <br /> <br /> If you had to summarize this movie in one word it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
