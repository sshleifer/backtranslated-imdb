I have to admit I was laughing when I saw a commentator who compared this with LOTR. Well, yes, if you exclude dwarves, thousands, great special effects, big battles, strong characterization, decent plot, good action, elegant direction and everything else. Which leaves you on foot. And boy, make this movie walking! If Mr Piano had his way, it would probably be an uninterrupted three-hour walk through the Wisconsin area, but every 40 minutes these boring Martians take a few seconds to interrupt him before going for another tour. You have never seen so much walking in a movie. If he really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of him should have walked on Mr. Piano's shoes, because he had to go through many pairs with all his walking. Which explains why there is no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or the right actors. Honestly, it's like watching a bizarre fetish video for people who have something to do for long walks in antique costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg ride. As far as SF news is concerned, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they just stop walking, which is clearly more interesting for the director than the story. I wonder how much Mr. Piano charges dogs?
