This Charles trip is decent, but this is a fairly low performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forget to develop and hurt the movie a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with Charles was bad enough.
