This is the worst damaged brain, the extremely cheap, super stupid, silly, useless, garbage I've ever seen, an incredible garbage of instant cult status among the bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that one. Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's more than bad, really. But if you are looking for such incredible movies, it's for you! I am a fan of the international American for so many glorious horror films, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some wonderful things of blaxploitation, but with Star Creatures they go down to Z. Of course, 1 in 10 works in reverse if you want to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an Indian boss is great) you have fun and enjoy yourself ... if you can.
