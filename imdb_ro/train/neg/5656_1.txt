Ziab to ta'kol al lahem is a terrible film. This is just an overlap of scenes without a clear connection. It is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor, such as Ezzat El allayli. But something really amazing in this film, talking about sexuality, women's empowerment, nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema even today. I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see this style more in Egyptian movies, but with better quality. The reasons that prompted me to vote this movie as terrible are not just scenarios and actions, but also lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur. We can see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabian film, Ziab at ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies from all over the Arab world, watch it and make your friends and family do the same.
