This movie is wonderful, your mind - but only in the way it says a very BAD story. Stella is so rude and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and little-minded. Never learn better. Is this realistic? In a sense, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her manners and dress, but does not she understand that she just has to tune it all up? I do not think. Stella is a good woman and a VERY GOOD MOTHER. To love you so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigot snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see might have been normal for those times - people who have a beer or two, enjoying a piano, dancing, but it is a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not have our baby live like this!" Spare me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unseen class can never hope to aspire to the high class heights. And that's just a load of worms.
