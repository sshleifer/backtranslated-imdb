Two types of films we love are (1) westerns and (2) films 30 or 40 years ago. We should have liked Sanie of the Named Man; BUT ..... BUT ... this image is disagreeable, annoying and bad from start to finish. Because there is no one in the story (good or bad) to warm up, there is no one to motivate the suspense necessary to keep the viewer interested. No fellowship among boys trying to steal gold and no camaraderie among those who try to protect him. Sledge has a beautiful girlfriend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this unconscious pig. The film also suffers from a gawdawful intrusion and musical score, and from the extremely poor writing and direction by Vic Morrow. Of the 30 oldest movies leased from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the bottom of the rock, the only real dock in the pile.
