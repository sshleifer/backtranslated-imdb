Competition for the worst film Warner Bros. Kay Francis is rigid. I've seen only eight of them, but Comedy on Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing is that it's short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly dresses (of course) are good. James Wong Howe's movie is not. Kay Francis looks all over his face and much less attractive than he normally does. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know otherwise, is good as a semi-hard burlesque dancer (she looked like a fashion show rather than a burlesque). Closing attempt - Kay Francis and her child (when the child learned that Kay Francis was her mother? I stopped?), Climbing a dirty cloth to a painted prison in dirty contours on a sound stage is beyond ridiculous. The whole movie is so cheap, so implacable and so negligent that it feels infected by a sour cynicism from all those who did it: Warner Bros. throwing garbage into garbage I do not know in Warner Bros.'s cynical estimation , that what I get is garbage.
