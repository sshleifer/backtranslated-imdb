I wanted to see it for two reasons. One was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the play Bogart was performed by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with subtlety, as in the Big Knife. But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors do not care, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance gets bored at Shelley Winters, and Shelley Winters asks what he does in this film. I do not even want to compare it with Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they had to use the story of the dog again! Of course he could have seen different ideas. Maybe the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra, but that certainly does not add any quality to the movie. It's a waste of time if you saw High Sierra before. Otherwise, why do not you see a pseudo-film noir. As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather die more than see once again ...
