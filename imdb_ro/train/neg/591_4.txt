I was really disappointed with this movie. he started really well and built a great atmosphere and suspense, but when he ended up revealing the "monster" ... he turned out to be just a skinny psychopath ...... again. Coughed-to-do. Another filming movie ... as if we do not already have enough. <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, the "creep" is really disturbing to watch and the way the strange sounds move it is pretty creepy, but I'm tired of renting a movie of this kind only to discover that the monster is human, though a twisted, dementia, weird one. When we saw all of the rats early this year, we hoped it would be a kind of monster-rat hybrid ... he was so disappointed when Creep was revealed. this, some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell Creep kills the Security Guard? What does it mean, besides sticking a big gold sign that says "HI am a PSICHO AND YOU GOD HERE HERE!"? It's stupid and it only happens to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help. What the hell did he eat there? I have the impression that it was actually swallowed and only the unexpected opening in that section of the tunnel left him to lose ... So he ate rats all the time and if so, why did he hang on so much about it? Why is it so hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not even at peak performance ... but seems to continue to continue, despite lesions that are equivalent to those that pass the non-psycho characters into the movie. The DVD comment says they are meant to be empathetic with Creep, but I find it stupid. It's a fairly efficient film, but it wasted so many opportunities to make me die.
