A good movie, with a beautiful lady, but a terrible top man. Stephan Jenkins, who interprets her husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the rescue of the film. She is the best actor of the group. <br /> <br /> The first comment, by the colleague who gathered the praise of the film (and, according to IMDB.com, wrote only one review - and guess what film?) is obviously a plant. While the movie is shot beautifully, it is in no way subtle or great, or any other hypobolic descriptions that the reviewer has used. "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it's a big press. It offers all kind of sexual situations, but it never passes through it. Like watching a movie on Cinemax, but with all the "poor naughty" edited. The film as a whole is a little naked, and the end and much of the third act is really a big misery. There is a final spin, of course, because every film nowadays finds it necessary to end a twist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
