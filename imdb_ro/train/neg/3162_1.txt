I never really bothered to finish the movie because I was so bored I thought I was going out I was watching the cinemas and I and my friends just got tired so we woke up and left in another movie if I it must always stand for up to 2 minutes. from that movie again I think I'm going to shoot ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and I was not surprised at all why I did not know he was going to do the right thing to let him be happy, I mean you should be a complete idiot not knowing that. I know I did not miss anything and if someone asks me to see the movie say "over my dead body".
