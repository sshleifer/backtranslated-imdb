From critical appreciation, I've been expecting more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story just laughed along and does not seem to have a point or a plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or not) would be so blasphemous to get the loss of her virginity "with". Maybe I'm too young to have a relationship (I was 4 years old in 1976), but I had no problem dealing with Shakespeare's stories in love or my life is beautiful and I was not alive for those settings either. The distribution is very good, but unfortunately the script did not allow them to engage the audience. Overall, the Slums has had its moments, but if you do not want to remember the weightlifting charts and the tube socks, I'd say you skip it.
