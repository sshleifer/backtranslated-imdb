Jean Luc Godard's Marxist polemic is just as close to an unwanted movie as you'll probably see him from an internationally respected film producer. The bits of the political, boring and interminable theater are scattered with "Sympathy for the Devil", presenting Rolling Stones in the studio. The Mick Jagger song development process that plays an acoustic guitar demo, the vowels being recorded to the end, is fascinating, and it's worth renting this movie just to see the Stones bits. Almost half the film is dedicated to this, so, thanks to the chapter stop miracle, you can jump over all the bizarre political sketches and just watch Stones put together a song together. When I had this on the laserdisc, I tried hard to see everything, but I do not see how anyone could pass through it. Eventually I gave up and just the chapter - it was my way to the Stones segments.
