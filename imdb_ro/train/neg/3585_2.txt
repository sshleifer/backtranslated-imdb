As a great fan of gorilla movies, we generally anticipated that it would be great - and with regard to the effects of the gorilla, they were pretty good, though - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The movie claims to be based on a true story, but in fact it does not even come close to what actually happened with "Buddy" - who in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold Ringling Bros. of our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known to many animal enthusiasts as a woman who had hardly welfare of her animals in the best interest. As for friends portrayed as becoming aggressive, it was total fiction and, at no time, the gorilla, in real life, to resort to such behavior. his friend escaped from his wooden box (not in a plush room as described in the film) during a storm to seek shelter and comfort in the house that frightened Gertrude Lintz to sell it. No, Buddy was not released into a family of gorillas, surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden cage, deep behind a garage for some time, with a single light bulb for comfort and then sold the circus - if he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically, the oldest life gorilla in history, anyway) before a show in Miami. Also notice in the movie, how older friends grow, but chimpanzees never age. (The chimpanzees were not, at the same time, lifted simultaneously with other animals, including friends, portrayed in the film)
