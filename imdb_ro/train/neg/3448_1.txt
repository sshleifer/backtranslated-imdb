I checked this movie when she had 6 votes and said it was something like 7.2 or something, but seriously this movie is horrible. Let's break it down. The first thing you notice about this film is that it was filmed on a digital camera owned by a baccalaureate student at a community college. the next thing you will notice is that the actors are all friends of the meeting (they probably met at the pub the night before.) Third, you'll notice that music editing is horrible and tries to hunt many songs in this movie at 30 second intervals ... also all the digital edits are done on the freshman's PC ... probably using the movie maker of the movie. This movie was horrible ... pretentious, had an undeniably bad scenario and acted I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I condemn the writer and the director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity.
