This is a 1974 German film that has to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond, I can not really tell you their purpose or even the purpose of the film. I can tell you that there are more women who also light the moon as ministers at this particular castle, which strips, put on body paint and gyrate to bongos, such as at Goth Kit-Kat Klub, however, and it seems to be a good part of the running time of this film. Yes, there seems to be something devout and vampire worship, and there is a girl on girl stuff, but the main focus seems to be chickens dyed in the basement. I rather made my glasses from one of the devil's main patrons / followers, who gave the procedure authenticity and made them worse. Was Wanda the Bad Lesbian (as it is billed in credits)? Does not matter. If you're not too pretentious about your lesbian devil worshiping the movie, you might want it, otherwise things are pretty boring and I could not finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
