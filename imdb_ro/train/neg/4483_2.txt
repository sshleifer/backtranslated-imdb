I will admit that I liked it first, and I was really looking forward to the continuation. I was disappointed. Of course, the special effects were technically stunning - but they were not credibly forgotten. He looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit that I like 80% of the search scene - but the fight with all the gentlemen Smith? He was too animated. I can accept all this. What I can not accept is that the parties that are not part of the action were stupid. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in a speech that went on forever and did not mean anything. I was also disappointed with the little plot that exists. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except for the existence of the matrix). This movie was a bit like seeing the DALLAS episode where you find out that the whole previous season was a dream. Ugh! I want $ 7.00 back!
