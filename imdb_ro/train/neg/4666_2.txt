This film is about a Japanese woman who has a calligraphy obsession on her skin. The land is absolutely bizarre. I can not see the "sensual" or "erotic" subtones. Cake turns a form of old art into a fetishist pornography. In addition, scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly some bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the mid-city airport, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the movie, I think that "The Book of Pillow" insults Japanese culture and the environment in Hong Kong. "The Book of Pillow" is a perverted and yet boring film. Really stay away from him.
