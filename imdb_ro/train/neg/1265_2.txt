First of all, I did not want to watch this movie because the trailer impressed an ordinary and too-anticipated movie ... but I had the pleasure to discover surprisingly "Mensonges et trahisons et plus and affinité" "that was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard ("prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ... "(The scenario is not bad, but it's not as well guided as" Mensonges ... ", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as usual) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac, also to be honest, I still do not understand how such nonsense can have such a success, even with such a casting ... However the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it's not as good as "Mensonges ..." by Tirard, though it's written by him too. cruel and lazy, totally overestimated!
