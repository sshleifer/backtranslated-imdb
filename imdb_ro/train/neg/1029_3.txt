My father is a fan of Columbo and I have always been disliked show. I always express my contempt for the show and tell her how bad she is. But he keeps looking at him. That's his right as an American, I think. But my senses were tuned in when I heard that Spielberg directed the premier episode. Then I was grateful that my father bought this show that I really can not stay. I went through her DVD collection and threw that when I came home for a college visit. My opinion of the series as a whole has not been influenced, but I have earned respect for Spielberg knowing that it started like most of the lower level directors. And that makes a little dribbling until the big fish comes along (get word, HA, HA, as Spielberg did as Jesus before he became a man or at least what they think he would feel. Columbo than you probably like this even though it contains little by Peter Falk. I attribute this to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and nobody knew where to go with it yet. This episode mainly focuses on the guilty of murder instead of Columbo's investigation, as would be the case for several subsequent episodes.
