Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow), which is being watched by a psycho killer who tries to kill her on the night. And so doing to kill her family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before you start, let me tell you that you have been tired of horror films PG-13 that have not been scary lately. You are tired of the bad girl dialogue "Oh my God" and talk about girlish things. And you're really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing you've tired of filming in Asia, Japan and China. That sums up Prom Night, but I'm not finished with the review. The only reason to see "Night Prom" is to crack a laugh at the kill. If not, you do not see Prom night. You never see that he kills one guy who yells and you see some blood on the wall. And the way in which deaths are repeated as 24/7. So not only are they not frightening, but it's unpleasant. The moment I met the cast, I think I was ready to throw. Too many talks about the girl, too many words, and a lot of "God, it's our ball." I understand it's fun, but serious is too much to ask not to focus. <br /> <br /> If I had the Prom Night on the list of the worst movies in 2008 without seeing the other movies, I would be the first. I will not be surprised if it will be released on DVD for cheap and fast money. Seriously, you do not spend money or time for dull action, cheap scares and a "night to die for" when you watch the movie. 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the star movie I would want).
