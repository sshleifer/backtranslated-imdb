OK, I bought this Woolworths movie for my boyfriend for a joke on his birthday because the front cover had a sexual clue in it. But we decided to pursue it anyway. Just for hunting purposes. And I'm sorry, but that must be, one of the worst movies in history. It started out well, and we thought "Ok that could be ok". But after about 10 minutes, we were unfortunately wrong. It began when the "mysterious paint wizard" turned out to be the most obvious character, Scouser / Australian (saying that because he had an accent that could not be identified), which behaves to say only that he was absurd. Then it came to an end and, by that time, we all lost the will to live. Finish of the paint ball. The only thing I liked about this plot is that they did not actually win, but quite annoyingly they won by default. And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name of the team was just given was terrible. Critical damage. That is, he could choose a more wonderful name, such as "Antichrist destroyers" or something. Or that should be called the movie anyway.
