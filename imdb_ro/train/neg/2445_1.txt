Hello, can somebody hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you are another participant in this movie: enter the fanclub! This movie was so incredibly bad that I could not help laughing when I saw her. I think we have to see, it's bad in a beautiful way. Each clich√© ever invented for a horror film can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top ten worst-ever films ever made.
