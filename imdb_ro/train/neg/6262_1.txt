I agree with those reviews I've read here and I have no word to define such a turkey, but despite all the things I find another reason for such movies to exist. Do you relive your happy days when the video was a prosperous business and many movies were made with the only reason to fill the shelves of the video stores? this movie comes from that time and I can imagine it was the only reason it was produced and the same thing happened with many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember the "Rambo" imitations? and so many grade Z's slasher, I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie I can say I did not miss my time watching because I pressed the button fast before the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene in which a guy pushes an ax against the exploding heads because, as you can see perfectly, they were made of plastic. And about the end of the movie, it was so badly shot that I did not understand what happened. The same thing we did not do at all was tracking the nonexistent plot. But guys, video age was a wonderful age, despite some movies like this.
