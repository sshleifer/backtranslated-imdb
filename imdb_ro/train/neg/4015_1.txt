a friend told me that he was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas." Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is the most unlucky lead actress in the porn industry ever. Even more terrible is she's on the screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere that in those days, porn had to have an "artistic" value. But I could not find it. Check it out only if you're interested in the history of porn development in the mainstream or appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to make Simon & Garfunkel give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected it.
