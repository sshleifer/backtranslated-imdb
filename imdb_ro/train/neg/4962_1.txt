99.999% pure carp. And the other .001% was a short time when I thought the blonde chick would be undressing. Not. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendary evil. The action sucks, and there was no sex (the blonde chick mentioned above is modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen on the film, and the anachronisms were numerous and brilliant. The action was mediocre from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "name" in the movie. And Marina Sirtis really looked really bad. I've seen high-school high school play. This is the kind of movie that MST3K has thrived on. Chiefs should rotate to Sci-Fi to allow this pile of steam into the air.
