First of all, I want to say that this movie is worthy of more than the four stars I've rated. I gave him four stars, because for me this 86-minute movie always looks like 2 and a half hours, and I do not get enough to sit on it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title the DVD calls it) is better than your natural nature back in the movie. A tourist resort in the South Asian jungles is just opening and hiring natives while trying to manipulate wildlife around. Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the Kroon god, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and staff of the resort) have to worry about, indigenous people get used to the wrong way. quite well done adventure / horror story with a good score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously false. Some of the closest jaws are good, but it should be all we have to see. Some of the remote underwater photographs make it increasingly obvious that what we really do is a sparkling alligator toy, you can probably get to a souvenir shop in the zoo. But natives are credible, if not authentic. Probably not the movie that will give you thrills non-stop, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be mentioned well. And like a lot of creature movies, it ends with an extremely large number of bodies. It also has plenty of good jungle landscapes. The action is below the hair but it expected to be better, right? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than its recent American counterpart, "Primeival," but it's not to be compared with "Jaws". But remember that you may not engage in a few points.
