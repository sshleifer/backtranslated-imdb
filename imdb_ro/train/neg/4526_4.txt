Rather a mad attempt at a Hitchcock mystery-type thriller, unlikely to change spy for archeology and based on Robin Cook's novel; among other things, I recently recovered another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of director Richard Widmark. Fortunately, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - a similar but more exciting supporter, and unfortunately SPHINX was a fake step from which his impressive career will not return. Despite its sphere of action and reasonable distribution, however, it turned out to be a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the narrative is not even thrilling: in fact, it is quite terrible ( Weak attempts to horror - the archaeological heroine to support with spins, rotten rotten rot, even a butterfly attack - in spite of). Lesley Anne-Down is the most beautiful lady who opposes a lost treasure - in fact, she was hidden by a local sect to prevent her from falling into the hands of foreigners who have mastered much of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture) too a long time. Sir John Gielgud returns to an original evil as the ancient dealer who puts down the prey and pays for this "betrayal" of his life. Typically, it turns out that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, whom I I saw London in early 2007 in "Frost / Nixon," which now became a movie) goes from Down's antagonist to her boyfriend and again, while deciding to keep the wealth of the great Egyptian priest Menephta a national treasure.
