I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was a rupture of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly." <br /> <br /> The main character is a girl who is dressed in a place where she does not belong. The whole place hates and to make things worse, there is a hot guy who apparently does not like (well, you can not damn the whole school support). Amazingly, she finds a way to fit and make everyone enjoy plus, makes the guy fall on her heel in love with her. Then comes the choice, where he has to choose between skating and hockey. She chooses hockey, then goes to the chimps and is in the Olympic team. No real surprise there. The entire movie was so predictable. You know what will happen before you see it. This was so terrible that I almost caught up, and when I finished watching him, I had a terrible headache and the need to shoot me because I was watching such shit. Do not look at it unless you are under ten years of age or you really like horror movies.
