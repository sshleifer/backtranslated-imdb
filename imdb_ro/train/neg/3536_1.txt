I do not think I ever felt that before a movie. After I loved Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I do not call Swept Away - a blind pussy), I look forward to seeing this. <br /> <br /> The comments were weak, then again, I do not trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the internet pocket was that it was a bit stressed, so I was afraid to surrender the sum of Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. I will not even try to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what was going on and at some point I was almost honest to stand up and wonder if I just did not get it! Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking too much seriously. Apparently it was not enough for him to make movies with good plots, laughs, quick and good character dialogue. It's almost as if he had a list of movies he wanted to destroy, here are some of the things I noticed: Matrix, Wrestling Club, Kill Bill, Ordinary Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... I think the most frustrating thing is that the performance of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually really good and they were really the story of self-indulgence and editing / direction that leaves the film down. <br /> <br /> So a big, big thumb from me.
