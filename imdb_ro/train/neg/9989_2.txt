I had the misfortune to track this trash on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, because most are just garbage. This is even worse: it's one of the dumbest pieces of nonsense I've ever seen in my whole life. Horror movie? Yes, there are horrible things in this genre: the act, the script, and the special effects - God, I laughed at this absurd attempt to make a 90-minute shot. Actually, if it was a comic strip, I'd give it to you. 5. You do not think of renting it unless you want to be proud of the producers. Vote: 2 out of 10 - I did not vote because they made me laugh all the time ;-)
