Deep Shock behaves like a TV movie: a whole bunch of commercially-acting actors, a badly conceived creature to be the "bad guy," and a more technical, political and importance jargon than he knows what to do. I checked the movie because of the creature (I like to see what movies have in mind for their drawings in these films made inexpensive), and even on bats, I was disappointed that the creature on the box was not the one in the movie. The actors we've been waiting for because of the type of movie is (really quite generic and do not think of a certain point). Music was a typical symphonic music that was not thought out. I liked the design of computers and technical equipment along with the mini-sub design. The movie really went very well, with guiding screens that let you know what set you're watching the story unfolds. But it's not a big story here anyway. This movie gets a 3/10 star IMO. The boring quest and destruction of the mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures that protect it ... kind of blades. Even lamer is the love affair between two of the characters you do not see. Believe it in this movie until it's a movie that tries to get the career of the actors on the bench and make a movie. Not disturb.
