"It had to be you" is another sign that Hollywood has no ideas. This image refers to Charlie Hudson, a former police officer turned into the Author. When Charlie's fianc√© comes out of town, he gets stuck with all the planning of the wedding. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn as a teacher who also meets her. The two soon become friends and are preparing to plan their separate weddings together. When the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie destroys any romantic comedy ever made and just waiting for the end of the movie to do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge offer very mediocre performances, making this film more and more careful to look.
