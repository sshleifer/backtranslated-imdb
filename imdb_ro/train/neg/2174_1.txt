It's hard to believe that people really ARE! I think kids can enjoy it, but for me it is the kind of film parents that kids can not stand to stand for. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst child actor of all time. I will give the director some responsibility for the child, but it was really painful to look at her. I feel embarrassed for her now, knowing she is her. When he played the Star Spangled banner, I had to stop the sound - then I came here and discovered that they did that because he won Star Search. I've always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade with the name of his wonderful brother, sadly missed, and this shit shows why. Zero stars.
