Geez, as a gay man who lives in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the underestimation of the homosexual culture that is presented in this movie - and I'm glad of it! This movie was broadcast on television in the United States, it would be a big anti-Gay reaction and I can not say I blame them. The people in this film are not the average of Gay Americans or even the American media Trandgender, which represents them is a nightmare and a total nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is terrible, and obvious (anti-white) feelings are blatant and unsettling - society can not be accused of drug users, unemployment and the rejection of education from the "tower" of the film - the actions of these people they are not acts of despair, but rather a rejection of anything that resembles personal ambition and the desire to do something of its own.
