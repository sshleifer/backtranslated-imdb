Okay, okay. As good as John Carpenter's first season in "Masters of Horror", this is the opposite. He certainly proved he was still a horror master with "Cigarette Burns," but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen from him. It is stupid, absolutely free from scary atmosphere and tension and is known to be welcome, despite the operating time of less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and inapplicable, and the conclusion is beyond the absurd. And for those suckers who bought the DVD (one of them being me); did you see how Carpenter describes the movie? He is actually proud of him and he is talking about him as the best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And in the commentary, where he notices an obvious shock that he did before the final cut, he just says he did not feel it was essential to rectify the mistake and he let it be there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost touch. I sincerely hope I'm wrong. I want to leave a positive note and say that the effects of the creature are wonderful. From a technical point of view, this movie has a top note with efficient lighting systems and add-on effects.
