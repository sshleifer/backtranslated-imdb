I saw the movie last night after a lot of good reviews from several sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try and continue to work permanently who it is and which means all that means you will hate this movie. I still struggle to understand the actors' roles in this movie, the movie jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathize with any of your roles. For the police and those interested in corruption in other governments of the world, this movie is probably pretty good, but for the average visionary film this movie is weird, very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you have paid the entrance fee. see if your ready to focus 100% at every minute detail or policy you are interested in. you do not see it if you want to watch movies.
