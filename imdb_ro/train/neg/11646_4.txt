Kojak meets the Mafia. Telly Savales is one of the guys in the past who seems quite forgetful. I never thought his show was so great. This is his unique characterization of a crime boss with very predictable results. If you go to tracking cars and general defeat, there is not much development or action. It seems to me that the movies of the mafia are boring because I have no respect or interest in the criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case also the Italian cinema, treats these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I will not remember much about it. A lot of shooting, innocent people dying, treachery and sick loyalty. The film is photographed pretty well and the act is decent. But doubling is so bad (because of voices that simply could not get out of those bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla to approach the bay.
