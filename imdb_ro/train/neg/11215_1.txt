Well, at first, this movie looked pretty good, even if it moved fast enough and even if it had only a $ 60,000 budget, it was good, but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who could he kill her why you go to him tracing around and drag a gun on him with a single bullet and waste and end him running away from him all late and kill you? Besides, after you found your sister dead in the lake and you found a clue and you figure out who the killer was, why would not you give that idea to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she behaves like a sister who was a waitress and she talks to the bad guy, she should meet him somewhere and record him saying she died and what happened to her "proof". I do not know I did not enjoy the end. This movie could be much better if it took longer and the act was better and if the end did not suck so bad! Do not waste money on this movie, because if you do, you will write a review here and you will not be happy.
