Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, is supposed to be based on the Japanese television show that began in the 1970s. Now as a fan of Japanese movies and series of action, you would think I would get a shot from this show . You could not be worse. What worked in the Japanese version became a complete abomination of television with powerful powers of power rank in morphine. The MMPR is based on five teenagers who have the power to become superheroes dressed with robotic dinosaurs that form an even larger robot. <br /> <br /> Now this premise is much more fun and ridiculous than anything in Transformers, however, the ridiculousness of this show is often neglected. It was followed by two bad, and I mean, really bad movie blows, and the actors who played in this series, completely disappeared from the scene. If you have to choose, try to watch the Zyuranger series in Japan instead. > <br /> What's happening with the big cuts of the 1990s and all the earrings on the boys? It makes everyone look feminine!
