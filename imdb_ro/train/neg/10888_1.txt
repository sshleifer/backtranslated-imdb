This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story is not close, the characters are full of stereotypes, and Special-FX makes you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this film is the guest appearance of Rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. If this movie had to be a comedy, I could not understand. If you want to watch this movie: please get drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. But if you like the garbage films made on the cheap film: this movie needs to see you.
