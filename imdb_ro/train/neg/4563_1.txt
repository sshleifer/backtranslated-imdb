This movie is probably the cheapest, poorest and poorest sequel ever made. However, it is the funniest and most idiotic Disney movie and will guarantee laughs at sappy stories and blades plots from the beginning finish. It's a group of short stories that seem to be bad fantasies. The first of these is all about Beast and Belle being small on a pathetic argument. Then three lost characters decide to make their bed by making a letter of forgiveness to give Belle. In part, through this little episode, Belle has the wall eyes that made my brothers and I laugh so loudly. Then she and the Beast fight more on the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Of course it is big enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. Then the next is Lumiere being the biggest dose in the world when it comes to romance. This came from the man who could make any woman. And I'm making FiFi a psychotic madness trying to kill Belle and ending out of scotch to the end. What message to send children! Then the following is all about Mrs Potts being involved. And the next one is all about Beast becoming too possessed by a bird, to the point where it just seems stupid. The animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 mistakes you can see clearly ... and the coloring is terrible. Belle is a simulating seed that goes crazy whenever something goes wrong. In addition, she is small and very different from the usual Belle. And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are fighting almost all the time.) I know they did that in the movie, but it was exaggerated to do that.) But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. It's ruined in this. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see yourself. <br /> <br /> I give a 1/10 for digging, but I give it a 10/10 for comedy.
