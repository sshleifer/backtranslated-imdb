"The Vampire Bat" is definitely of interest, being one of the first horror movies of the 1930s, but taken separately, everything is a bit too crafty for any authentic praise. The film is set in a European village in the nineteenth century, where a number of crimes are attributed to vampirism by suspected natives. There is a sensation very similar to James Whale's "Frankenstein," and this is amplified by the introduction of Dr. Niemann's character by Lionel Atwill, complemented by his misguided ideas of scientific advancement. The theme of the vampires is arbitrary and only used as a red herring, suspected of collapsing in the sense of Herman (Dwight Frye), giving him an apology for a crowd that acts by torches to go on the ramp - as if they needed one. /> This is one of the early horror movie trios in which Luna Atwill and Fay Wray played together (and "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Museum of Wax") and, like other collaborations, the film suffers bad comic relief and the tendency to deviate from the horror of the elements of the mainstream thriller. Taken in context, however, "The Vampire Bat" is still weak and derivative. All that remains is an imitation of poor quality Frankenstein, with vampire elements simply a device for Dracula fans. But for the title, the film would have been considered a horror, and it is noteworthy that director Frank Strayer made the Blondie movies a few years later.
