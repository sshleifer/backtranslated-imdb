Songwriter Robert Taylor (like Terry) is "dizzy, full of happiness" and can not be seen directly over the other Norma Shearer (like Consuelo). "He makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," explains Mr. Taylor. But Mr. Taylor gets a piece in his neck whenever he comes close to Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at the frequency of Shearer's Palm Beach Casino, Taylor proclaims "I Love You!" The wiper removes him, being engaged with George Sanders (like Tony). However, in order to solve a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to act like his "card lover" to make Mr. Sanders jealous. The title of this film invites the obvious and appropriate review in three words: Cardboard. "It is most notable that the latest film appearance for Shearer, one of the greatest stars in the world in" He Who Gets Slapped "(1924, singing another Consuelo) to "The Women" (1939) To be fair, this was probably a kind of MGM movie filmed by the audience she wanted to see. was better in "The Escape" (1940) .If Shearer had continued, she could have become a better actress than the "leading lady," apparently she was no longer interested, and certainly did not need money. Taylor has an extraordinary scene reciting Christina Rossetti's "When I'm Dead, My Dear," while threatening to jump off George Cukor's Shearer's Balcony. **** Her Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Sugar ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
