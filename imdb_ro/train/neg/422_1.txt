A lot of death happens in the wild. You do not have to be rocket scientist to figure out! But must it be the center of a documentary of nature? What is this fascination with terrible death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn by pieces of lion hungry? Or, a cheetah caught a slow-moving neck gazelle, no less! I thought it would be a family-friendly movie! <br /> <br /> And why do not you have the courage to show the terrible violence in the trailers of the movie? If anyone was afraid to lose money? Then, in the usual way of relief, we see that the magnificent Paradise Birds fulfill the mating rituals at the most annoying and ill-nasty narrative from a human point of view. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers thought they only approached a room of first- and second-class students on a school trip! Wow! From mid to moronic in a heartbeat! If there is any future cineretic documentary waiting in the wings to read this review of the movie, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; eggs; bathroom; sleep; mutual cleansing; socialization; game; emotional impressions other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors such as mouthwashing; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what people call culture); communication skills; parents, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop concentrating on violence or destroying beauty, and why not be more rounded - and focus rather on delight and inspiration?
