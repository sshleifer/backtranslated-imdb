When I first saw this movie, I quickly noticed the actress playing Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely terrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. Thinking of a legend as Lucille Ball being portrayed as it was in the movie is terrible. I can not believe that of all the actresses in the world who could play Lucy much better, the producers decided to bring Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing Lucille Ball is hard. It's hard to find someone who looks like Lucille Ball, but at least he would find someone a little like the look and the talent. If you've noticed York's portrait of Lucy in I Love Lucy's episodes, such as the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way - her expression, her voice or her movement. In addition, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. It is small and weak, its emphasis is unreal and, again, its acting is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not alike, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. Generally, the extremely horrible casting and the story is bad. If people want to understand the real-life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest you watch A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read Lucille Ball or American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before laughing" would be a better choice. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before Laughter" is much better than that. At least, a similar look is shown rather than nothing.
