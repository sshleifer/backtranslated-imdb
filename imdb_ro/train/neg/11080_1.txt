You have to like low budget movies. It comes complete with bad effects, props and bad action (very bad). In addition, every time I see Mercedes McNab (sister), I still think "Be careful, it's a vamp!" - for those who know Buffy / Angel. A perfect example of what happens when someone stupid and wants to lose money by making a move, the little one of course. I do not know if I'm worse about the writer of the movie or the producer who did not recover money. I would say it's good for small children in their simplicity, but I do not know if I'd like to submit a baby ... 1/10 because that's the smallest thing she's going to do.
