The basic prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and history in Vienna. Get a genius I know you did not read, describe it as dementia, include crazy doctors to cure him, a couple of women somewhat well, play the role of an actor with a huge mustache, each character speak with the strongest accent , shows ridiculous dreams, includes another prestigious character that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mentioning a few words used in genius works, all that can be exaggerated, especially music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
