Jean Rollin nonsens artistically about vampires, strangers and the search for immortality. Women are beautiful and the amazing photo. The dialog is new. It's a ridiculous mess. It's great to look, but like any horror movie or thriller. I'm trying to figure out whether we should be scared or not. At the same time, is it put on or not? It's a weird mix of art and horror film that never matches your eyes, and while the nice look at it does not seem to mean anything, and in no way scary, even if the casual shooting or sequence creates a moment of frisson. pretentious. Something to be left in the background as wallpaper for those who like naked women.
