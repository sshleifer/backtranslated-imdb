This movie was so badly written. Characters did not have depth. He should never have made a movie about it. My 11 year old son could write a better script than Hyungrae Shim. The only actor who did not suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and credible one of the batch. I like movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it was up there on my list of blades at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. For those of you who thought it was a good movie, you need a major surgery. Most of the creatures in the movie were "not even dragons ... Why did they call D-war?
