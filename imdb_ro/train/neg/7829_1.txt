The early 1990s brought many independent quirky and off-beat films, of which a sub-genre is the semi-spiritual desert film. Others are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and "Natural Born Killers" to some extent. Good movies, such as those that gave birth to junk, such as "666 Highway", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this anti-masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It is a comedy that follows a certain emotional tone, touches it, but continues to the point of irritation. While pursuing the spiritual world of the desert and pouring Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or rough enough to be a good film and not enough focused on laughing to really be a comedy . I'm not gonna end the end, but just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of the cancer genre. These are the drains of indie-mania.
