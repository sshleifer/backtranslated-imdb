The title should have walked. The guy spends 90% of the movie walking. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life steals the identity of peoples for nothing. He does not receive any benefit, no money, nothing pretends to be another person. No body was able to understand why she claimed to be someone else. The only thing that was clear in this movie is that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest was nonsense. Can be director is a free who would like to be someone else. But what he should do is get a real job, because after his film I do not think he has the chance to get involved in film production.
