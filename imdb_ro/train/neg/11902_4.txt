The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he has difficulty finding a distributor in the US because most of those who saw him could not reconcile apparently conflicting messages of Christianity and American gear. The thought of seeing this movie as a religious film is, in any case, ridiculous. Because a minister in a mission prays with the homeless or wants someone "Godspeed", this movie makes him a "Christian"? One might interpret the fact that it is actually a mockery of religion in the "Plenary Land", with all its material excess, the best thing an organized mission can do is to give a bowl of soup and a verse of the Bible . A lot of unfortunate or spoiled? A lot of homeless homeless missions? How about a lot of psychotherapists in Vietnam? As a delusional survivor of the "pink" agent, must we believe that America is a "Land of Plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Of course, we do not have enough people preoccupied with Palestine politics based on the phone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you worked in a homeless German shelter, the unfortunate would be more concerned with peace in a distant country than their personal survival, because the world knows how Europe is the "Continent of many" when it comes to sophistication. /> <br /> Indeed, I finally agreed with the title, because the United States is "Land of Plenty," and in this case it refers to the abundance of poor writing, amateur actors and films directed still. Life is too short, and one, even American, does not have much time to lose sight of the song.
