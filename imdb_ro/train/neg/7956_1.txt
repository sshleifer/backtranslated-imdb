This movie should be number one on the bottom 100. The actor is so horrible that when I saw her with my son I was almost physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on and how bad it is, but all I wanted to do was add a warning to Frankbrook's review because I do not see that nobody else has gone through the trouble of doing so yet. Do not waste time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank you, I saw her on TV, so I did not spend anything. If I were, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and to have to exalt in their general direction. In conclusion, I'd like to say that I always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher's act. But I am sad to say that it is not worth watching in this movie. Do not spoil your opinion about Carrie on it.
