"P" (or Club-P) should really be called "L" for blades. Each festival has a disappointment and it is this one who fails to live up to its engagement line: "Thai lesbians fighting against monsters." Rather, this is the story of a Khmer country girl who was her grandfather taught a little witchcraft along with some strange (but specific) rules: "do not walk under a line of clothing," "do not eat cruel meat," and "do not accept money for your powers." Well, guess what I'm doing, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money like a "bar-girl" and manages to break all the rules a grandmother has learned, which then releases a bad spirit that kills in a way convenient "foreign john". While this film can not be released in Thailand itself due to controversial topics, most American audiences will find this horror ho-hum a cross between "Showgirls" and "Vampire Interview" according to Walt Disney's direction. If not for some scenarios with significant amounts of blood, the MPAA might probably only estimate this for adolescents. There is an adult television show, although you expect at least one sex scene, considering that the movie is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a real Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> Regarding the "lesbian" angle, there is a short blow and a few "I love you" to prove that the two main stars are really a couple (on the brother). And P bar should be the only exotic dance club on the planet, where the girls keep their sarongs and do carnival stunts (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers from a girl's mouth ... ooh, fake images). <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOVE, NOT real monster (unless you count a Thai-yellow spirit with yellow eyes) and no kind of ADULT should pay to see this kind of silly except DVD acquis. You have been warned!
