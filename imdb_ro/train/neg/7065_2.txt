Ok well i found this movie in my band tattoos old movies and it looked pretty good from the cap but the movie actually sucked !! OK, the first swim story was pretty good, but it took some time to get in, then the boy was completely retarded! He was not even scary! His dream sounds like a baby's story. Then the news girls were completely retarded. I'm sure someone will call the type of news and ask them to come out with you. But that ended with cold if she stabbed her and she was in the hospital and she saw the t.v and he said all that junk to her. Then it was that pretty homosexual story about the guy who brought the dead back ... The GMO is so stupid I will not say anything about it. The last one was the best. It was not that scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cold ... yes, yes, the little girl gets possessed and kills all her classmates or something. Then, when they all finish by telling each other's dreams, the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people in their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
