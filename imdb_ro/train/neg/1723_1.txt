Dude, what a scam it turned out to be! Not because it was not a good thing (because I did not really expect anything from him) but because I was mistaken for the DVD sleeve, which remarkably seemed to be "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the film, much less in their rest! As it turns out, the only film linking these three actors is equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)? but what about THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anyone's assumption? <br /> <br /> Even so, since I paid $ 1.50 for her rent and I was in a state of monster-movie anyway, I chose to watch the movie indifferent and, yup, she stunk! Besides having an unnamed distribution and an anonymous team, unmistakable amateur air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laughing at JAWS claims and, in a way intentionally, to the antic resistance of two moronic owners - such as men, who frequently quarrel with a confused local sheriff. The creature itself? a plesiosaur ie half dinosaur / half fish ?? (naturally), but, as was the case with The GIANT CLAW (1957) that I just saw, it did not seem to bother any film maker as it showed how much I can , especially during the second half of the movie!
