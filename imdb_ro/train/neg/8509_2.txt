I have seen this film for several reasons, the main being Mira Sorvino. With her on cast she could not be that bad. And she even seemed to have some mystery, and Olivier Martinez was her friend at the time, and she was pretty good at "Unfaithful". The story is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic entertainment movie with one of my favorite actresses. If you think of the same thing, let me warn you: this is a really terrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. The story is controversial with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative. They're trying to build a slash / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but it's not terrible. Heroes have no credibility, and the so-called investigation does not go anywhere. Characters are thin paper! Nobody cared about me. Moreover, they are irritating and quite ugly people. The act is atrocious. Mira's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! It keeps a dignity! Her character was weak, but it is not an excuse for such terrible performance. It seems to be the sleepwalking of the whole movie. I'm thinking about that, in fact I think I have seen my eyes slowly in some scenes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at a skin try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And that accent? My God ... Olivier Martinez is even worse. It's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. I'm sorry but I can not. I've suffered enough with this trash. This movie is depressing! It is so bad in every respect, it is a miracle as it was done. A bad team to produce a bad script and make some money over the actor's name. You do not fall for that. Avoid it! <br /> <br />
