As an army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who fought in the Vietnam War. Let's say that the real SF soldiers who knew they were offended by this stupidity are an understatement. If the movie were presented as a satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously by many people, especially abroad. Unfortunately, as it sounds, wherever I went to Europe in the late 1980s, people seem to judge me and the Americans in general through this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosillabic creature, mosquito-bound, is pulled by a prison band to go on a secret mission to South Asia to release some American rifles. In an ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never drips out of the ammunition and overheats. And never lose, running a 32-pound pistol with an arm. I can go on, but I have a headache. I gave it only 2/10 because it is a bit better than Rambo III.
