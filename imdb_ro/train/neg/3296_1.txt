The movie movie of some old television shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood nowadays, but this disrespectful humor, toilet, mouth-to-your-mother-with-mother, all fans Dukes of Hazzard , both to the north and south of the Mason-Dixon line. From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a month-long run for Uncle Jesse (without shining the show because he would put the boys back in jail as a password violation) to Uncle Jesse's closure smoked with the governor of Georgia (uncle Jesse's moral compass, despite his previous ways of moonshining), this disappointing loss of the film is an open insult. I can not tell you how many parents I saw raising children in the theater in the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized they were misleadingly horrible. The original Hazzard duke was a family show with basic moral values. The Hazzard Duke's original was a safe child fed by Hemi, a fun show that parents did not have to worry about handing over their seven words to George Carlin. I read reviews saying that the show and the film are nothing but racist. These committees may be correct about the movie. These committees are absolutely incorrect on the show. The show, if anything, was about getting along and being friends with anyone. Hollywood finally came out of their contempt for those of us, Yankee, Rebel or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and do the right things, even if it's not a thing popular. Hollywood finally came to the conviction that those of us in the heart are fools, uncoiled, beer, dirty mouth, garbage that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell. Prove to the Hollywood elitist that I'm wrong. Do not get out of this movie. Boycott sponsors. Fill Warner Bros. emails and carts with complaints that we do not appreciate destroying one of the biggest TV shows ever. Save your money and buy the original DVD, but what are you doing? Do not get out of this movie
