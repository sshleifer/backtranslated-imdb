Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not ruled out. I'll try to make this tone. Be real! No one wants to see a Chuck Norris movie where HE is not the main character. There was a good fight scene at the end, but the rest of the movie broke down. I have to wonder if the old Chuck can not stay with the best. Has he slowed so much that he must realize this and say that his reputation will last for the entire length of the movie? Chuck is a wonderful martial artist and, as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine both qualities in his movies, and that's not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, you're the main character in your movies, because that's not working for you ... Gary
