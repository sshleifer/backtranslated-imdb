Suggesting not less of a version of "Love, American Style" released in the 1970s, taken out of nudity blobs, "Superchick" (1973) is a piece of fluff that somehow manages to have fun. And the main character here, Country B. True, really is a kind of superchick. A stewardess (not a flight attendant) who looks so well that her autopilot pilot has made a move to her (!), And with a lover in any port, this wing, "swingin 'gal really puts" in "stationary". What her germaphobe surgeon is drinking in New York with her Miami gangster playboy, and her father from the creative rock provoked in LA, Tara keeps her occupation. And when he does not get these boys out of all their male energies, as the viewer teaches, she is able to take a karate class, clubbing miles high, defeat candles and rapists, attend parties and stop an attempt of hijacking on her plane. As I said, pleasant fun and, of course, good for a night in which you feel somewhat dead-brain and just want to get out in front of the tube. Future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings a fierce charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks nice enough to please you. Disappointingly, brother of Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (alias Candy Samples) are killed here in very small roles but still have to do what they do best - to show their stuff! Though the picture is never funny and does not have many thoughts in its metaphoric head, it manages to be constantly funny and I suppose it is something. Strange that the final credits should draw attention to Ms. Jillson's double body; do not you think we've seen this before!
