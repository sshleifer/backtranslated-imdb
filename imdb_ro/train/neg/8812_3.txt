Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought it would never end, would have been better if all the characters had been nuked in the first five minutes. Where's Blade when you need him? While as filthy as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as a nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not nearly as fun as any of the silent movies. While free cannibalism could make Jeffery Dalmers's heartbeat a bit faster, it was not as exciting as RAVENOUS. Indeed, I found it just as interesting as late night's infomercials, and as interesting as a trip to the dentist. If you have powerful masochistic qualities, you might be tempted to do it otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this was not done by the Brain Damage, as this was the quality of the dead creatures.
