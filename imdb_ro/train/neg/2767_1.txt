This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - surpassing the earlier terrible movie "Spawn of Slithis" that I saw when I was 10 years old. an affirmative, stupid and ridiculous dialogue, an incomprehensible plot, quake scenes, even music was annoying. Did I leave something? Well, the special effects were not bad - but CGI does not make a decent film. I can not believe I spent money to see this movie. If someone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the directory), send it to my user name "at gmail" and I will contact it to personally request a refund.
