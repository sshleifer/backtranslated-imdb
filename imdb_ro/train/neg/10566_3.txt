While I was considered a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak beginning. Although many of the elements that later mature and become more convincing in series are there, the rhythm of the gathering is slow, the makeup is somewhat inappropriate, and the plot is confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the rating chart shows that many fans are willing to ignore these problems, I remember that Gathering almost stopped me, which quickly became a spectacular series.
