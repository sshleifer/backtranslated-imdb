If there was an odd reversed Oscar Academy Awards, this movie would win everything. He has all the gods, an excellent plot, extreme special effects associated with extremely good acting skills and, of course, in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world were reversed, but it is not. Instead, it is the worst horror movie ever produced, not just the bad actors who seem to read the scriptures from a teleprinter with poor dyslexia but also extremely low special effects. For example, the devil's costume (which you must see) is one of the most hilarious we've ever seen. Whenever I saw that red-black monster on the screen, I could not laugh. And, at first, things seemed like a funny creature to be conveyed by a conveyor belt. Do not make the same mistake as me. Checking IMDB that the movie was released in 2003, it had less than five votes and thought: "Well, it's worth a shot, it can not be that bad." Yes, he could. /> <br /> I will not even lose more words on this movie.
