... but it will make you wonder if we have one in the first place! This movie is as bad as any horrible horrible today. A man walks around the semi-dressed ladies' mirror, trying to decide whom to kill so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. A scene involves a man who moves around the set for three minutes, covering everything that needs to be well over ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to create a feeling that what her friend's man does is also wrong against nature, but the movie is so badly done, it is impossible for the public to break down any sense of shock or indignation. Dark, unimpressive intimacy of sinister, this film can not even get its own title - the initial credits say "The brain that would not die," but the credits at the end of the list are "The head that would not die."
