At Hollywood, in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a western, apart from Warner's frogs. Sometimes I try, it's always ridiculous (except perhaps because they died with their boots - who is a western knight.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban throughout the twentieth century to be credible in a Western film. The story here had no surprise, and it did not help. Every 10 minutes, I think I see Bogart and Cagney throws his rifles and puts his hands in a machine gun to get rid of the set in a 1930s black car.
