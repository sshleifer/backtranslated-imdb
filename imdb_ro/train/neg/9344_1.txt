As the others have pointed out, this film is a burden of pretentious allusion to the mindless or the masochists. We all know that after seeing a train track and an acidic home, Scotland is one of the world's most depressing places in the world. But unlike trainspotting and house acid without a good dose of humor or realism movie stones like it does not work. Even more importantly, without a decent scenario a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspired or thought to provoke the script for this film. The fact that this film has won some of Bafta's shows shows how bad the British film industry is today. I thought the Aussie industry was bad enough today, but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. This movie is so bad that I would not even have bothered to rent it from the section of the week. > <br /> Make a favor and give it a wide picture.
