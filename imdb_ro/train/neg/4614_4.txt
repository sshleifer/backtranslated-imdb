It's great how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is absurd or because, given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it, it should be worth it, but because in every category in which it was nominated, Prizzi's City is disappointing. Some would argue that Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost him at this point in his career, but I do not buy it. Only the previous year he signed UNCER VOLCANO, a study of dark characters, placed in Mexico, which is among the best he ever did. The honor of the Prizzi family, on the other hand, a star-loaded movie, good intentions and a decent script, turns out to be an important br letdown. The general tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a woman-hit man prefigures eccentric crimedies that she caught in Hollywood by the storm in the early 90's, but the script is too tight for her sake, motivations are stopped and the whole story seems certain of what they are trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a sagas gangster, etc. Jack Nicholson (makes a Brooklyn accent, which works perfectly for Niro, but sounds unconvincing comes from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seem to be in the salary mode, just going through motions almost in their sleepwalking through certain parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand, better rates, but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivation: she begins the victim of her bigot's contempt, she turns out to be supporting her ex-husband, then becomes a vengeful bitch who wants his head on a plate. The colors of the film are of superior quality, as it was done in the early 1970s, and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as anything else. It's a promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a hungry director to be recognized that it could have been metamorphosed to something better, but what nobody's left does not look like a movie was really interested in doing.
