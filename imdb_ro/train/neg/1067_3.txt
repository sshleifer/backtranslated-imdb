Only a handful of segments engage here. A segment with a garage companion from Nigeria is ravaging. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point twisted by twisting until the final shot overlaps things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few clips invoke Paris. The others are so scattered about theme, tone, will, and production that you can also watch the "Best Years of Advertising, 2006." It's everywhere. It does not develop over its running time and nothing directs the directors. No construction joins the pieces successfully ... it prepares to multiply. It's about an hour, twenty minutes, and Elijah Wood is in something stupid - commercial, over-produced vampire. She has just as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitters in Antarctica. Show Fantasy I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank J & E for destroying another movie) and then make too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not need nonsense to make your extraordinary days. Why share them in the neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equal to vampires for a missed director? There has ever been a more represented genre than the vampire movie. Every three years we get the same blade vampires. Making matters worse is the fact that the transition from segment to segment is quite devoid of art. Transitions are lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels unhappy.
