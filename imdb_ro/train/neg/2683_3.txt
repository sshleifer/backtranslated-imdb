Have you ever wondered what would happen if some characters in Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is the expression Midnight Express for MTV. That would be okay, but the story was badly executed. Controversial controversy, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This poor film did not win the right to be as critical as it ends. The potential spooler and the impossible line of absolutism - the moment of sadness filled when the hotel employee discovers that the girls have no room there and is about to remove them. (This moment is played inadequately with the same solemnity and seriousness as the moment they are arrested with the gun). Later, the same employee of the hotel is somewhat found - and Bangkok is a big city, you think I was there - and confesses against girls as if a free couple Mai Tais is entitled to 40 years in prison . Come on. Rent another day in Paradise.
