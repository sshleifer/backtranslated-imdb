Anyone who studied any physical or cognitive science will be disgusted after 40 minutes, as did my wife. The ignorant masses could be cared for by the arguments of giving up the hand and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (even without a logical reasoning) of real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the writers took a quantum physics book, did not understand a word, then watched about a thousand times The Matrix and continued to write this film. For example, the Washington DC murder experiment was carried out by the transcendental meditation program. A short search will reveal the science of their methods.
