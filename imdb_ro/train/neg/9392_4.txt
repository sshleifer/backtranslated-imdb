Little Dorothy is moved back to Oz, who went to ruin and met old and new friends. Intense animation is blocked somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and less-inspired performances from Hanna-Barbera, although many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy's love "It's a far country far away," gloriously interpreted by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, so the movie is ruined whenever Dorothy is around. Much of this is great and I'm not even sure the boomers will get a tax from it because it has been removed from circulation for so long. As an element of curiosity, just right. ** from ****
