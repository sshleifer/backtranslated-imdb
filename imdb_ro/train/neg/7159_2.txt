I thought I would never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of Texas Massacre," but this film is competing with him. I'm not a person who falls asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up and started to see him agile. Why did I deserve? All the movie was a torture, I have to use it quickly to follow it completely. I can not stand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could have done this. I have to think that he has made the director a favor or even needs money, because the movie after the movie is destroyed; and so fast ... And about the movie? it's not a scary, stupid plot, the characters are terrible (but I really enjoyed playing Jared Harris), the effects are very weak, there are no deaths and blood, etc; in three words, he has something. And I mean. I can not stand how a director can make a movie like this. Anyway, when I was more disappointed it was when I saw in the film that the movie was presented by Stephen King, I think he could never show this crap, right? (We rented it to Argentina). I do not recommend this in a million years. I rate this movie with 2 out of 10. (As I'm saying in "The Return of Texas Chainsaw Massacre," it's always going to be a worse movie, so it's not worth 1 in 10)
