This movie makes me think the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie that claims to be more than a "b" movie. The act was so ridiculous that even memories of Combs' past triumphs in the past did not suffice to save it. Considering the scenario, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm very upset that I paid the prices for this garbage. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocities and, frankly, something that movies for the poor should be warned about. Avoid this movie no matter what.
