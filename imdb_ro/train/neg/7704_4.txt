Well, there is no real plot to talk about, it's just an excuse to show some extreme violence scenes and free sex (which can sometimes be fun, but it's not the case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive and there is a wonderful scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one that must be several kilometers tall), but generally not recommended "Kite". Take care if you want, but you do not miss too much if you jump on it ...
