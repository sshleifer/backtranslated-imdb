I do not buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for battle scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not the other way round. The story was decent, but it moved too slowly for my tastes. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre battle scenes throughout the entire period, which takes only a few minutes. The last fight was a bit longer, but until now I was so bored that I did not even pay attention.
