An amazing surprise of Larry Cohen (God told me that too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High tries so hard to be fun and fails at all, even with decent towers by Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars . Alan Arkin seems embarrassed during his performance, and Adam's son is simply numb. This makes Teen Wolf look like a classic comedy.
