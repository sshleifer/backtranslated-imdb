The Gold Disney cartoon was dead until the late 1990s. This Quack Pack show should not even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show had little to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenage Huey, Dewey, and Louie because they're making trouble for their uncle Donald and talking in lingo hip-hop and are completely dressed, unlike DuckTales. I prefer little adventurous grandchildren from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg, and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of humor of robbery, I recommend this. If you want a better show for Disney "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
