What a bad movie. I'm even surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like that. If you want to make a movie that involves baseball and show baseball scenes, make the action at least look somewhat realistic. Why was the crowd always standing without any special reason during the games? *** POSIBIL SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie ... what was that? We are led somehow to think that DeNiro has found his way on the ground in the uniform of an arbiter and that the game is even played in a heavy rain ... one of the worst scenes ever in a sports movie. 3 out of 10 stars.
