This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good. I read the first cover and waited for a good movie. Though it was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But no horror came to mind when watching the movie. It was a boring film, not really fun. Denise Richards' appearance was again a pleasure for the eyes. But that's it. We (the four of us) are a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this movie and judge it yourself.
