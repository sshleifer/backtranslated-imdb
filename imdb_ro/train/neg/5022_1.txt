Honey, this movie was bad for various reasons. I expected to see a very low score for this movie and was a little surprised by the total score. Sister, but to evaluate this as many have, it is a joke! Once you get through the movie movie Blue / Black and White, which was a nice idea, the movie is shooting, even at a running time of only 66 minutes. The sequence of credits at the beginning was so annoying! In the van, the boys suffer a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, which was needed in the story! How slow were the guys who tracked and managed to hurt Campbell? They do not seem to bother continue to drive away ... sigh ... I'm too happy to have this free with a special Dead Dead Edition!
