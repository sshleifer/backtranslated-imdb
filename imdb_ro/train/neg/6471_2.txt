This is a movie that is bad in all imaginable ways. Of course we like to know what happened 12 years since the last movie and it works at a certain level. But the new characters are not interesting. Baby Melody is terribly horrible! Unfortunately, while the logic that people can not keep underwater forever is maintained, other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cold unless you have cold clothing if you're in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here, Return of Jafar report worse, I thought this was more horrible.
