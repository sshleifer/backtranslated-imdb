Here we have two misunderstood children who have never had a chance against a cruel, impoverished existence: Robin Hoods was appointed by the police for persecution, because sometimes there were few savages. Gad! According to this shit, Bonnie was the smartest little thing to the west of Missouri, who was taught to be a psychopath killer by a fun loving lover who really did not want to hurt anyone ... just wanted things without to put too much energy into getting them. Wrong, poorly filmed, incredible dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, gore that seemed more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumb down. -5 stars.
