Tapeheads, a funny, intermittent, funny business music video, could have been a short comedy, and star John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortless in the crap of absurd chaos. In Los Angeles, two half-way security guards play their own company, Aces Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and a star with the deathbed. It is very unfortunate that filmmakers had to invent a small image to fill up their time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his puppets, who do not do much more than take the film's primary power, transmit music culture end of the 80s). However, Cusack and Robbins create a series of originals here: Poor, but free, strealist, without being sketchy or positives, these guys are at the same wavelength and never get out again. I'm the real thing in comedy friends. * 1/2 from ****
