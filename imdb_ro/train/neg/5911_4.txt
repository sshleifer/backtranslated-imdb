POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Spy Who Shagged Me is a much overrated and over-hyped sequel. The International Man of the Mysteries came directly from the blue. It was a lonely star that few people had heard of. But it was amazingly original, had sophisticated humor and ample humor, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant expression. Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercialized and more to publish. OK I admit, the first time I saw this movie I thought it was very funny, but it's only after seeing it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The actress was fine, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and was not nearly as good as that of Liz Hurley in the first. Those characters that flourished in the first (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are thrown into the background by hearing and not getting many stand-alone scenes. The movie is simply overtaken by the cams. Especially, I hated the way they totally ignored some IMOM scenes. When they killed Vanessa from the beginning and set Basil, he knew it was a femble over time. What was the purpose? They killed the number 2 in the first, and now I bring it back without any explanation. This should be a spy-spy, I do not think any of the characters even have a gun in the movie. It just goes on a runway, further away from the point. The new characters are very undesirable. The whole Mini-Me joke 'Fun to my size' is getting very aging. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for rude humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or remixed from IMOM. If this were the first movie of the show, then I would probably be easier on it. But the series started on a dry spirit and then dropped to a level of humor. So just say, just watch this movie if you have not seen your predecessor because The Spy Who Shagged Me is a final disappointment.
