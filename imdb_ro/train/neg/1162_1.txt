I went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. So far (I'm sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the most expensive movie I've ever seen. It simply went on without any point of discernment, and then - it just ended. The lights appeared and I watched everyone looking around in confusion. If the designer missed a coil? I never had the desire to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it was a drama about some college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the film was watching the audiences completely deceived. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
