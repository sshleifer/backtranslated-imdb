The first time I watched the Cold Case was after it was broadcast for a year on Danish television. At that time he came to television almost drowned in four or five other American crime shows broadcast at about the same time. I saw her and I was bored to death. The substandard actors with their faces and fearsome morals were a back pain. The whole premise that so much money was given to a team of investigators to solve the crimes of 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely. Time is also a factor because they have only 50 to 60 minutes to tell the story, which means they have gone through a break just to resolve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they I still live. This, combined with the "personal" problems of the relations between the investigators, who must have time to leave the show, is completely devoid of scope. I give her a 2-star rating because of the music and the end which is really the only reason you're watching it ... which you will not do, of course, because it's too bad to look at these crap.
