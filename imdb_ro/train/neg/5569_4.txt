I tried to really like this movie, indeed. In her viewing, all I can think of is, "This guy gave me creeps, I would have received a restraining order." Also called CAPEDENDENCE in capital letters. Was that really the conversation before doing the movie? "Let's make a film that puts two chronically inappropriate people, socially ineffective people into a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are." From what we have seen in life is that the last thing we find appealing in a potential partner is constant self-consistency. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is distinct 80-ish; horrified and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, very few of them.
