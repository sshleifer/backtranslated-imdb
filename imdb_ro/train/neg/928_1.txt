This movie is so terrible, it's hard to find the right words to describe it! At first the story is so ridiculous. A narrow person can write a better plot! The actors are boring and uninterested, maybe they were forced to play in that cheesy movie. Receptions of the National Forest room are the only good thing in this movie. I should feel ashamed, because I paid for this awful picture. We hope no one makes a sequel or makes a movie similar to such a bad story :-)
