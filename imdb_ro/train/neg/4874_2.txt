Too bad that neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say. this movie is just gentle. <br /> <br /> Film for children? If you try to give him a nap, then maybe. There are only 90 minutes of an animated lip animation with frightening eyes, which are not funny. And the synchronization of the lips makes old Godzilla films seem brilliantly made by comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy droneses with a suppressed suppressed delivery, which is painful to experience. Looks like he's trying to change his old maniacal character, but at what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version is lost in this re-imagination or whatever it is. A city wants to bomb some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. Not realy. And Pluto Nash can beat them. Things go with some old jokes to an uninspired boring conclusion without surprises. Rent the movie '67. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
