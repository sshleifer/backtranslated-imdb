Since Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was young, I was curious about her continuing. Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated feature of the highest quality, a great score and a general audience. On the contrary, Little Mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at young children because it is spontaneous, reflects a child's self-esteem, music is weaker and less dramatic, and the end feels like a niche. Mermaid 2 begins when Melody is introduced to Ariel's family. Suddenly, with no visual clue to help drama, a giant tentacle takes the baby. I laughed, I wait a minute, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Okay, I'm gonna quit laughing. Morgana's crime in the light of her day and spontaneity eliminates the potential of drama, since it has happened so quickly. Throughout the length of the melody, Melody seems superhumanist to defend, as most children imagine. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought to the end when he struggles with Morgana without an inch of fear on his face. Like the first movie, Melody has many Ariel problems except the reverse. Queen Ariel proves to be her father, restraining her from the ocean, while King Triton fences Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody are revolting against their parents. Music moves more emotionally in the first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but it was not an equally great orchestral work. It's great for the little ones, because it does not need an orchestra to impress them. The finish in the first film was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone plays in the water. It's definitely more child-oriented, because instead of ending solemnly and letting you blow, this end lets you think, "It's time for nights!" Finally, this movie is fun for the kids, so we should let them have fun.
