JESSICA: A STORY GHOST is as the name implies a ghost story. The theme is meant to be horror, but comes closer to comedy! A woman who comes brutally killed comes from the dead. This is what tries to make this film look like a plot. There is nothing more for her. The film is made up of a series of freely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before his death. Immediately from the opening scenes, this movie has the appearance of an "-DVD". Unlike stones such as VACANCY 2, the movie does not make sense of direction or creativity and certainly offers "straight-to-DVD" movies a bad name! The direction is as poor as a total lack of suspense, scare, or tension. Even dramatic elements are manipulated hopelessly and are somewhat more boring than even the worst telenovelectricity you've had the misfortune of sustaining. Actually everywhere is absolutely hollow without an actor involved showing even the slightest potential of a successful career. Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialog exchanges. I do not exaggerate! The only reason why I give this movie a rating of 2, rather than 1, is because some of the poor, combined with a worse dialogue for some unintended races. I emphasize the word "few" in this sentence. This is generally not one of the "so-bad-is-good" movies, such as CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a horror movie fit with the ghosts, watch the legend of HELL, CHANGELING, RINGU, OCHI (original Korean version), THE GRUDGE, A CALL MISSED or PHONE. whoever was lucky to avoid seeing JESSICA: GHOST STUDY to keep up the good pace! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not think about it!
