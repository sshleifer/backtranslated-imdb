My friends usually can sit with many hopeless movies, but this was too poor for us to see it all the way. He was just so boring and non-original. Even the "hot" girls who have played in this movie can not forget. Everything was just predictable and annoying. The actor was sometimes good ..... but worse often. The most annoying character in the movie you just wanted to die of should be the main characters the best friend. The more I've seen, the more I wanted to break my screen. (you know what nasty fat kid talk about) The land was done so many times before I think it should be sued by other film companies. OK, it's a good idea, but that's all this movie. Generally, this movie can only be watched if, by itself, to save any abuse from your friends. Or if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
