I was very disappointed with this movie. I was expecting more of a crime film from Thelma and Louise. Instead, the women in prison, who escaped in this film, had no sense of loyalty to each other. They were an extremely vulgar pack of hyena who beat each other, doubled, and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the movie. Instead of being wounded thieves, to plan their escape and to find the hidden money master, the escaped women were too selfish and vicious to trust each other for a long time. These women were not released in a positive sense. They just gotten a bunch of lost cannons, unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like 70 years of female crime, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, who sees Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
