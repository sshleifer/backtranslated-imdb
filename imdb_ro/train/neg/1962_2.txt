The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that anyone who did it could do a sequel. From the beginning to the end "The Fairy Tooth" was just impressive. It looked like a bad-action kid film that became confused with a Wizard of Oz who melts and happy children end up combined with some evil effects of gore and swearing. Half of the distribution seems completely useless unless it's convenient to be there to be killed in a certain manner. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise, the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have no point in the movie - they could have included them in the main compilation for some interesting stories, but they could not be disturbed. People watching the movie know that the characters are there for a bloody death scene, but they come, at least TRY and have an easy plot for them. The story is generally weak, with an irregular behavior on the part of the characters that makes you want everyone to be eaten by witches. Add the weak plot and the weak ones that act together (the children are mostly wood) and the film ends in complete failure. If only MST3K could have gone to this ...
