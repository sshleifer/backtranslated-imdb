It's hard to describe this - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer's movies this day, you'll be excited to see that Haji still looks very hot, though Forry Ackerman did not do that well to make these movies anyway ? If I go to him with a camera will be in my movie?). It was fun enough - a superhero whose huge mammals are his secret weapon - but sometimes it did not go out the full length and the jokes were on a level with the average comedy Joe E. Brown (or Abbott and Costello if that it's your thing) - basically just bad guesses. Still, we found this fascinating film to be tracked and for more than two reasons. A good job, but still a fundamentally thin production.
