I realized that several of Ben Stiller's films are or will be coming out this year, but maybe they should insist on quality, not quantity. I was amazed at what cinemas were thinking about comedy in "Along Came Polly." Stiller's reuben is detained without charm and is one of the worst performances of the year Stiller's style becomes he's undoubtedly a comic skill but he has to find another schtick or take a break to find a material that's actually funny because his movie goes from painfully from humor to aggressive evil There is no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, intelligent, promising career. As long as she continues to make more films like "The Good Girl" she's going to have a career she could be proud of. "Aniston desperately tries to overcome the material she's working with, but it's a daunting task for any actress. with Alec Baldwin, as the head of Reuben Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman, Reuben's best friend, Sandy, is nothing fun in this dreadful film. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's emphasis is not only stupid, but terribly unfortunate. The premise "Along Came Polly" has certainly shown a promise. Unfortunately, he needed a writer to turn him into a good comedy, instead of this lame, a boring excuse for a comedy.
