I did not expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what a stinker. Did I find this gem in a huge box of horrible DVDs of $ 5 at Walmart (where else)? So cheap this disc was, I feel broken. The special effects had a high school appearance, working with the tremendous tremendous camera and blurry illumination, and the act was a perfect example of the "Christian School". We can imagine long and exhausting "prayer meetings" by the production company, after seeing how the shame returned - those who have banalized this must have had serious antibiblical feelings about the inept production company that did this thing. Think of their pain because they saw that their investment of $ 914.86 increased in smoke. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - Xian filmmakers probably have to look at good movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. The stories and characters you believe, less hysterical and fanatic, and a story that addresses everyone - not just true believers. I.E. Stop Preaching, save it for the Church. Take the Omen or Prophecy series, for example. Excellent movies with compelling story lines, great cinema and intense music. It has no hysterical purpose. Without preaching. If this movie had a laughing track, it would have been much better.
