I try to be very objective when I see a low-budget movie. We also applied a lower share of independent productions and a low budget to large budget productions. I expect almost flawlessly from their large budget productions and their studios. Therefore, we have applied stricter criteria for major studios. But this movie was just a dud. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a senior senior high school student with an unwavering desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in her character or in her acting that dragged you into her world. Also, to make this movie more mysterious, illumination in certain scenes has not established mood, especially in the warehouse. Once again, another disappointing film that I could only give three points.
