Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song at the same time, they portray an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his unjust wife in the locker room, the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialogue, so you can not hear any sort of dilution of the emotional impact the scene can have. The scenes about which Annabella was beaten by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt was so drawn as absurd. The entire movie is a cartoon, the aggressive bias against white is literally amazing. The discussion of black women after the flipper's wife finds she cheated with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an Oxford discussion team, it's ridiculous. It is possible that racism is grieving, but the soundtrack and the mixing of sound during this film are too many. It was a poorly accomplished film. There is no understanding of the basic job of the film, the sound track, the editing and the desperate attempt of the great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. I'm sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he accepted a role in this move - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I've seen this director and this will be my last film.
