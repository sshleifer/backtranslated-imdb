I find it rather useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason why she has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that has nothing good to show the world to the fragment because it is rotten that other endless eggs have been before it. But because a commentary is obligatory for such an insignificant grandeur ... Filth is definitely the right word to describe this movie created in the same way as any other "Romanian" film directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists on describing the so-called "Romanian reality" after the communist era (1990 to the present day). Under no circumstances is it advisable to people from outside Romania as to the others (who have recently found amateur apparatus, lack of plot, lack of quality of the director / actors, etc., noise, etc., as being fashionable and even artistic): watch and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you), but do other well-intentioned members IMDb a favor, do not write an online review because it will lead you wrong, irritate and eventually waste your time. On the other hand, this film (among others) has some value, an educational one: "How not to make a movie."
