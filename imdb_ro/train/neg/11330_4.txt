"Giant" is one of the most boring, far too long materials against Hollywood. Many scenes seem fake and energyless. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this great Hollywood production. A central notion to this film that a farmer would ever resist oil drilling on the ground is absurd, and I know that because I'm from Houston. Several scenes, especially Dean that serve Taylor coffee, redeem this boring movie. For a more accurate and more interesting description of how modernism changed Texas farms, see Hud (one of Paul Newman's best performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
