this movie has no plot, no character development, and no budget. is very pleased to put it in the short term. Since there is no development for the film, it can not really be seen as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. Which leaves two other reasons to look at it. Be shocked or come down like a strange little sick man. Well, here it is not. The face's reactions seem to be bad. it's extremely easy to say it's fake (the professional honest fight looks more realistic than the crap they're trying to get in this movie.) She throws it on her, but she sleeps for most of her, so it's just dumbass. Indeed, an important part is the end when it cuts quickly from scene to scene even before the needle comes into the eye, but with sincerity the face is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly false, except for the eye. movie about torture, watch Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they contain realistic violence but there is also a real story that attracts you and makes you care about people. Plus trailer movies really work on a deeper level such as American fears of aliens, morality issues, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs. civilization and many other things. In addition, they are carefully written and contain good humor when the story is not focused on viiolence. These are far better choices for this piece of nonsense
