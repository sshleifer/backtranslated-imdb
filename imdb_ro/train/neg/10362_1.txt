Disney? What happened? I really want the movie to have been set in the 1960s, as was the book. And I really could have gotten some cheap special effects to save the budget for a more accurate adaptation ... I'm glad someone might be influenced to read the books ..... but the Red-eye-Man interchangeable like IT ? And what happens to the volcanic overthrow? Where was that in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I hope I can do it. I can only imagine that it could be closer to the real story than this poor adaptation. This movie must be X'd.
