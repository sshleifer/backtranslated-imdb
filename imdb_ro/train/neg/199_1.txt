This is a terrible movie, a terrible scenario, a bad direction and a nonsensical ending. Also, poor performance, with the exception of Clancy Brown, which is not used in a criminal way here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - do it to download enough bad movie karma to really see a good one down the line. The film features a father and son who show that they could not possibly have been linked. The part of masculine leadership is not well written and seems non-partisan in this role. You can see the parking points a mile away. The actions of the feminine leadership and that of her brother, the policeman, make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie does not make sense in the scene.
