I do not think a Van Damme movie will ever beat the universal soldier, but I never know. This movie was good, but not as good as the first. VD returns a Luc and must fight again. Try 2 b funny here, but maybe it's worth a giggle smile. VD has a kid this time from Ally W., well he showed a bit of them. 2. Goldberg was cool, he's making his famous move - he forgot what he called it because I do not watch wrestling-sucks. VD and Goldberg had some good battles. It was the end first, but not so good. VD makes the best move in his career, as always - KICK HELICOPTER. Even if the final end had to be longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it never goes beyond the original.
