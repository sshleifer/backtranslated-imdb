"Kids Like These" could have been a decent film, given the subject. But instead, it has become a media film last week under the media, without too much force. The action is obsolete, the predictable plot and the non-existent direction. For a better film on the same subject, try out the excellent movie "Le Huiti√®me Jour," a movie that deals with people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like These" they are simply used as an excuse for crying sentimentality. Pretty awful. 1/10
