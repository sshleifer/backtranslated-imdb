<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this. It has become a joke to himself. Once again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, applause to women, and a lot of attitude talking between characters and autumn pans. Everything for nothing. Because there is no action in this movie. She destroys all of her pieces. All actors give the kind of show in Verhoeven. In other words, it manifests on almost all levels. Starship Troopers stayed with him because it was a macho world, the characters inhabited. These scientists act in the same way. I'm sorry Paul, but the soldiers and the scientist are not really made of the same kind of mentality. One of the major flaws of the plot was that after escaping that night, doing bad things, Kevin Bacons' character is back to science where we've spent more time than watching these animated manicures (Elizabeth Shue exception) to speak and speak. Why not show the extent to which the character could do in the outside world. How could he track him if he could be anywhere? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of storytelling and characterization. Then look at what this movie does and even you how bad was done and the whole project was done it really was. More insulting is Doco on DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd Genius. Well, one in two is not that bad. This movie has nothing to record in it. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
