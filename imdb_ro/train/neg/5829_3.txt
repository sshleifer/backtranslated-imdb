I watched this movie as a preview of Matthew Barney's art exhibition. She's definitely preparing me. I almost skipped the exhibition and probably should have a retrospective. Besides the fact that the score was great (Bjork) and rich and colorful photography, the content was largely boring and predictable. Well, I had to see somebody wearing pearls to figure out what the pilgrims did. The film was largely a silly mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial photos of modern whaling technology being used in a bait / harvest hunt. The movie "peaks" with enough free shock to turn your stomach. What was the point of the movie? While others may claim to be an anti-whale, it can be equally supported that it also justifies balenation. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "move" the audience with his anal feces, feces, self-mutilation, and cannibalism. Bottom line: If you do not really give up on Barney's sense of art, do not bother to see this movie. The message is obscure, slow rhythm and demanding cultural references. If you go after the shock, you'll do better with one of the countless "Undead" movies or you'll hunt an old copy of Hustler and you'll have a fecal cartoon.
