There is absolutely no reason to waste your time on this "movie". The original said everything and still remains. Read either the book or do some research about the story, and you will realize that this remake is absurd. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! After being at Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story unfolds, sets and locations did NOT look like Kansas. The original is riveted, from shooting the location to the use of participants, weapons and objects of the victims. Unforgettable shows by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Quincy Jones Soundtrack and Conrad Hall Cinema ... The original is available on widescreen DVD now. Let the turkey die a quick death.
