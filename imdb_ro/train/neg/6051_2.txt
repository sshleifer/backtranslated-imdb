urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot, and a good cast. I saw the movie waiting for him to be horribly hilarious and unfortunately he was disappointed when he was simply terrible. I lost the will to live up to half. The only thing that prevented me from stabbing my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason I looked first). She did a good job like Rastus, and her appearance has not changed much since she was 13 years old. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both have done a wonderful job with such terrible material. Sandra Bernhard thinks it was the biggest mistake of the movie. she has been completely miscast, and I do not think she has ever had enough character. I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
