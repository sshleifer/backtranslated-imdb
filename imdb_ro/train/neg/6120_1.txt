there are three kinds of bad movies - cheap, boring and tasteless. the only very bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> The boring movies are just, well, boring - if you do not leave fast enough, you fall asleep. The tasteless movies actually have their defenders; but it remains that they are aids for masturbation for the very sick. only cheap movies are funny, because filmmakers wanted to make their films, skills and resources so desperate. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is simply boring and tasteless; fortunately, fate and lack of funds and abilities redeem it making it look cheap. this movie is hilarious and may be the last really funny-bad movie ever made. I saw this in a theater for the first time, maybe God forgives me; I'm so silly that I was twisting from my chair and also with most other auditors. It is clear that Derek and her husband's promoter conceived this film as part of a satire; unfortunately, the shortcomings obviously lacked all the resources needed to do so; Consequently, the "satirical" element is lost as the impression of a school girl about an impressed young man with a homosexual impression of gorshin sincerely about the trap in the batman trying to claim it is robin - does not fly over our head, has no idea where any the human head could be. On the other hand, there are some moments considered serious in this movie - it is supposed to be an action movie, remember - who are so amazingly brunettes, wondering if someone left my milk in my eye. As for Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine a nudity less erotic photographic display, it's so weird looking for those wide shoulders, Imagine what she has ever seen in her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - like - well, it is not; Derek watches around Africa, and God alone knows why. then her father - Harris - pretends to behave in a manic doll show and then, of course, there is hunk'o'Tarzan who seems to have asked himself out of advertising without knowing that the subject has changed - probably because he did not seen scenario - it seems that no one has worked. Negligible camera work, unconditioned editing - if it was not supposed to be with the chimpanzee, the film would be unbearable; <br /> <br /> as it is, is a real hoot.
