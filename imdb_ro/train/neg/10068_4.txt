A cowboy who sympathizes with the situation of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused of raping and killing the boss's daughter, leading to hatred and violence. This feature of crackpot nudity is fun to look at, though impossible to defend on any artistic level. The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white make it look more like a live cartoon than a serious production the press materials claim to be. In short, abundant nudity (the real reason to follow this) is good. Everything else is not. There are better examples for both genres. More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed in the infamous Spahn movie and has not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the murder box when he hit the screens colored with soda from Pussycat Theater!
