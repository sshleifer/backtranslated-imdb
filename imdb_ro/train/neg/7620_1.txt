I hired this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but for Horror, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I have read the commentary from Gumby-8 and he must be part of the distribution or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old or a demented worshiper, nobody in the right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all. I could not believe the opinion of Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> "From the animated opening animation" Dune "to the fast pace ... this movie keeps the eye on the move and works so well that repeated viewing is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was exciting and the film keeps eye on the move, well, that's because you keep searching for any kind of suspense. I want to say that giving me a Halloween break was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and also became a classic cult. Regarding "repeated viewing is not unexpected", I think she made a mistake. Another quote from Gumby-8, the only fan: "The actor is also a strong aspect of the movie." /> <br /> With all the respect for the actors, their performance is nothing but the talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> Tagline winners: "Beware of the hour between the evening and the dark" <br /> <br /> <br /> That's because there is no shower or dark in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA Assessment is the red paint on a sheet over a dead body that you never see. As far as I know, there might be a bunch of grass, in summary, I saw horror movements from The 50s, 60s and 70s I saw what seemed to me to be the worst and some who were very good The director of this film did not make any attempt, he was asleep or took a hit I think the actors deserve applause because they are trying to save a very bad direction. "I would give this film a rating of 5 for a" B "movie.
