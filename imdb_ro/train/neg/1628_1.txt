Undoubtedly one of the most embarrassing productions in the 1970s, GAOTS seems to be really, REALY wants to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is so totally worthless at every level that you can not laugh. Deprived of the earth elements in Ingmar Bergman's films, one day of a city couple in the wilderness ... walks on a shady path, all pontificating like a UC. Berkeley Coffee. Almost every Tarhadiddle dialogue line here is extremely bad ("I feel that life itself is made up of as many small compartments as this rhodium ... but is it just as nice?") After what seems to be a eternity of absolutely nothing (well ... Ok ... we are treated with nudity and a soft sex scene), there is finally a very anti-climatic confrontation involving a pair of veterans from Nam who are doing the scene of nature and interpreting some popular folk ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> There is nothing interesting or interesting about this movie. I thought that Larry Buchanan's image "Strawberry requires rain" was a weak example of Bergman's tribute. "Apples of gold" is just as bad, but the endless verbosity it presents makes it terribly awful. 1/10
