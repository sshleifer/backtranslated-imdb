Judging by some of the IMDB comments, I expected an action movie - maybe a dramatic or stupid one or a simple or a comic but essentially a action movie. Whatever one I looked at, certainly did not feel like a movie. The story is straightforward and straightforward (even if the prologue tries to make it look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. Now subtract the first (they never appear in the film). Then let one of the assassins, princess, become a dishonor on a revenge trip. Add a rebellious love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. But they have not yet turned it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and strange visions that try to be Sci-Fi at a low budget, what's left is a sense of emptiness. The film does not feel like a movie, but a strange, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
