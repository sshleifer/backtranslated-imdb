This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say again: This is the only single shot I've ever seen. He had all the signs of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad action, poor production value, bad music. I thought there were some points for horror movies. The first is that it should be pretty suspense to scare you. This movie also receives F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them, we should care. This movie also receives an F in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is struck by wolves after she fears it will happen to her. The next story, a TOC guy dying of not being careful and talking to a dead friend of his. Oh, and then it's the horrible, angular story of a bad roommate. Come on, can you choose more interesting and less common topics than being alone in the house, being anal-retentive and having a roommate? Displays all these stories in which hallucinations, the virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses himself. Wow, stupid. Let me explain something, I like to see the terrible bad movies and laugh at how bad I am. I could not do that with that. It was a total pain to sit and look. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. You'll regret.
