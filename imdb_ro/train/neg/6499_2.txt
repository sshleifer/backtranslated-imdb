What miserable misery. We have seen this with a friend a while ago and we both think we are open to the wonders of many cinemas, but this is not one of them. While there may well be some good ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under these circumstances), they are all buried under a random nonsense. Sir Anthony pulls too much of the same genetic pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar editing movies, or maybe he looked at Nixon for inspiration. Tell what you want about David Lynch, but at least he often has a way to madness. His quote to say he made the film as a joke tells everything. It's not worth the money, the bandwidth or the time.
