For two of the funniest comedians, the film was terrible. You moved it fast and you never had a better time! Lose Time and Lose Money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought it would be so great in comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the film. My husband even thought he was sucked for a chicken blow. What's up with this. The film was very slow and boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this moment. I would love the money for it! Leave us here in Arizona. Thank you, but thank you. Who does such stupid things for people to think you're pregnant. I thought it would be so funny that I had my own children and helped others have children. It could have been more like in reality.
