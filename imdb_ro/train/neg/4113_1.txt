I have to finish watching a movie once I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was agonizing to stay by. The "sparkling" bullets, the ninja movement reporter, the bad guys pulling hundreds and hundreds of bullets, and they seem to happen only with innocent victims, the predictable result and all bad reactions being just horrible. Like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends' apartment and goes from "what the hell are you doing here (taking a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%!" in 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your children (or dog)!
