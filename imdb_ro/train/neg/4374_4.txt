<br /> <br /> A Virgo's inputs are so bizarre and incomprehensible that they allow the spectator to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning he desires for unexplained excesses of sex and violence. If this were an intentional feature of the film, it would be a postmodern brilliance - but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without getting too much in the plot summary, let's take a quick tour of the events. At a secluded cabin, an orgy is underway, which includes topless combat and diaper. A delay wagon joins the orgy in progress, but they were followed without consent by a monster I like to call muddy ninja. This monster precedes killing orgy participants one by one, with the exception of the proverbial comma (if you do not count the oral sex) who receives his seed and, consequently, becomes so passionate about the desire to masturbate with someone's cut hand. Ultimately she has her courage removed, and then there is a scene that seems to mean she is pregnant with a nude nude nude. Do you have all this? If you want to rent this movie, it's better if you do not speak Japanese and you have no subtitles. In a season populated by boring films at Hollywood, placing it in VCR could be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. It will definitely be different.
