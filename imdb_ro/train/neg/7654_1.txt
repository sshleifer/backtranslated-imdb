I remember reading all the horrible and horrible reviews of this movie when it came out. I wanted to go see how horrible it was, but he left theaters in three weeks. The only other film he manages is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how terrible it was. I could not think of the horrible attention that this movie made. After seeing her, I understand. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that this movie is not without some great photos. There is a beautiful kick at first, showing that a bullet was pulled from inside the pistol, which I thought was clean. And how the monsters in this film die in some kind of coolness to look; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If the bad show was a sin, then Hell would have tormented Tara Reid as soon as it is so incredibly terrible in this movie is unthinkable. And in all its roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb toy with an empty head, then maybe I could forgive her for treating her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not realize that although he seemed to think that if he took his shirt in the movie, people would see it. She just did not realize that doing it in the middle of the movie at the wrong time just made the movie even more hilarious than bad. And is it a Mexican song or something during dry diving? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the most serious directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean I would give House of the Dead a F (and I do it for very few movies), but HotD would score at least one B compared to this junk of junk. The film begins with a very long story that causes immediate confusion (and read by a terrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are indeed really stupid. There is only one point where Slater and Reid look around a building that has been destroyed and the screen is blackened. When he returns, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly, an entire army joins. It is not like that? <br /> <br /> And someone would NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before it touches it. Tara Reid's shades change colors in the middle of a scene, and after Slater moves away from a dead companion, you see her start getting up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about an ancient tribe that releases darkness and someone "opens the way" or something, and all evil monsters spring up. It's just an excuse to have lots of weapons scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character needs to reload into this movie), which simply enriches itself. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie in the hope of laughing about how incredible it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's bad. Very, very, very stupid.
