Now that Che (2008) has finished the relatively short Australian cinema tour (extremely limited version: 1 screen in Sydney after 6 weeks), I can unceremoniously join both hosts of "At The Movies" in making the task of Steven Soderbergh. > <br /> We usually see that a film director is changing his style / subject, but Soderbergh's latest noise, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story, so the narrative (and editing ?) seem to be suddenly Soderbergh the main challenge. Strange, after 20 years in business. Perhaps he was never good at the narrative, he just hid it inside the "harsh" projects. Neither of them apologizes for this failure at present, almost diabolically. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not even make a whole." <br /> <br /> Epic biopic in name only, Che (2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! He certainly has no legs, as long as, except for his unusual later resolution, history, Soderbergh's 4.5-hour score does not go anywhere. Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving of the movie The At The Movies duo, remarked about Soderbergh's repeated waste of HD storage: "you are in the woods ... you are in the woods ... you are in the woods. . ". And I am surprised that Soderbergh has not given us another 2.5 hours THAT somewhere between the two parts, because he still left massive "revolutionary" life of Che! For a biopic of an important, but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh alienates unmistakably if he does not deliberately intend his audience with 1. <br /> <br /> never offered much of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. imposing unreasonable lengths of the film with a simple repetition; 3. ignoring both the true perspective and the narrative of the events; <br /> <br /> 4. Only develop an idea or character; <br /> <br /> 5. Remaining episodic claustrophobic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignoring the right context for scenes - whatever we do is stuck in destructive periods; <br /> <br /> 7. linguistically disentangling all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be confused with incongruent English exposures); and <br /> <br /> 8. Undoubtedly bringing the main subject into a single dimension. Why, at this late stage? The franchise shirt was a success! <br /> <br /> Our feeling of claustrophobia is certainly due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing his script exclusively on Guevara's memoirs. So, as a poor student who read only one of his assigned texts for his mission, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. The public is held captive under the same "revolutionary" constraints, landscapes and circumstances, but that does not give us sympathy. Instead, we're back, "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to beat his audience just like the Latin peasants at the time." But these are the same illiterate latin peasants who sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate with them and to keep our captives equally mentally? Such a straitjacketing of the public must have a purpose. Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally disturbing to mind, with bush-bashing repetition, perspective misery and lack of arcs of variety or character. Del Chero does not have the opportunity to grow up as a person as he struggles to educate his own undisciplined troops. The only problem is humor as Che deals with "revolutionaries" sometimes profoundly ignorant, some of them lacking violent self-control around local peasants or food. We certainly do not understand what caused the conditions and no strategic analysis of their guerrilla insurgency, as it was. Part2's countless countdown is afraid of an episode: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus, even scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disturbing. Any selected event is presented minimally and Latin-Centrally, Part 1 interviews being replaced by time-shifting meetings between Joaquim de Almeida and US government officials promising CIA intervention (!). the rest of Part2's "woods" and the blue night-time filter excite the audience until they look at the exits. Perhaps DelToro has felt too much frustration for many non-American Latins never to get a true and unambiguous history of Che's exploits in their countries. When foreign governments no longer offer a free press to their people - no matter what reason - then one can see how a popular American indie producer could have attracted those who were not so read ("able to read or write, but are not illiterate! "- cf. The Inspector General (1949)) at their own local cinemas. Film negligibility and too much simplifications strongly suggest that he only follows the less informed understandings of WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. If it had happened, they would have already read about the subject and criticized the relevant social issues between them - learning the lessons of history as they should. Such perspectives are precisely what societies still need - and not just the illiterate Latins left in Central and South America - yet Che Che (2008) fails to deliver. Soderbergh handles his leadership because he is weak of the narrative. I'm gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. It was 44 years old, and the retrospection about Guevara was very desirable: it's what we did to see this movie, but the director exclaims us so badly. David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009), noticed that while part 1 was "uneven", Part2 actually "goes down quickly" from there, "characterizing Che's final campaign in Bolivia , in exorcising details "," ... feels almost uncomfortable slow and turgid. " <br /> <br /> Che: Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly not a trip to Bolivia, painting being an image of misery and atavism. The entire half of the second half is redeemed only by the humor mentioned above and the dramatic - but tragic - capture and execution of the subject of the film. The rest of this truly endless cinema is just confusing - for a Soderbergh film, to be avoided at all costs. He is forced to break the hearts of all who know even a sense of the subject (2/10)
