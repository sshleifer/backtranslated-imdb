I always liked Fred MacMurray, and though her career was tragically shortened? I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Together with the two major and attractive stars, add supporting actors such as Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, giving them a romantic script, equipping them with director Mitchell Leisen and getting a cinematic experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet up cute" during his visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictable meteorically both in ascension and autumn. During his ascension to music, he neglects Maggie, who inspires him later to start after he hit the bottom of the rock. Oh, yes, it's true Hollywood's happy ending, which does not come too soon. Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to watch at times. The early scenes in Panama are so cute that they seem to go forever, and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole are trying everything they can, but the tired scenario and the S-L-O-W direction do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from alcohol ashes and disappointment, just does not sound true. This movie should be seen once to watch some early shows from MacMurray and Lombard stars. However, it guarantees you that it will take about 48 hours.
