About twenty minutes in this movie, I'm already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty dull. Occasionally, something will happen, but then things will slow again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded, and the ending of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was by no means good enough to justify the sitting in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film was mediocre overall, and considering all the talents in the cast, I would say it's a disappointment.
