I'm not going to talk to anyone who pronounces this movie, like Jan Jones's performance, but please check it out, if you have not already done so, in the AMC series "Mad Men" starting late this month. like the entire cast, I assume that it has taken the role of "taboo" strictly for money, and, realizing what misery it will be, has turned into a minimal job to avoid starvation. I know if it is, but I (now) know for sure it can act. At first, looking at taboo, I was convinced that her flat-rate delivery was a weird choice that would later give rise to a significant revelation of her character or plot There is no such luck Hard to believe that the director suggested at least once that not changing the phrase for 17 successive scenes could cause blockage. her winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character who, at least in her first appearances, is very repressed, reserved, uncertain of herself, and rather colorless, no different from her Tabu role. But as the TV series progressed, it began to bloom someone who doubted the role of her traditional mother in the early 1960s. I can not wait to see where she takes her character in Season 2. To summarize, avoid taboo as a leper, but surely check "Mad Men".
