This movie is very important because it suggested this consideration: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may want to have Goldfield syndrome ... this way , do not remember this boring movie ... and, above all, you did not remember Adam "superfluous" Sandler ... sometimes you just might like ... have rented another movie .. . <br /> <br /> My vote? 3 of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke there is no Adam Sandler's fan ... I want to hope), save yourself ... Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... may be.
