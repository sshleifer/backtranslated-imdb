One of the most disgusting films I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after seeing her. I saw this movie in my class of American history and the purpose was to see an incitement to the life of a Western farmer in the late 1800s. What we saw was pigs shot and then sacrificed, human birth, branding. Oh, and at the end a live calf was born and let me tell you that birth itself was not too bad, but the many fluids that came out led most of the classroom people to the bathroom. The story itself was fine. The premise of this story is a widow and her daughter and moves to the West to be a shepherd of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship, and it's a pretty accurate vision of Western life in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, you do not see this movie.
