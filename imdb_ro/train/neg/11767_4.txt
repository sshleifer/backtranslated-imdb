I had big hopes for that, because I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought this would have more than one bang to it. First of all, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. It looks like his eyebrows have been re-modeled for that. His performance was not convincing. It was not as good as we would have expected. Tim Roth is cool as always here. Gama's work did not really miss the line of original story I do not believe. I think the best part of the movie was the end. He had a cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not so long, but it is sometimes boring. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this very cheap sales movie and I always wondered why? Now I know. We were hoping to run, but I was not.
