"Sleeping With The Enemy" is a predictable, thriller "out there" that never seems to find any inspiration, no matter how desperate it is and the crew is trying. I can not believe that a bunch of friends told me to see this in movies about fourteen years ago. The complete lack of originality in Ronald Bass's script (based on the novel Nancy Price) does not help either Joseph Ruben's old direction or Julia Roberts's very average performance. Support support, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does not help much. There is not much to say. Give him a wish. Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center in Melbourne
