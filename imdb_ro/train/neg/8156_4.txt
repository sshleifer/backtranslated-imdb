Prom Night 2 is a horror movie OK, but the ballet promenade is much better and movies about how the protagonist Mary Lou of 1957 is murdered by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside, the film starring other actors and actresses like Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good scenes when Mary Lou kills the girl trying to hide in her locker by crushing the cupboards together and one of the students on the computer and Mary Lou electrocuted her to death. Everywhere this is a horror movie OK / good and my rating is 4 out of 10.
