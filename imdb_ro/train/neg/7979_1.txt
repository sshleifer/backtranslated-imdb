This movie was slow, but boring and acting often floated in the bacon country. Redgrave's character was untouched as a woman trying to compete with Thurman's 20 for the love of Fox's character (why is beyond me). The title of the film should have been "Gravel on the Lake". The actors played as if they were rehearsing. An extremely predictable ending at the end. I can not believe this site is a comedy on this site!
