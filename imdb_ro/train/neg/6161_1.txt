This is probably the worst guard, the fight against the sword, the movie ever made. This is not just because the so-called sports fencing is poor, but because of the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to throw in a semi-naked sexual scene and later involve group dances around a fence scene in the fence club trying, I suppose to keep the public interest. What loss of the talent of F. Murray Abraham. You're better served with bloody movies, like Zorro, Scaramouche, all that has Vasilie Rathbone as a bastard. As a diver, I almost recognize the impossibility of capturing fences as a sport on the film, but if ever, we have to have fresher, better-styled characters and a deeper plot.
