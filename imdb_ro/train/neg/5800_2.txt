As a horror film fan, I try to follow all the significant novelties of this genre, especially those that are the products of my native cinema. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as a Russian title of it) is one of the poorest films among them. First of all, she can not even fear a child, she moves so slowly and predictably that there is no room for true horror. Frankly speaking, he is bad at all points: from the rumored story (I do not know why the Russian producers / director have decided to turn the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into a bitter and absurd thriller in today's America, the previous reviewer is not at all enthusiastic) and to the terrible and brutal work of the actors. All the actors, including the leaders Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are fairly famous in Russia, looked like wooden dolls or something like this and it seems to me that they did not even bother playing at all, speaking only their languages English without any expression. And finally I do not understand why they shot this movie in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could have cast some American or English actors for the main parts to make them look more convincing. The same can be said about the so-called "small backgrounds of American cities" that were shot in Estonia and looked like that. The only positive moment we found in "Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not excellent, but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is all right, at least not irritating me. That's why I give it two stars. Generally, if you want to see a good horror movie? do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you look for something that pretends to be a Russian horror, I advise you to find a copy of Viy or the Spirit of Evil. It's really the extraordinary movie based on the same novel as The Power of Fear, but much, much better.
