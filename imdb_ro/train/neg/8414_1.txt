Yes. Sure enough I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Superiors. Another recycled story has shone in Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from better movies by making it into the music industry. br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, glammer suits and choreography = more money for Beyonce's "talented" draw. as the relegation style, you should appreciate the real groups that fought (without digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocrite trash.
