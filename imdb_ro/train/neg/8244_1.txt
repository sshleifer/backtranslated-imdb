I think the movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it was ... and it's just. It's an hour and a half of torment. Even more for the spectator than for the characters in the movie (the five faces). Of course the main characters take their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically good, movie. And I (usually) like horror films. I have no problem with violence in these types of movies per se. Still, all the violence in this movie has no purpose. There is no other show except that it is simply grotesque. It's the worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they tried to copy Blair Whitch Project, filming with cheap hand-held cameras. But (again, and this) has no purpose. In "Blair Which", quite certainly, there is an explanation, namely they are with their room looking for the witch blair. In this film, there is no other explanation except: "Hey ya'll we wanted this to LIKE like Blair Whitch!" The sound of the film is also something to be depressed. The girls scream so hysterically that often you can not find out what they say. Also, no effort has been made to do anything better, sound or wise. Finally, there is a soundtrack that is as bad as the rest and ranges from euro-house to the worst hard-hard rock ... <br /> <br /> I advise: Do not watch this in any situation.
