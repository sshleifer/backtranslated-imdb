I liked the Batman TV series and I was really looking forward to it. But they tried to do too much. Why had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batman was beyond me. I do not want to beat Burt or Adam as he now looks ... 35 years have passed since they appeared at Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in clothing and fighting badguys it was a little sad. I'd rather see the old stars comment. Batmobile's side story was bad. As far as the flashback movie is concerned, I think it was too short and it was too long. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed Penguin and Joker for about a minute, each to say the same things we already knew. The joker had a mustache under the makeup, and the penguin had to smoke, even if he hated it and he was a smoker. That was the 2nd. <br /> <br /> I would love to read the book. I'm sure he has more in this. What would be why there were 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Phrases. Where was Commissioner Gordon, Chef Ophara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. The list goes on. As I said, even those who were in it were barely in it. Very disappointing. And indeed horns.
