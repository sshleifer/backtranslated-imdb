I agree with what Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it is time for girls to move to better roles. I would like to see that they have done a great deal because they brought up a pair of inspiration and I would love to see them grow up as people, actresses in their career as well as their personal life. So the producers, please give girls the chance to develop something that goes tangent little, move them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This movie that is commented is not too bad, but as we have seen in their films, their films remain the same of typical plotting and typography. When in Rome it is good for younger generation audiences, but adults who were children when twins were children want to follow twins in their successes and therefore I think we adults would like to see them making films of different kinds, as the sixth sense, the watch, the chocolate, the type of film - I do not say they have only serious movies for them but also humor, but rather we see them in different roles than what they have played in their more recent films minute in New York.
