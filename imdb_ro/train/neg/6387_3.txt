When I chose the first film, I was intrigued by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I am a fan of animation and I love it when it is successfully combined with the live action movie. However, the animation in this movie was about everything I liked. Although it has to be said that the performances of the actors were excellent. The visual view - including the animation - gave an unpleasant smell to the air of the piece. However, this quality of anxiety has been lost among the exaggerated images, both visual and scenario, that you have practiced with your hand. The most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance for the plot. It seemed that the plot was stuck at irregular intervals, giving a stammering effect, which fell massively from the flow of the piece. The speeds at Felisberto - especially the one at the end - felt very much like a desperate attempt to fill the bent holes in the plot that had been ignored for secondary issues such as the whole ant (and that was not exactly what it was addressed). I'm afraid the whole piece appeared to be the best "first reasonable attempt" by a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. Not what you expect from experienced filmmakers.
