First, I have to admit it's not a good movie. And I would never look at this movie if Pacino was not in it. The movie is about 24 hours of strange publicity. And he is overwhelmed, dizzy, ill, and sometimes regrettable. as well as the character. It's very boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I do not understand why Pacino wanted to be part of this horrible movie. Just because of money or what? > Since I am a passionate fan of Pacino, I bought this 2002 film I know. If you have not bought it yet, you never think, it's just a waste of time.
