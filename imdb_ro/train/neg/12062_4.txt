When talking about large combinations of director / actor about J. Lee Thompson's team and Charles Bronson is usually not mentioned. Probably because the production of nine mixed societies between the two leads range from very good entertainment to mediocre. Unfortunately, Kinjite: the forbidden topics fall into the latter. <br /> <br /> That's sad because Kinjite could have been a lot better. But for my life I do not understand why it was necessary to make the missing Japanese father's father, a guy used to make some cheap jollies because romanticism in his marriage came out. That would have been good for another movie, but it did not serve any purpose here. A simple crime drama with Charles Bronson as a policeman who has seen too much in his work and has strong prejudices against the Orientals. That party could also have used a little and explained. But he will have to overcome it if he and his partner partner Perry Lopez locate a captured Japanese school girl. Bronson's time in the depression squad told him exactly where to find the kidnapper. A stupid, mortal played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and the Bronson have a history. In fact, in the best scene of the movie, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and put his car on fire. At one point, Fernandez happens to show Bronson and Lopez in a delicacy of the night, his rolex snack, he sprinkles his place with a murderous killing all but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than two LAPD police after Fernandez. But that's another great pit in the fence. There is still a very raw justice for Fernandez. I want the movie to be better. This was Bronson-Thompson's latest film and the last director of J. Lee Thompson. He should have done something better.
