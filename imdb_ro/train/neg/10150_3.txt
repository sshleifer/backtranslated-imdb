Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie and be forced to play a Mexican role or be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Probably, after the success of "Dodge City," Warners attempted a follow-up with Errol Flynn and the usual list of friends such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and John Litel. they made the huge mistake of trying to portray Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott and as a singer to do bad things because it turned out to be a thing and can not sing. The story was not too bad, but with mischief clearly mischief also turned out to be a poor West, which was too long and at a low budget, but in fairness, the color would not have helped.
