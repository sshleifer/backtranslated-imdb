This movie can not even say it's bad because it's unfortunately only painfully mediocre. Lacking any real intelligence or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit, and "jokes" (which are predictable and dirty) are stretched to such an attractive length that boredom and cheerleaders quickly overlook the spectator. Another note to mark John Waters' sad decline and reminded that what "shocked" or amused us 30 years ago does not work exactly the same way now. I have seen it all before and do not break the taboos any more, because they have evaporated for a long time. A major desire.
