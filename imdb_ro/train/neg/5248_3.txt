Die Sieger was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies in Germany. I saw her last night and I must admit I'm deeply disappointed. If this should be the "last best hope" for the fun and challenge of German cinema, then it is not too much. Die Sieger tries to be sexy, daring and angry, but there is nothing like that. Characters are wood and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much) the act against their nature. This makes it difficult - almost impossible for me - to follow or even identify with them. I think the film is very badly expressed. There is no character to believe in. Maybe the SWAT top officer - but that's it. Those people who try to look or behave like special units, such as elite cops - do not believe them. Not for a second. The story is not so bad after all. But I think it's wrong. You do not know the bad guy - for example. And when after a "very dark" show, Karl Simon asks his already dead opponent: "Why? ... for what?" I wondered exactly the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. I sincerely hope - no - I think Germany can do better, even with action movies.
