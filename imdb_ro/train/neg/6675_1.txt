This weekend just went to "28 weeks later", which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I said it was one of the most boring so-called horror you could ever track. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no scenario and no plot. The alien creature was unreal. Battle scenes are light compared to a battle in the school yard. And to make the worse guy named Cody had an uncontrollable loose language that distracts attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later. Cheers, Mesake C.
