When I first saw this movie in cinemas 11 years ago, I liked it. I still think that direction and cinema are excellent, just like music. But, indeed, the script has begun to bother me more and more. I find that Emma Thompson writes self-absorbed and unbelievers to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side character, another life for her, Elinor, far too old, too severe - the film is given many "focus moments" and often seems to be there just for Thompson looks herself. I understand he cut a few characters from the book but left the scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who has red and cherished the book long before the film, these are always hard to digest. As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best script in the world to work, but she draws it gracefully, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a little old, but he plays the beautiful role. And Elizabeth Spriggs, it's absolutely fantastic as always.
