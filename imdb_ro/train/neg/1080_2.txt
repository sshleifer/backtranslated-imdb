As a director of Altman's experience one might expect us to want to spend time or think about what happens to a main character that is neurotic, a whiner, a tyrant with no redeeming qualities - this is a puzzle central to this profoundly confusing work. A piece of monstrous trash. In addition to this crippling defect, the plot line requires a serious focus to follow. The arrangement of the Branagh character is so obvious as a configuration from the beginning that we are inclined to ask whether the writer and the director have completely lost their respect for the audience. This last issue is at the heart of the film: it is self-indulgence, with deep contempt for the taster, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. Patrick Watson
