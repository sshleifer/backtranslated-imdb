It was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "Baby Buggy Bunny," which was exactly this plot. Finster face-to-face stole a bench, and the money in the car rolled and fell into Bug's rabbit hole. He dressed like a kid to get into Bugg's hole to recover the money. The Little Man scene, where she looks in the bathroom mirror with a cigar in her mouth, is directly from the cartoon. This was a hilarious drawing of 5 minutes; not so much a whole movie. If you are interested in this, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original for the first time (1954). Plus you get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoon boot!
