I am a youth pastor and I took some young people to see this movie. Then we spent an hour trying to explain them. They did not get it and I did not like it. It is based on a concept that has gone through all three of the world's great religions (the Bible Code, the Torah Code and the Qur'an Code) and is so controversial that it is ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who think we are checking our brains at the door.
