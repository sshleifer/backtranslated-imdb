Dr Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend any adult or child to see if they are not already criminals. There is so much dirt in this movie that it hurts me. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky on a star background. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a bad thing. I rented every copy I could from the local video stores and crushed them with a 5-pound crucifix. The film should remain stuck in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest if you want scandalous entertainment, go and rent All dogs go to heaven or angels in the field of departure. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, you have to see Dr. Mordrid.
