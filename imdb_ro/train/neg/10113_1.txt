I discovered that this film is being rented on the packaging. zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and frightening. then you get to the film and there are women with raccoon masks. zero special effects ... and even battle scenes you can see them miss the two-legged punches. the funny thing is that Lommel acts briefly in the film himself and is worse than the rest of the fools in the film. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people make it a "classic cult" ... however, I can not imagine anyone believing that this is anything but one of the worst movies made. the real horror of this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed, I rented it and vowed never to see another Lommel movie!
