I have nothing against a quick blow, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too freshly washed, too bright and modern. The plan, about a young adolescent boy in a small town that is a "Sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, demands more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. This thriller has an inappropriate coloring, with almost any atmosphere. The kids are certainly nice and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, in "Ghost Story," never broke out of the filler mold, and it's a huge loss that it was not used anymore. Her performance is frightening and intense and shows that Sleepwalkers could have been a much better movie with a different focus and a closer look. It's too much above and driven commercially, with a non-uniform tone that binds wildly to thriller, comedy and drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, as well as real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
