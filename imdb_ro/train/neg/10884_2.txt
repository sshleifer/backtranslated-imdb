In fact, these youngsters were so uncomfortable that I could not wait for everyone to be sacrificed, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), since I considered her most annoying. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess of opening time when a teenager Christine opened the priest and nuns with Leslie Gore's music playing in the background. He had no place to go but down. Even the prostheses looked fake and the "blood" looked suspicious that the Hawaiian Punch, though later took on the red to fit with the silly Halloween makeup wore it all. I'm sure all the GOTH monsters out there will appreciate this stuttering, because they'll appeal to that bunch. She did not appeal to me. Blah ... And not even my favorite horror lover, Adrienne Barbeau, can save this terrible horror movement of horror. Still, it still seems hot. I'm glad she's taking care of herself, since we can not see it too much nowadays. However, it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli's HORDER (2002), in which a rather coherent plot, so I will give it so much. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer brings her. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in a silly movie. Perhaps Lion's Gate Films must have been desperate when they chose that. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
