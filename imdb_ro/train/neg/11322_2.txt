There is a word for this type of movie, and that word is "lost." It was a mistake when it was a VHS rental, and now it's a satellite return. <br /> <br /> It could fool you, because it has 2 moderately well known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, and the beautiful Landscape Monument Valley. She also has a curly-haired woman who struggles a lot. If that's all you want from a movie, maybe that will keep you happy. Still, however, it's harder.
