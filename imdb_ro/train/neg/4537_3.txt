Actually, I did not enjoy this movie. I saw her in a camp, and we did not kidnap, we laughed at her. Sure, some parts are exciting, but the act is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole movie idea is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I did not read but I hope the book was better than that's because, frankly, I thought this movie was really bad and boring). As I said, I went to her with a bunch of people in a camp and we were excited to be there, plus a drink with caffeine, but still I tried to stay awake. The only thing that kept me (other than my fear of being embarrassed when I woke up) were the gunfire, which was quite useless. I really did not like it.
