Scary film for "Scary Movie 2" was not ready to go. This is a film problem that is obviously obvious to both actors and the public. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many of the actors are fun; and so the film is not completely humorous. To give credit, the movie has some funny moments. But overall, the movie "Scary Movie 2" is not even close to being as intelligent and fun as the original. The first "Scary Movie" was a one minute laugh. He turned the smallest subtleties of the movie genre into comedy gold. The humor of "Scary Movie 2" is as hard as the original. They really miss the obvious occasions of parody. Two of the stars of the movie are former members of "Beverly Hills 90210" and this was a show that asked to be parodied! Finally, the movie "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened too soon. The script would take much longer to get older. 2 stars out of 5.
