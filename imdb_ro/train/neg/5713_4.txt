There's nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting a cinematic American experience instead. It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on setting up intelligent characters. As for love, the protagonists in Say Yes are a married couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are bad beyond belief. Count the ways in which they do not act terrorized by a stalker. Once a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you are staying when you leave him. <br /> <br /> 2. Fuck the hell out of the stalker in daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing them to press aggression. Do not bother telling the policemen about the stalker and just suppose (for no apparent good reason) that the cops were bribed by him. <br /> <br /> 4. As you try to escape, leave your lady in sight as much as possible to make sure the stalker abducts her. <br /> <br /> 5. After receiving someone's help to find the stalker after your wife's kidnap, be sure to send them as soon as possible so you can deal with one -one. There is no point in being unfair, is it? <br /> <br /> I would never expect anyone to be immune to make a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in 'Say Yes' are so dense and make so many mistakes that it's way effectively impossible for the spectator to take care of their safety because they are victims of their own actions. This destroys the joy of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've been wondering, the scriptwriters did not stop in weak characters. Because they themselves are certainly impressed to have written this, they have decided to make so absurdly unrealistic situations that all the senses of reality come out of the window. Stalker kills a policeman inside a police station? while the protagonist does not sleep more than 10 meters. <br /> <br /> 2. The Stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in the daylight and around many people, but no one other than the married seems to notice his strange behavior. The Stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. The "suspense" scene had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American films. The only positive thing is decapitation from the end, which was a pretty brutal scene because it was caused to the wife. It is too bad for manufacturers to follow it with a very stupid end that comes out of the left field. Indeed, the Koreans behind Say Da's production should be ashamed of themselves. Better, they should move to California and engage with people who make movies with an injustice similar to quality and intelligence.
