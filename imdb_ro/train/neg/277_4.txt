Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with Hellman's help, becomes a curious project to get out of Warner Bros. stones. Paul Lukas, resuming Broadway's role and winning the Best Actor Oscar, plays a German anti-Nazi leader, fighting against fascists, pulling his American wife and three children from across Europe before fleeing to the States (across the border with Mexico) . They settle in Washington with their wife's rich mother and brother, although a border that lives in the mansion is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends a lot of time in the German embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever this drama to find its attention and when we realize the heart of the material (the wise, honest and direct refugees, who teach the Americans without blemish, their heads in the sand, how the world has changed suddenly) seems a little patronized - the viewer is literally put in place of relatives, being taught. Lukas has some speeches in the third act that undoubtedly won Oscar, but for most of the image he seems to do little, but to get in and out, get in and out. As her husband, Bette Davis envisions no one else, and works his broad eyes to the advantage, but the role does not allow her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are usually humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald does not have the role of a wife (and the dissatisfied texture it brings to the part seems totally wrong). The intention here was to show us with taste, to show us only because a man (since the Second World War) could be German, which does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We get this in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasty and tactical film is made up of exposure, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a strange combination, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from ****
