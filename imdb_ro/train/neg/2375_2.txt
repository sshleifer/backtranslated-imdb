Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare series on the Elm Street series and once again a bad sequel. I think this is related to the last follow-up of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to make her the Nightmare set on Elm Street for my birthday, so I came to see all the sequels. I can say that I'm getting more and more disappointed with these sequels, at least the last two, it seems that Freddy has lost its edge. It's almost like the writers are trying to give Freddy a soul and destroy it only instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not necessary, I'm sorry for Robert Englund, but he was far below what Freddy Krueger is. Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know about, a daughter. Maggie, she does not know she's her father, but she soon finds out what his secrets are dark and wants her help. He has to do his best to resist his powers, but he is tough with all the good memories he has about her loving father. It's ironic, is not it? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating it in his ways. Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare is also featured in 3-D, radical, huh? Notice sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, linked to the fifth sequel of the Nightmare Series on the Elm Street series, I would prefer to look at the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. That's just a bad attitude, stupid editing and, above all, a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept and ruined the very idea that Freddy Krueger is really the master of the nightmare, not the Parents know better.
