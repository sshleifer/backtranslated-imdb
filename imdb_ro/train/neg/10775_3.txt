This movie is horrible! She rivals "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassing moments. I would have rated it less than 3, except for two funny lines; but on the whole, this movie was a carp! They seem to have done it over a weekend at a bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the direction of direction forever!
