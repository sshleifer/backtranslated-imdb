Richard Dix is ​​a great, not too handsome industrialist who almost committed suicide to death. If he takes the holiday that doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he will probably be better if he does not consider VOICE OF THE WHISTLER. This entry to William Castle has some wonderful moments (introduction and description of Richard Dix's life through Citizen Kane's newsreel), and some interesting plot rolls. Dix's performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the right one does not work because buying is not enough for the characters to behave as they do. The film also comes from a dark (and fascinating) film to a nearly merry film of the 1930s, such as the midsection (full of beautiful urban ethnicities that do not think they are rich) and again in - a noir complex plot for the last 15 minutes or so. This is a decent movie - it's worth seeing - but it takes a little more time to set some characters and a female leader able to fulfill her role requirements.
