This is at least the third remake of this movie, so if you follow it, there is a feeling of already vu, do not surprise yourself. All they did was change the story setting and say it differently, but the differences are not significant. And it does not get better because the plot is wrong to get started. It never works. And as its predecessors, the act is mediocre. The land has a unique end that will surprise anyone who has not seen the movie before, but the end does not match the story. If the movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and it would have been very satisfying and I thought it was worth more. But here is the spoiler and that ultimately crime does not pay because the killer is not caught. I never like this message that results from a movie.
