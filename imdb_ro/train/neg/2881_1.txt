This movie was so ridiculous that I never finished watching, actually I thought someone made their own version and put it on DVD in the movie store. This movie made me sick not because it was upsetting, but because I lost 2 50 on it !!!! Looks like my brother and I went into a house and I made the film on my own and I wrote the slaughter material in it! I'm so beaten, even The Killer BTK deserves more credit than it was not even right I mean to come on the head of the cow was obviously made of dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG I can not even sing all the words to explain it DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
