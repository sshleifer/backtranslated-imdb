A teenager who seems to have everything suicides. He lets his family and best friend (Keanu Reeves) ask a lot of questions ... and blame themselves. Good idea, badly treated. For starters, this was done before 1988 - especially in TV and Specialty after school. In addition to some swearing and dialogue (hence the PG-13 rating), this has brought nothing new. The result is predictable, and Reeve's attempts to act were really painful to follow. It's good now, but not in 1988. Besides, his character was dressed like a slob and always seemed so dirty it was hard to create sympathy. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. In principle, I could not wait for this to happen. I have a vague memory to see the movie in a theater in 1988 and to hate it (BADLY bombarded). It still seems to be bad about 20 years later. The subject deserves to be manipulated, but it has been made better (with better action) in countless other films. "The ordinary people" come to mind. You can skip this.
