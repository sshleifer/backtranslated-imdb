Despite the fact that, unfortunately, he thinks he is (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately, this film is taking place with pity. The script does not make sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is odd, and John Lydon shows us all in the space of a movie why he should never give up on music. His performances are noteworthy and irritating. The only positive thing to say is that Harvey Keitel manages to give a good round. Later, Lie Lieutenant Bad would show how strong the actors can play, but with goodness his performance here is restricted.
