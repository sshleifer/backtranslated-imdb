Colleges of students who remove a condemned bedroom are being followed by an elusive killer. Sleep that escaped blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of mixing bag for slasher fans. Film production values ​​are fairly low, and the story is largely routine, there is even a scary scare for a red herring. In fact, much of the storyline is quite forgetful, except in the case of brutal crime. But the film is really improved by the surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and by a rather bold, unconventional conclusion. For the most part, distribution is unclear. Stephen Sachs is the best of the batches as he makes a pretty tower in character. Also, look for a young Daphne Zuniga as a sick student. <br /> <br /> Over all this is a fairly standard B slasher effort, but the end is well worth it and for this viewer saved the movie to be a complete ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
