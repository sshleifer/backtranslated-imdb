He caught this film on the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked at IMDb to see what others were thinking. I was not surprised at the number of stupid people who enjoyed this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked into the comments to read the Hated It categories just to find out they were not. I was shocked by this; I always look at hate, as they are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is. In a way this movie made it through untouchable haters I say to that and proudly proclaim that I hated this movie! I know I should go into detail about why I hate this movie, but that would give this film more respect than it deserves.
