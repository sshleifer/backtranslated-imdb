I went to see him with a long wait. Unfortunately, the dialogue is absolutely stupid and, in general, the film is far from inspiring amazement or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic of character behaviors. Children today need creative stories that inspire them, which would make them "blizzard" about events. That's exactly what happened to films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children have imagined you become Jedi Knights and lighting their own lights?) Seriously, do not waste your time and money on this.
