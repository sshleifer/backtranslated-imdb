As a fan of the Star Trek series, I discovered this disappointing episode and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" with Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain and death a crewmate) was a money-saving device, as were many of their "glass shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than her for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. People with loyalty (in the Star Trek world, is there any other type?) They were also short exchanged. This was the last episode of the second season; so the season ended "not with a bang", but with "a whimper".
