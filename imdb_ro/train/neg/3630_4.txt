We have to suppose those who appreciated this movie ("the greatest work ever shot", did not read somewhere?) Either he does not care about the opera, does not care about Wagner, or I do not care about anything theirs to appear in the culture. Whether it's a representation of Wagner's swan song or a film, this seems to me to be an endless disaster with a full reading of the score, suited to a strange and ludicrous achievement of the text. Doubtful that people who have ideas about what a work (or, for example, a piece, especially a Shakespearean one) is "about" should be allowed anywhere near a theater or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification in Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration so that the title character in the last stages turns into a kind of babe beatnik, although one continues to sing tenor - few, if any of the actors in the film are singers, and we have a double dose of conductor, Armin Jordan, which is seen as the face (but not heard as voice) by Amfortas and also seems monstrous in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Ate Monsalvat during the Good Friday game - where, by the way, the transcendent beauty of nature is represented by a scattering of crocodile crooks and flickers left in the turf, an advantage that defames me. In theater, sometimes we have to destroy such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can not think why Syberberg could not join Parsifal and Gurnemanz as a mountain pasture as rich as Julie Andrews in Sound of Music. . Sound is hard to endure, especially voices and trumpets that possess a phonetic glow, which adds another kind of fatigue to our impatience through the unfolded deployment and paralyzing unfolding of the ritual. Someone from another magazine mentioned the record at Bayreuth in 1951, and Knappertsbusch, although its rhythm is often very slow, had what the Jordan does not have altogether, a sense of pulse, a sense of ebb and the flow of music - and , after half a century, the orchestral sound of this set in modern presses is still superior to this film.
