Marilyn Miller made only three films before his premature death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this miracle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early projection and as a musical experience - although it has four dance numbers, she plays only two songs (WHO and ONE MAN). The rest of the score including the sprinted title tone is jettisoned, although we can hear the latter score in the background score. Miller looks overweight and amateur here - no star quality. Even her dance is impatient. The film is very badly written, stock full of joyful and unhappy jokes and silly situations. If you are interested in Miller as an interpreter, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
