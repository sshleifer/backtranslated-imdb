I do not even want to call this movie a movie - it's a movie that should not have won any prize. The act was horrible, like silly scenarios. This is precisely the kind of film that so many people think he is dealing with an NRI audience, but he is in fact despised abroad for the overwhelming dominion and sense of "trial" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to me that so many actors familiar with English have so hard to do this convincingly in front of the room. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those English-language phrases shot in a movie, in Hindi, and in the cool-out regional cinema. There are few Indian movies in which English seems completely authentic - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although it was not a great movie, it was a good movie and the language did not seem "put". <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only half-pleasant parts of this trash were Konkana and a somewhat appealing background score. Besides, do not waste your time with this movie.
