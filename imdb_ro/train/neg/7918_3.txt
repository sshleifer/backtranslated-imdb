I found writing in this absolutely terrible movie. The only thing that saved this movie from me was rated as one of ten was Lacy Chabert's performance, which I thought he played very well with multiple personalities. For me it was definitely the climax of this film. Dina Meyer was pretty much like usual, but I found my role pretty gentle, so I do not think it can be said that her acting was great. > <br /> <br /> As far as male leadership is concerned, Armand Assante, his role-playing role was especially remembered by doctors in the 1980s hospital series. All I could have lived in. However, the terrible, the terrible, the terrible end / solution, the role of the psyche, and even the role of the psyche were just some of the most serious writings we have seen for a long time.
