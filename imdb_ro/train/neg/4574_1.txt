I entered this movie waiting to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Well, I was wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written plot with bad behavior in the film (with animated CG cells and boot peptides). However, the real focus of the film is the "experts" who spoke heads that brought new ages of good age between parcel segments. Sure, she's getting pretty innocent. There is a bit of real quantum physics at first. It states, for example, that electrons exist as both particles and waves, and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the film makes a huge (and non-scientific) leap, saying sub-atomic quantum effects also happen on large scales. The head of speech takes it even more. According to them, the following are true: When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see their ships, because their minds were unable to perceive something so different. - Mediation can reduce the crime rate. - With positive thinking, you can go on the water. - Your thoughts can change the ice crystal formations into water bottles. And hey, that's just in the first 40 minutes! Watching the movie was torture. This movie was like a movie that would show you to bring you to a cult. After I did my homework, I realized that basically it was just that. On the other hand, it could be seen as a playlist comedy (though one is not funny). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: you do not see this movie.
