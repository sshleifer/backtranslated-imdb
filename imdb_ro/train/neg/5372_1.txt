Someone wonders why the picture was not at all: the plot as such is absolutely incredible, if not ridiculous, the characters (with the experience of lonely children towards the youngest, quite fascinated) are quite predictable, ending completely unclear and impossible to understand but you should have a masochistic trend for it, the idea being that you have to read the book to fully understand what it is) and the act is bad. Was it the basic idea to show that the French film producers are capable of doing, as well as Americans of the "Seven" and "Silence of the Mie" genres? If so, it is a total failure. It was a pretty big success (and has a kind of cult-status as the first serial killer in France) and it seems to be considered a good product to export. Strange.
