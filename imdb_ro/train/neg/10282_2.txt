I did not expect this to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so terrible. I hated the mother's character so much that I had to turn the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was only part of the movie, but not. And why should the daughter stay there be ashamed or almost finished out of a job or driven to madness in her own house? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even worry) my mother, but I would have taken her to the nearest hotel if she was annoying in my house. I was expecting to follow a set of rules in my mom's house, after all. I did not buy a thing. I tried to give him more chances, indeed. Sorry.
