Wanda Nevada is a pubic fantasy film that uses about 1979 ideas about what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. Writing, rhythm and direction are terrible uniforms. The sequences of action defy the faith. Characters speak with the simplified dictionary he usually finds in movies targeting the set of less than 10 years, but also includes more sexual references involving Shield's character as well as graphic death. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy at a certain level, but it's never fun, an adventure picture, but plot and action are insipid, and a movie for children but introduces pedophilia and child rape as possibilities real. It also wants to be a friendly picture, an age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travel route and a Western one. The overall impact is massive silly, with an ugly twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete loss of time if you do not want to see many great pictures of Grand Canyon. That manages to do well.
