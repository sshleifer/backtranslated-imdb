I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get blues if this movie is something to go by. I was expecting something better from Uma Thurman, which is why I went through this experience first of all. A terrible movie, with music just as a quality of redemption. It's just a shame that we are unable to score 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This film deserves.
