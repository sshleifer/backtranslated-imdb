Dude, what the hell were they doing this movie? More importantly, where can I get something? The opening scene sets the tone of the film: a woman flying in a circle of fire, turning into a werewolf. And that's not a transformation of Rick Baker's American werewolf, folks. We talk about some of the worst makeup ever filmed here. I can imagine an Italian glue scattered on Annik Borel (who interprets Daniela, the protagonist of the film (is a word?)), And asks her to rotate in fur. It's so bad. Hence there is not much better. Minutes are squandered as the male cheering landscape will be on Daniela and her condition or something (I do not remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you do not laugh at it, you will cry). <br /> <Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a psychopath who walks mentally whenever there is a man around him (understandable how he was raped as a child) so she thinks she gets a a werewolf as her opening ancestor). He can only help pull the neck of every man he meets and just wants to be loved! Things start looking for Daniela when she meets and falls in love with a stunt that does not trigger her "episodes". Check out the fittings here, one of the most beautiful ones you'll ever see (laughing and hugging after a direct dive through a window). Daniela's luck does not stop as the movie turns into it is suddenly beaten and raped with the vice by a group of thieves who kill her on the stunt. The memory of "Spit on the tomb", Daniela takes bloody revenge on her rapists. This is 100 minutes of my life I will not come back. But hey, that's the game you play when you're a film geek.
