Frank Sinatra was far from being the ideal actor for Westerners. He was a great actor, From here to Eternity and Man with the Golden Arm is proof of this, but he did not have the character of a Western hero, you identified him as an urban type. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a box office failure was not his fault. I blamed two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero in the whole movie. In a genre where people were expecting a certain pattern, the film must be very good to get out of it. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole city will allow Sinatra to do all he wants only because he is afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special heel that will open sideways, so he does not have to fire the gun, you wonder if this will make him invincible, why did not all the warlords adopt? I think this film should not have been retired because any Sinatra film is worth seeing and, despite its shortcomings, it is still enjoyable
