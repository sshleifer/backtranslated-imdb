Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerous, is a parody of gangster films from the 1930s, made in the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays the role of a middle-aged gangster who looks back at his life of heavy blows when he catches a child trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has health problems continue, young age through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri plays the role of a killer against Boyle and Keaton, who eventually rises. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn like Danny Vermin, yes, so, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother, becoming prosecutor, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton. The film is notoriously inexpensive, which makes it look like a television show instead of a theater movie. The film starts excellent and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogue and gags, the film keeps its own for the first half of the year, but then quickly loses its steam and falls into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chewed the landscape with the best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just inappropriate, not funny. Piscopo once "once" a little too much. A few supporting actors are trying to keep the force like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as Sergeant Bond and Suddi Bond as an unscrupulous lady. The second half evolves into a hit-show sound or misses television and never recovers. The closing scene that uses Twenties Roaring is an anachronism, like the movie The Call of the Wild Clark Gable, seen on a marquee earlier in the movie. I think Heckerling should have known better because the target audience would certainly be aware of the current launch date of The Roaring Twenties of 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
