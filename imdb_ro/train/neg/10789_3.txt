If you expect to see a crowd in the Altıoklar bath, as promised by the line of labels, you will be very disappointed that the film consists of anything other than the populist style of Altıoklar in terms of the most famous issues, such as sex, marriage, and deception. For a lot of nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or connection with the plot, it proves that Altıoklar tried unsuccessfully to "try something new" as he quoted. For sex-centered jokes seems to show that Altıoklar has fallen for the famous story of "sex is selling." I was hoping to see a very good story with a very good narrative technique. But I eventually woke up standing for 90 minutes and looked at the work of Altıoklar, experimental, but still much focused on popularity.
