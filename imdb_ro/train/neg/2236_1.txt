I do not know where to begin. Working in this movie was really terrible, I do not remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie that was not able to act. Not only was the actor bad, but the characters were incredibly stupid. I think even kids know that when someone is shot, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I think it's just me. To make a short short story (because you believe me, I can give myself a few hours about this movie), this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie should be number 1 at the bottom 100 no doubt.
