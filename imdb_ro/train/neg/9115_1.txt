If you ask me, the first one was a better one. Look at Sarah M.G., she's a real, bad woman, look at Amy Adams she's just stupidly hanging around. It is nothing! People do not love it! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first film, now he is the "baby girl". The story is not so good and I do not understand. Why they did not do this first is the beginning. Loose actors, nothing with the story. This is not cruel, this is happening. The first one has better actors, a better story and an average. I think music is better in cruel intentions 1 and music is better in cruel intentions 3. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but in compaer with the first one big, big, nothing big.
