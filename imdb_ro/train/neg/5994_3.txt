Ok .. this movie could have been great! All generations were exposed to Thunderbirds and came to love him and this movie had some of the features that they would look for in a thunderbirds good movie. The Craft itself and Tracey Island have been realistically transferred to the big screen while keeping the drawings we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, while I did not intend to be Jeff Tracey, were pretty solid ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation were asked to believe that they are 8 years old could fly 200 tons of cars. It's not so much that the movie was centered around the kids that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was fooling me with wet fish and laughing at my hard-earned money on the film, was that Alan Tracey was so inconvenient in film and that it seemed to be as capable of flying as cars and his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are pretty damn machines to use, if any. The film did not seem to know if it wanted to be serious or phony. He tried to pay homage while he was satirious and generally fell on flat. 3/10 (2 for cars, 1 for Lady P)
