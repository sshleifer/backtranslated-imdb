This so-called prequel is just a remake done bad for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. Plots are the same as most of the scenario. I liked the book that relied on her and I loved the first film, but I do not even bother with the third film. The useless sign of the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and non-original and ... I can not emphasize how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word, just watch out and see what I mean. If you read a review that says "If you like the first, you'll love the second," the only reason it is is that it's exactly the same movie! Although the plot is not as good. They've taken so many lines from the first movie, It's hard to say what movie you're watching.
