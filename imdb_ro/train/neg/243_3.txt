William Russ is the main character alongside this television movie. He left his family behind to reappear and pay his debts. But he's trying to avoid his family. This is where Peter Falk (Colombo) enters, playing several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average and they managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it at a fairly nice level. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems that his action is still fine. I found the delivery and the very cheesy story in the way everything was predictable. Actually, in the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate the word before it happened. A good movie should never be that way. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a sub-par. In a letter classification system, it would get a "D".
