I would have liked to return my money for renting this piece of garbage, so I could give it to the House of Elderly Actors. Total rubbish! Five people watched this movie at the same time, and there was no laughter to be heard but yawning many times. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie.
