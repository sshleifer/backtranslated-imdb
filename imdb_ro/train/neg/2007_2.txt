The distribution is fine. The script is sometimes weird and it takes a while to find out what the point of the movie is. I was looking forward to making dishes. The Shehan Bit is a gross declaration of war. I think we should not have noticed ... I did. His house, you only killed forty-five minutes. The shower ... no? What was that about? I literally have a customer, "Ok, you can use our shower." Yawning. The angles are trying hard. There was a set of forests that suddenly disappeared because you see it right, then it is deep and the animals die. Finally, this is a terrible movie of dull proportions.
