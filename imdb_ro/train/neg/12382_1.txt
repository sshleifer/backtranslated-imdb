Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would be overthrown in their graves if they knew that. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Rip Off was actually in the theater. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Stanley Kramer's masterpiece in 1967. Nowadays it's a joke. So a white guy from an extremely stereotypical Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend home (enter GASP here) at his father's funeral. The reactions of his family members were, of course, predictable. This movie was so painful to telegraph from the beginning to the end, my girlfriend actually started the fake to signal that she wanted to leave. Do a favor and rent the original. Make a pass to Wake.
