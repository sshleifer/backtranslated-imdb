Spoilers ahead - do your own precautions. My main problem with this movie is that once Harry finds the identity of the three blackmailers - easily relatively easy - he continues to overwhelm their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to support his classic car to explode (with the money in it), which makes us make a fairly high jump in logic. Okay, so he wanted to keep his Cini business out of the public eye because of his wife's involvement in DA campaign. This is what I see, but why not hire someone to squeeze these buds around a bit, or even kill them once they have established that there is no evidence of blackmail (for example, Cini's body?). it was a pretty interesting film for the first two thirds of it. After that, it collapses.
