She's a girl, and she's running into the woods, but she ends up in this woman's clinic and wants an abortion. Her father is out in a truck and he's upset. The entire episode takes place in and out of this abortion clinic. I'm not really pro-choice, but I wanted the choice to kill this episode. I laugh when I saw the baby coming out and got into the corner. The side where they made the ultra sound was pretty funny. I'm sorry for the poor father in this episode. She just wanted to protect her daughter and I could not blame him for what he was doing. I do not know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I was too laughing and I would suggest to look at "Pick me up" instead of this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not great.
