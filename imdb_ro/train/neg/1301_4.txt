I have recently seen this at Palm Springs International 2009. This is the directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last. I hate films that are so implacable that you virtually destroy every scene. This movie immediately let you scratch your head. While a young photographer and his girlfriend working for an international aid organization are starting to move slowly into the Taliban-controlled Afghan mountains, Afghanistan has a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a lorry in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols, and grenades running all five in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take pictures, however, when spotted by one of the insurgents who hit a hand grenade to those who kill his girlfriend. because they are at the distance of hand throw can not be more than 50 meters away, but he somehow gets away. His girlfriend is thrown into the air and takes a photo of the moment of the impact of the grenade that kills her and wins a photographer's award for photography. Every scene and situation in this movie as ridiculous as it opens. The following year, Bob is on a mission for National Geographic, on an island in the Dutch resort, where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and enters the thin world of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
