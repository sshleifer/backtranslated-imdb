Townies is the lightest movie I've ever seen and I've seen Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). He seems confused in what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not quite tragic for the drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. She has scenes of a man who makes "karate slapstick / bloody", so I think this movie will be in the blame of Avenger Toxic and Trash Street. Then she escapes without a warning in a drama about a missing girl, a retarded woman (mental handicap) and a mother who trusts. Then he gets bored in the good part of the movie, which seems to be installed as a sitcom without laughter. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TONEIE that is so lonely that she finds comfort in a rotting body. That was the only part of the movie that gave me the feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there, there is some kind of DOCUMENTATION at the end of Wayne's (director) movie, which is publicly entertained by Toby (the star). He hurt me. Even if Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (the other two Wayne movies) are not the best, at least they are thought pretty much if you can have fun until the end of the credits. I really like Killer Nerd a little, he had some wonderful lines I still use today. If you like the underground movies, if you like the overground movies and if you like to watch your feet, just resting, you are, you do not like ALL! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br />
