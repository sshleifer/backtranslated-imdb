Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world did not have pets, but Europeans did, and that explains why we were able to build steel and invent complex cars. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode he says that when the South African Europeans went too far north, they met with people from Zulu and other tribes who had fed cattle and planted crops. So, what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements, if they had the most important things that the author claims are necessary for success? The diamond also claims germ-shaped germs (brought to North America by slavish blacks) were the largest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without any accident * in both cases, then I think we have to conclude that the germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we managed to succeed. He says malaria prevented Europeans from colonizing the north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers, but he does not say.) Then, at the end, he says today that malaria kills thousands of Africans and that's why they can not get along with us. So, what is it, Jared? Malaria helped Africans stop Europeans or hurt them? And how did Europe do well despite massive epidemics throughout our history? He also seems too keen to say that the reasons that Europeans have succeeded in were lucky. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm the coveted theories, he does not want to recognize that Europeans have been successful because they have worked for him. It's a sad hour of this obvious neo-Marxist reality contorting to try to prove its point.
