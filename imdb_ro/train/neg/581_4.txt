Before proceeding, I must admit that I am a huge fan of Bon Jovi. In fact, this is primarily attracted to the DVD. Perhaps I would have bought him anyway to be such a horror fan and enjoy the title of the first Vampiri so much. But that's not half as good. Even Jon could not save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it's simply not scary. Apart from the character of Jon Derek Bliss, none of the other characters make an impression and you can not care less if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict. The female vampire is simply not scary or sexy. Rather it looks like an anorexic little girl of 14, no wonder she's so desperate for blood. Another big problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or feeling of fear. I know the first vampires who settled in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight area in terms of anger, but it still managed to be dark and pretended when it was supposed to be. This movie has no tension like this. The story is basically the same as before. The vampire wants the Berzier cross to go in the light of the day. However, the story has bits less interested this time. There is no wow factor in knowing that this is the master of all the master - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really do not care who or what that is. There is no army of masters. Instead of hiding in an old ruin that looks more like an attraction in Disneyland, then with a creepy temple. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of an interesting story. A real disappointed for me personally.
