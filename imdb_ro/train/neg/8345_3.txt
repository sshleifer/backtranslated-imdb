This movie could have been much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate, the portrait of Frankie Lymon, was not good, especially in musical performances. He does not have a lip sync and his stage manners are Larenz Tate, when Frankie Lymon should have been. The representation of women like a bunch of gold diggers has written Hollywood everywhere. The powers that obviously pushed him, but made the characters more unrealistic. The film's positions were Michel Nunez's portrait of Little Richard as well as the portrait of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It is too bad that the talent of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox was wasted. Frankie Lymon's entire sled was fascinating in real life. Too bad that this movie was a scattered opportunity.
