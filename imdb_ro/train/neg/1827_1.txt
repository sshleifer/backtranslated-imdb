Envie sees some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a distribution, one can expect the best. However, with "Envy", no one can save this disaster. Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and colleagues at a sandpaper factory. Both of them make a decent life, but because Tim has a better performance at work, she can afford more than Nick's friend. Nick is a dreamer who always comes up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray that can make the dog disappear (Yes, I'm serious). Daring the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer for Tim to invest in his idea and to divide the profits by 50/50. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. Nick's invention, "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), ends up making millions. He spends his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal coach and fancy desserts. Tim starts to feel envious of Nick. Hence the name of the movie. The concept is not bad, but it is still terrible. This film contains some of the worst dialogues and very poor performances of all distributions. Then again, as mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character called "J-man," made this movie funny. The film is bad from the start and continues to get worse. We recommend this movie if: * you like shit (it's not a word game) * you want to see Jack Black in a white brunette /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at any price, but avoid especially if: * you are offended by the humor in the bathroom * you love the animals
