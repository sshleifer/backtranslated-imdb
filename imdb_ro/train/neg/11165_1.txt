I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost my sense of humor or it's just a very bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and not funny AT ALL. Since I saw the preview, I knew it would not be a great movie, I just did not think it would be so bad. .. What happened to good times when you could find intelligent fun lines at any movie? When actors did not have to play ridiculous roles in an attempt to be funny? Now we find films like this one, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 where we could not find funny songs! Jump over this garbage <br /> <br /> PS (sorry for my English)
