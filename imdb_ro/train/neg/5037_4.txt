Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she's fifteen, and her birthday comes in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to connect with her, but the few succeed in catching her interest in mysterious death. To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is that Dana Kimmel on Friday The 13th point 3 was in him, which is not a good reason to rush and to see a movie. When I started watching her, I realized that Sweet Sixteen is not a very good slasher, it's really boring and boring and just does not go anywhere. After more than an hour, only three crimes occurred and the story did not develop in a way. The movie is well shot with a beautiful photo and a good direction, but like many other slash shots in the '80s, the movie is suffering from time to time too dark. The act is actually pretty good, though Melissa's character is easy to feel though she is a full whore. The story line is not completely rubbish, but it's just too boring to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested were Melissa she was amazing and Dana Kimmel whose very sweet and cute in this movie. All in all pretty boring slasher girl who does not go anywhere I would certainly not recommend it to the Slasher fans.
