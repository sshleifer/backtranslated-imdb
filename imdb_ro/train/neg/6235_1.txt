Well made Al Gore! You have become the first person to make 1 billion dollars of lying against global warming! Just like the other man who made fables in the world, he's there with the best lies to suck in so many people. Sure pollution is not a good thing and I would like the tree to continue to grow, but global warming is a business! It uses thousands of people who are very misleading. Google it! There are just a lot of things that do not add up, but Al has done well, you've failed as a politician, but you've continued to make enough money in the world. What's next? Is Santa real?
