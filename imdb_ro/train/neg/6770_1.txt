I went to see this movie for 17 years. daughter. We insisted on getting out of the matinee, not because I'm a stupid guy, but I feel like I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, this is the dream of a sponsor. Such blatant advertising almost qualifies as information-commercial, if not so-called acting. Taking into account the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its story lines, the car is just a "vehicle" (this is not a word game) for this horn game. Earlier estimates of Herbie (although cheeses also) have been produced in more serious periods, making them a little easier to digest. Miss Lohan, Disney's dramatic queen, has a small capacity to act. I was surprised that Mr Keaton and Mr Dillon would be involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff!
