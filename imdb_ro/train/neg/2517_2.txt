This film is the perfect illustration of how NOT a SF movie is made. The worst trend in science fiction is to turn your theme into a dreadful, sophomorphic, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / every "human future" vision. Producers of science-fiction films (and authors) as geeks are being taken very seriously, given the high ratio of shit to genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just managed to relax), such as horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a better understanding of the fact that they do not change the world with some deep "message "Science can certainly be a serious success, as many great directors have shown. But there is a huge disadvantage to the whole concept of "Robot Jox," with the construction of the "future" with a low rent (a lonely good design element: bizarre and billboard-like ads all over it I encourage women to have more children) and its "Iliad" parallels painfully (A NAMED ACHILLES FOR THE SIEG OF GOD!) Actually, I did not care until I saw the film for the tenth time, so that movie makers are not exonerated.) Of course, if you're a film madman like me, this disadvantage has a big advantage. I love movies so, because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. It's kind of a Lester Bangs approach to watching movies, I think. <br /> <br /> Note: Leading into this movie (Gary Graham ?, is his name? I refuse to go check.) It's not that bad. He does a job. He's pretty cold, especially when he's drunk / hung.
