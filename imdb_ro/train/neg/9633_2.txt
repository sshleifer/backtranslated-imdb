Does Elizabeth Taylor, rich, suffer the defeat of the angel of death on the island of the Mediterranean islands, or does it react too quickly - or, more precisely, overdo it - as usual? In fact, both are applicable to the direction of Joseph Losey, the miserable, miserable misery called "Boom", properly called because the luxuriant, luxurious luxuries are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; she puts it in a full samurai coat with the sword. Though widespread in the widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz 'n Dick-philes should avoid (star colleagues "what the hell!" Attitude to their late film career in the 1960s to an ego-mad nadir here). Unnecessary, confusing and crazy, "Boom" is a catastrophe - though writer Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play, "The Milk Train does not stop here," he was said to be quite fond of him! * from ****
