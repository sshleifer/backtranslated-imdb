I hired her, so shoot me! A decent premise raises an otherwise uncomfortable story, without any real pay, but at least it is shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a truly haunted home in danger. In most cases, this should be a dunk slam, but this little stinker derives quite quickly. Cinematography is superior to the media, and acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing are simply terrible. Shorter pictures shoot forever, and scarecrows are too few and no longer have a real climate for the movie. A scornful state is set in the beginning, but it loses its brightness before any horror occurs and I get bored of death and making another sandwich ... The cover is appealing and I suppose it deserves a hire if you look for a meticulous budget deficit, but if you enjoy a good story and an eventful event, you get to something else.
