I'll make this short and sweet .... this movie sucks !!!!!! I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the biggest movies ever, it gave her 9-star 10. So I thought that Part 2 and 3 could be good centuries, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and it was so different from the one in the first one, it had a continuous plot and that's it. It was as if I did the first part or something like that. I love Walken, but I felt bad about him here. I was so glad that Glenn Danzig was in this movie, but it does not smell you will lose them. It was a full cast of tangled actors and people I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people on Earth. This movie will make you the first one a little less, so do not watch it because you feel you owe it yourself, being a fan of part 1. I'll wait a few days before I look at the third part and I pray to be better than this stupidity. The last scene of the lightning film was one of the most beautiful things on the film. Continue forward or move to the fact that you can not stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - it was terrible!
