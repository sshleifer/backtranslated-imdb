to be honest, I did not watch all the original "yelling," but the scenes I saw made it clear that the first scream was a great movie. so great that seven horrible sequels were to be made. They started with "Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf." I shot this movie on VHS from my uncle, when a bunch of old movies he'd bought when Atari was new was destroyed. I just saw her last night and it was not really bad, it was weird. I mean, everything that happened to Sybil Danning, who walked in three directions with two of the werewolf minions, was just out of place and quite disturbing (but quite hot), Christopher Lee about killing a dead karen as if be a vampire, etc. , this movie was actually a kind of mish-mash by Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except for werewolves, because what Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) was saying about werewolves destroyed by any other vampire movie in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die at night, and the Werewolf ruler lives in TRANSILVANIA). not much to do, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie, I found myself rooted for the werewolves to tear her throat, because that curse always had to tell YOU. However, the plot is rather stupid and clich√©, so there is no real point to tell you, you can just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, the things that make me hard about this movie is that it is the only movie in all seven sequels that is in any way the original (without counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of his original, in other words, a continuation of the same novel). so you do not see this movie. there is no real horror, hardly a werewolf, and just horrible special fx. 3/10
