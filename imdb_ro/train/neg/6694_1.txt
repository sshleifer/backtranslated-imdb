I had hopes for this movie since I saw Kari in a few other things and I think he has a talent. Unfortunately, this duddy is a case study of not doing in a scenario. Characters completely undefined, with no resemblance, no plot. Is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? Movie makers have no idea, and we do not.
