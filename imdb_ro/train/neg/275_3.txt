It's absolutely incredible to me that anyone can comment that this movie is not preached. It is not just a sermon, but an absurd, scenic, dramatic, righteous and painful overworked wall. Looking at it, it feels like an 8-year-old child being punished to write "I will not become a fascist" on the board 100 times. Now I understand that it was done during the height of the WW2 and intended to be a courageous condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought (whoever he would have applauded with all my heart) and I'm sure he captured exactly the mood of the day. But it is presented in an immense and obvious manner, but it does not succeed as a work of art. The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a heroic tactile anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson, as the rich grandmother who tries to figure out how dangerous the world has become. Although their uneducated education has placed them at all kinds of difficulties, children are awesome as small snips with well-rooted behavior. It does not even resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is so dimensionally noble that I cracked it every time it was on the screen. With each word, each of her gestures has the role of conveying how supportive and understanding she is to the Sacrifice her husband has to do and the great CAUSE she is fighting for, that she must have been tied to a painful electrical shock if she dared gave any hint of doubt or shadowing to the surface in her portrayal. So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT movie, just not a very good one.
