1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and appeared in more than 30 movies! While most of these films were not particularly good, they offered him the chance to slowly develop the character of the screen. However, through this film, the familiar Little Tramp was still developing. Surely Charlie watched the side, but his character did not yet have the sweetness and decency he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often struck, hit or did other ugly things for people for apparently no reason at all. As far as this very little film is concerned, it is interesting to watch for distribution. While they are not familiar today, Chaplin plays with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all of the popular stars with Keystone. The problem with this movie is that, although it has some beautiful scenes, the plot seems very vague and inappropriately developed. Chester and Mabel arrived on the racing track (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it must have been located near a racing track). Charlie and Mack look and creep. Mack is being watched by the police for doing so, while Charlie hits Chester and steals the girl. Finally, for no apparent reason, the policemen take Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who did not seem suppressed by Charlie's strange behaviors). a huge story of comedy or film history, this is a very forgotten film, which is only important in Chaplin's evolution. What he and other actors do on stage, while not unusual for a Keystone movie, is not particularly fun when he's seen today.
