I look forward to seeing this movie when it's out since I was a huge SNL fan. When my friend and I came to see him, the people who left the show shouted, "Do not waste money!" But, of course, we had to find out for ourselves. While there were a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of it felt as if a funny 1 hour show could be edited. It was pretty bad. When the opera singer appeared, many people got up and went out. This made me laugh, because I realized that O'Donoghue was just putting people's buttons on this movie. Or else he was crazy. Anything - you do not have to waste your time watching it, it's so bad.
