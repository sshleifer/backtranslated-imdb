Here is a movie with good distribution and a beautiful location, but it does not. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How well was PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed moving slowly even during slow-moving scenes. This movie was supposed to be accelerated, if not something else. That horse hunting seemed furious for me and the obvious rubber tracks in the deserts of the desert - just lazy. unworthy work. Sin. The actors did well, but we certainly saw that they all did better. Ben Johnson is always a joy. I first saw this movie almost 30 years ago; was disappointed and stayed at the second view after 30 years.
