... so I thought I'd have a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see him in his stout whites - it's obvious he's pumped for that role and looks pretty stupid in them - or less. There is an extended sequence in a cave where it must be given up to drums. There's a nice little thing to watch Miss Eleniak in his combs, just with his hands crushed over his bust. William McNamara is naturally little on the weak side, but he has a beautiful and generous handful of prey. There is also a moment when you get out of bed that if you interrupt the action at the right time, you can see the whole enchilada. If you are inclined to do this and do yourself, half of those who choose to watch a movie about marines on a "road trip" are. I'd like to thank Dennis Hopper for his free nudity. Can William McNamara act? Hi, if I know.
