Rather than long dance sequences and close to the characters who made the film shoot - the film would have been better served explaining the story and the motivations of the characters. Marginalization of Nubo, the minister, the aunt - and the restraint of the dynamics and rivalry IMPORTANT between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the film have no real depth. If you have not read the book, you would not have understood why Sayuri loves the president and why Mameha has become her mentor at all. From a visual point of view, the movie was amazing - and the actors did all the best with C written, but that was all that was good about this movie.
