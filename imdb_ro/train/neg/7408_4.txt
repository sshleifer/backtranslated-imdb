I'm not sure why I clicked on "contains a spoiler," because quite honest there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough about what is supposed to happen to ruin it. From the visual point of view, most offer. Well, apart from the rubber monsters in the 1980s. I will now say that before watching this, I have never seen Lordi before, and I did not know anything about them that they won Eurovision. It seems that the monsters in this group are members of the band, quite a lot in their stage characters. Regardless. Anyway, I did not know that while I was watching. I thought the monsters / demons were generally acceptable. Close. I'm almost sure there's a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it would be better not to know that. Perhaps it would have been incredibly brilliant to come to think of it. The action continues to roll pretty well to keep the viewer fun for the most part, even if half of the entertainment joke about the WTF is supposed to happen exactly in this movie. first of all because I had a good laugh in it, especially from the way it explains pretty much nothing. It must have been the mood we were in, but I realized you were funny for some reason. Then I search for the movie on the internet and find that NOBODY knows what the hell it should be about. That made me more amused and increased my score by half an extra point to 4/10. It's not scary or very coherent, but it's quite visually beautiful and sonic. Generally, far from being essential, but traceable. Do not wait too long and do not expect to make any sense and you might have fun if you have the right mood.
