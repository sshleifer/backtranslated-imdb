this movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it's also more graphic than both and not as good as none. It is also slow and fairly predictable. They also received the shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get a new blend of age-old flavor, and some of these scenes come as a motivational / inspirational sermon. Indeed, this film is a mixture of almost everything. Although it is bad, the effects of makeup are not very realistic. in fact, looks pretty cheap. Apart from all this, there is a rather horrible dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point where a few actions of the character were not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. no one in their mind who would have acted in this way. When you look at the movie, you will know what I mean. There is also free nudity for sake.it nudity. It simply was not necessary. The good news is that acting really was pretty good. better than this movie deserves s.so, after carefully weighing the evidence, I say that this movie was acceptable but not good.my verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 4/10
