The film is very terrible and is deformed to the victims of rape. On the surface, it can be a bold movie about rape, but if you get saturated under the surface, what lie is such a positive message about rape. Aishwarya rape victim turns out to be a helpless victim who can not deal with everyone because she is a WOMAN. She needs a man to help her. When society makes jibe about it and casts comments on it, it does not oppose it. Everything left Anil Kapoor to do everything he talks while Aishwarya is still crying. The director (Satish Kaushik) fell in the wrong way, portraying a rape victim as weak and obedient. What would have been more effective would be a strong woman who rebelled against her enemies in a brave way. The director is renowned for being a chauvinist. His films are usually full of weak women but try to hide them in controversial roles. He has to learn that just because the role is controversial does not mean that the character itself is strong. The most degrading scene in the movie is when Aishwarya "cleanses" after being raped. She makes her like his dad, who thinks he's dirty now. While it is commendable that Shah shows the stigmatization of the rape victims in such a powerful light, what does not show is whether Ash's father mistakenly made his daughter do such a thing. So we are left with a confused message about rape. Comedy too is not needed in a movie with a strong subject like it. Even more, the comedy is not funny. The ash is made of wood in its role, while Anil Kapoor only shouts. The music is mediocre, with the exception of the title song, which is beautifully painted (the only bright spot of this film). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and useless. On the whole, what could have been a wonderful movie to remember, ends up being a terrible mish-mash that will give viewers severe indigestion.
