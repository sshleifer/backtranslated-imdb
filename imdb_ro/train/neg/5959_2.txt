A spoiler. What three words can guarantee you a terrible movie? Canadian cheap production. The BRAIN fits perfectly with these words. The terrible scenario, idiot act and hilarious special effects make this a necessity for every fan of the BAD movie. Horror is hilarious. The post-production team seems to quit. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, actually trying to be good! Can a little ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? It's around Christmas time. Mom and daughter are killed by one of the most amusing villains ever. A day later, a rebel teenager is in enough trouble to send him for a psychiatric analysis. If a policeman is cut and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody ax told you some kids did it, who do you think? What begins as a funny becomes boring and tiring until the end when the BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be afraid of scary moments. BRAIN is a very fun concept to try and be rocky. The Institute of Psychological Research is bigger than the major production plants! Our nasty villain and his cohorts are enjoying betraying some of the worst acts I've ever seen. The discretionary vision has been very much advised.
