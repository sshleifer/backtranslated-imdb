Practically, a dental spouse and her three daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the drive is good, and the music, though sometimes sudden and dire, is quite cold. The problem is the plot. The husband's dentist takes his wife off the stage in front of a performance before the show (she has a minor role) and then returns to give her something but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his agitation about this episode, his visual hallucinations and an alter-ego macho (Denis Leary, his former patient) and his fear of confronting his wife, because he will not have to "do something about it." I will not tell you the end, but let me say that the movie does not go anywhere and that the end is like a stutter. The characters' reasons are missing: why does he insert them? She is a decent dentist, good father. The film does not say. Who does it? Do not expect any response. Why does she want to keep marriage in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose are all children vomiting? Where is this movie going? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic relief) are completely wasted by this nonsense who does not know if she wants to be American Beauty or a family movie. A root canal is more interesting. Avoid it.
