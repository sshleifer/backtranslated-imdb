To be honest when I first heard about this show, though it would be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes for themselves, but it is the exact opacity. I realized that this show can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in real life, it does not mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotypes, looking at the show where ordinary people will realize that although there may be bad Muslims, it does not mean we are all bad , we just try to live 1 day at a time, as it was difficult for Amair to get on a plane and using words like "Blow up" or Yaser saying that we will eliminate the competition and that people have taken it in a plane, in the wrong way. Being a Muslim knows that things like this do not usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not the right thing. people will see how we are badly treated by watching this show and could make them think about how they act. I'm glad a show like this came in the air. There are many shows about the fact that people in Piotr Muslims as terrorists, many people find it funny for my opioid it's ok to do it from time to time, because prety much is fun about who we are saying that you can not have fun this is unfair, but it is often done and gives the Muslim people a bad name.
