This unpleasant video was initially banned in the UK, and was allowed in November last year without cuts. This includes Playboy Playmate of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening runs between Buchfellner and the jungle images in the fog. I'm not sure what purpose it was. It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene. Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the jungle for redemption. Peter (Al Cliver - Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her redemption. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass productive time, while another (Werner Pochath) constantly shouts. The redemption exchange goes to hell, and Laura enters the jungle. Will Peter save it before cannibals eat? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a bad movie! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very comfortable naked. Peter leaves and goes alone to find Laura, which has been captured so far. They take time when they have sex and do not see the danger that is approaching. Guts, anyone? A great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, decapitation, courage, a lot of full front, a great gig of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess) and the line "They removed the heart", which is hilarious if you see the movie.
