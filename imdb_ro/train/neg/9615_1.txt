It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he did his own! The things he chose to leave were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy that he chose to leave some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and disturbing. I do not want to say anything scary about the actors, but I can not act! Dickens is hard, of course, but that's pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a 19th Century Kramer, and even less about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful BBC adaptation of 1999. Regarding the writer of the script, I think he read Cliff's notes!
