Television influences society ... just look at increasing the popularity of cappuccino shops, after deciphering this little shallow work. In addition, real people who look as good as these people have no problem. In addition, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a beautiful Manhattan, given what they do? NBC just likes to insult the spectator's intelligence, even if it's around Gump's level. I know a person who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 per month rented. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Phriends, where are six ugly nobodies in dead jobs who live in a lively neighborhood, where the mermaids constantly cry and someone is beaten every week ... and then the owner raises the rent. Now that I look.
