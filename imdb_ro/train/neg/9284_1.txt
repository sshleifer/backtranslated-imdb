Man, even Plan 9 in outer space is better than this film. This move does not have enough plot for half an hour, but has managed to extend it for an eternity of over an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those exaggerated battle scenes, but things like Fong Sai Yuk's Legend are much better than this bad thing, which would be better to stay unimpeded.
