I probably do not give this movie a proper move, because I could not see everything. Perhaps if I had seen it in a theater, in the original presentation, I could have appreciated it, but it seems to me too slow. I read the book 25 years ago and the details of the plot disappeared from memory. This did not help the movie, because it is something less than vivid and clear in presenting the events. This is actually four linked movies or a four-part film and was, I think, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be nice enough, but all I could do to stay in the second part, which draws endlessly. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, its bright writing overcomes any problem you may have with the rhythm of the story. On the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being weighted. I have other problems with the parts of the movie I've seen. It's very splash, with a lot of hey-me-looking-at-this camera that draws attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story. Clearly, I miss something, but I just could not summon the enthusiasm to start Part III and IV.
