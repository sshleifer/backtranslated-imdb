This movie does not deserve even one. This was a total waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spool is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is complete front nudity and disgusting language. But not only there is no line of plot, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are little time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I hired it was for Brian van Holt (who only received one fifth of the second part, by the way). I think this was a mistake on the parties of the directors and publishers, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence. A movie like this is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie in life. There is no parcel line and it's not funny. Though not trying to be funny. YOU DO NOT KNOW MOVIE.
