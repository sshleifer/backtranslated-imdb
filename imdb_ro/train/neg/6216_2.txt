9, the movie we waited Monday was a little more than a disappointment. I was deeply surprised by the lack of story and the strange development of the character. All the wonderful sequences of action in the world do not cope with a single unimaginable character. <br /> <br /> Strange, almost thrown into occult sequences, not only were outside, they were angry. The story is about robots and scientists ... why suddenly it turns into a necromonian horror, with mystical symbols and ghost lines of green magic instead of giving answers to what could have been extremely frightening stories? > How, why, why, why ... questions that ask questions only if you care and become less and less likely to do how you get out of the theater. <br /> <br /> A movie like this is frustrating due to lack of depth .... I would look at this pencil-drawn film if the story was good. But the directors relied on the magic of CGI and Tim Burtons to attract the crowd. Which ... was what attracted me, but it failed to gain my respect. 9 could have been great ... with a few rewritings and a little more respect for its creators.
