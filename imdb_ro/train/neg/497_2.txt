This is a very bad movie. It could be fun with interested aliens and country setting, but it's simply not. Some strangers hear the War of Worlds broadcast when a country country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act badly. The front cover of the film shows that these aliens are surfing in surfing space in space ... not exactly what they do. They are not party strangers, they are stupid idiots, with modulated high voices. The stranger with the most tolerable voice is also the extraterrestrial Jack Nicholson, who always wears his sunglasses. Aside from strangers, the act is terrible. The writing is obviously intended for children, because each character is written as a child. This is a bad movie that only children will appreciate, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 100 minutes. PG for light language.
