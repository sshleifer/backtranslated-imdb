Ridiculous. 9-year-old Angelica, Annakin, turns into a 19-year-old boy, Annakin, who somehow seems appealing to Amidala, 5 years old. Now a 22-year-old Jedi warrior, Annakin has a few bad dreams and is about to sacrifice his children, his friends and his entire existence because a crazy old man convinced him to bring his third wife precious in and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity square. I think people who like this movie do not pay attention. The story is ridiculous. Characters are incredible (literally, not feeling perverted by "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.). Obi-wan Kenobi was wise and good anchor for the whole series, but in climax, he hacks Annakin's feet, let burn in the lava, and let him suffer. Does not anyone think it's a bit of a character? Not to mention that it was bad enough to get a chance to live, as it turns out. I was expecting at least one story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. Nothing here. The story could have been written at the age of 10 years. Oh, yes, the CGI is pretty cold.
