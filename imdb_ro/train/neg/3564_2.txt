Pet Sematary, though an 80-year-old horror film with a beautiful director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian ZEDER film by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King copied almost all the ideas of this director (the Zeder movie was made before King wrote the book). The cat, the earth, everything copied, this is a plagiarist case, but Stephen Kind a famous American writer , it is normal for him to escape this, obviously due to the enormous difference between Italian films of this kind, which contain nothing (and, in part, it is stupid in itself ...) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati.
