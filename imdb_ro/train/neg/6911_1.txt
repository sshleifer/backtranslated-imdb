What a bunch of dung. Shot-on-video (REAL crappy video camera, NOT digital) dumbbell. It is no doubt the most stupid thing ever done. The fact that this carp was actually released is completely asian handicap tips paid. Everyone who sees it will be bad for seeing it. Seriously. I felt he killed more brain cells after I saw this garbage. Positive reviews of this carp were made obvious by the "director" (and I use the term FOARTE LOAD) and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would really like this loss of life. Believe me, stay away from this video. You will thank me for this. Avoid it like a herpes.
