sincerely, where can I start! It was a low budget, the HORRIBLY movie acted, it was so amazing that it made us all laugh at how lazy it was! the battle scenes of the sword were not even sword beats, they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart, and all they were doing was just trying to make it seem like they were fighting! My family and I had a mood for a great action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was The Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looks so good, but when I looked at her home, I was actually born after the first scene. Oh and the plot of the film, the story, the script, etc. from garbage I do not even know why the director and the producer have just lost his time by doing it! But if you encounter this movie, you do not get it !!!!!
