This "movie" is such a bad work! Nothing seems to even try to be realistic. The plot is weak, acting - miserably, actors who wonder around like in a first year production, trying very hard to act without a chance from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for all those interested, including the public. Like in any thriller, there are murders, dead bodies and blood. Imagine just someone who, five minutes ago, committed a knife murder and went out calmly and smiling, not to mention a whistle, as if the throat was thrown by a virtual agent. This crime also had to be done by a small, fragile woman on a tall man, and she cut her throat! He prayed, politely, to bow to her? Much more stupid of the same kind happens and letting the audience wonder if this would be a joke that just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another huge problem, for example: The impatient and hungry bridegroom is in bed, waiting for the bride to leave the bathroom and after a long time, asleep (!!!). The next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception area, asking them for landscapes for landscapes! IS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE LAST NIGHTS ??? Such a waste of time even to try and write about this "low-low-low" movie.
