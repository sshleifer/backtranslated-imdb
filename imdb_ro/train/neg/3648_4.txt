A couple without children (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to try to conceive it. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that there is something wrong with the baby ... The pretty interesting idea is made in a bad scenario - the basic idea is fine, but it becomes amazingly predictable towards the End. I saw every twist coming. Direction is weak - does not seem to have any idea how to draw a basic scene. Production values ​​are - be nice - bad. Very strange. And the gore scenes are too unpleasant (almost stopped when a pregnant woman started stabbing her stomach) with unpleasant special effects. The film unfolds completely at the end, when it becomes very clear that they had no idea how to end this movie. Some good actions make it somewhat bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are good at their roles and kept me looking, but that's about it. This movie was barely released in 1991 and remains unknown - it's easy to see why. I give her a 4.
