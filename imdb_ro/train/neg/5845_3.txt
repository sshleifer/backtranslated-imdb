after seeing this, I can say it's not the worst movie ever done, yeah, people are worse than this, there are some good points for the movie, you can watch drunk teens, have horrible deaths, and cute rats who eat a scientific experiment and grotesque grooming, the "drunken caretaker," the butcher doctor, and giving a girl in underwear who has absolutely no shame, stupid Jocks, I could not personally expect the rat to eat on these drunken fools , I was rooted in the rat for a while, had a good premise, the first part of the movie, it was interesting, however, with the scientific explanation of the rats, but I think it was destroyed when the drunken teenagers excited by the bats come into play, the rat in my opinion, the one who is lost, her name is Brenda, it was so fake, it must have been a cGi rat, she looked like a guy dressed in a beaver suit, it was quite schlocky, blades, but not absolutely horrible,
