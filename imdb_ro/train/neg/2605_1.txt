Although I have recently put this on the list of the worst 10 movies, I have to say that it's probably not worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or any of the "Look Who's Talking" sequels. Still, it's pretty tough, even if sexy Drew Barrymore plays something of a horror film for Holly Golightly, who moves from New York to Los Angeles, but finds out that he's being followed by a killer look. Poor Sally Kellerman, a strange actress of great appreciation in the 1970's, is reduced here in an unbearable role, and Barrymore's man, George Newbern, is the worst kind of sitcom actor, always returning to a laugh after each line. The picture is humorous, but Drew's showcase turns out to be good, and the identity of the psycho (though even from a Scooby Doo episode) is interesting. But as for the finals ... be real! Who had to clean that mess? * from ****
