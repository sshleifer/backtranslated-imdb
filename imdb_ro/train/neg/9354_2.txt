There is a key aspect of the movie Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You do not have to tell the public what to think, because they will see it. The action here is interwoven with some of the most harsh narratives that have been unleashed on the unsuspecting audience - the purple prose of the fifth delicate one. And it should be useless because it's a fine piece here and some nice and beautiful pictures shot and shot. Perhaps Jobbo felt that the basic story needed some support. And maybe she was right, she does not have a basic credibility: in the '70s, Edinburgh was not exactly full of beautiful girls, inclined for the Velvet Underground, and a weak point for a passing sociopath. From too dressed and wearing clothes that carry the character of cod intellectualism, trying to unite them all, it's too well prepared for my taste.
