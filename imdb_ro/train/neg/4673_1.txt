I like the books of Henry James and Washington Square was no exception. I was really excited to see a new movie coming out based on the book of that title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the main roles. Albert Finney is miscast and does not play well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid and insipid role. The real problem and what's missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, furious and extraordinary boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialogue than a Pinter game. In the book I felt a profound care for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like breathing if her aunt had a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. Look if you can not sleep, it's a definite snoozer. You do not watch him if you're depressed. You will need Zoloft after this. Sure, "The Heiress" was exceptional with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in title roles. The actor who interpreted his father was the unfortunate and bad father ... still grieving for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The movie was not faithful to the book, but none is that. This movie was a box-office flop. I do not doubt why.
