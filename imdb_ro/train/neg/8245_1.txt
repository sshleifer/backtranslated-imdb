I can not believe no one liked this movie. I saw a lot of low-budget indie films, but that was absolutely sucked. Low budget does not mean that the movie has to be demented. Horror does not mean the movie has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a gore-fest, and one very disturbing to that. The actress was average, considering they did not hear about the actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The movie tries to disappear as "artistic" or something. This is not one of those excellent indie films that cost only thousands of dollars but they are incredibly well made. This was but an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on the film. Other comments also said that the soundtrack was sucking ... because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the film's writers. There were no redeeming qualities at this film at all. A total loss of my time and money.
