Even though an animation movie has really bored everyone under the age of 6. As a grown up that grew up in an area with native wild and native american horses, it felt like it was a mixed PC mix with too many fantastic movies created by people who have never lived in the area they filmed. Discuss with those who lived on the horse back, most treat their animals as family members, regardless of the background. Regardless of the background, we have dealt with good and bad hunters of wild horses. I had to explain that it was a real life issue for us vs movie maker views in children who were surprised to see how the PC showed a world different from what they really knew. the normal custom of disney or dreamworks of cute animals speaking burning the screen was visually beautiful old. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you can get questions.
