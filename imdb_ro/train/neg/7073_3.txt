We have an average family. The father is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious adolescent daughter", the adopted white baby and the cute baby. And we have a careless caretaker, what show did such a home have? Do we have a bastard Brady? Hurray! When it first came out, I thought it was very cool, especially because I was young. The music was bad. The rabbits were so bad and they were too g-rated. All his kidnappings were related to his family and his friends and his problems. The father was a daddy type "Danny from Full House". He always gave me the advice. But it was not a strange thing. They had a home for that. Remember? The parcels were basically Lil 'Romeo was in a kind of trouble or ... not so. Oh and maybe a preteen drama. Yes, these things are good. Not realy. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
