Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and that's what she wanted ... Yeah ... I look at this show when I was in college ... it was mindless, fun and somewhat action-oriented. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were nice; no one was killed or even hurt bad ... it was like a cartoon to come to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? It does not work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story and the performances are weird ... almost annoying - they're definitely not the true characters ... it's like a crazy TV game and it takes over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I was EMBARRASSED watching a movie. What did they think? I can best say that it must have been for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is let him die a quick death. It makes the Dukes of Hazzard look like the Masterpiece Theater ... I think the only remake you let me make of TV is Gilligan Island ... Good luck!
