Of all the movies (and I'm a graduate of the film, if it's worth something for you), this is the biggest movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse things out there that I have not seen yet, but I've seen that, and that's the worst. A friend and I rented it one night, because Denise Richards was on the cover. She talks about being young and late. It's unbelievable! Her role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the cover! IMDb is not even included in her filmography. This movie was so bad, I wrote a little note at the video store when I turned it back, and slipped it inside the case. Read something like "Please save our customers further from having to see this complete and bad movie!"
