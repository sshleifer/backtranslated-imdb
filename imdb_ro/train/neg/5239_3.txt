I have seen this movie based on the very favorable reviews that I have read here by others. They certainly saw something in this movie I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The film starts at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it is interesting, then begins to collapse and drain, not to say completely unbelievable. Finally you will find "How far will it go with this?" Dad begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, enters a delight to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new shopkeeper, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This seems a bit more, but wait, it's more. John gets completely obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make a logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful loving girl, a safe, well-paid place, a beautiful home, a beautiful car, costumes expensive - wants to be a loser that Auggie Rose was and is experiencing life in a poorly paid job, living in a pit with a sweet girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people. Why this childhood mindset has had a favorable review, I will never know. Sure Goldblum does a good job - he always - and his looks have improved with age - but if you do not have a great love with Jeff Goldblum and you have to see every movie he's in, I would not recommend this turkey. It's about two hours of your life, you will not come back - and believe me - you have no reason to thank you when you have finished the two hours, otherwise than be thankful you do not sit there! <br /> <br />
