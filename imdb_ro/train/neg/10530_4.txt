Disappointing the musical version of Anna Margaret Landon and King Siam, shot in 1946 by Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, Deborah Kerr was distributed as a widow and mother traveler from England to Siam in 1862 to accept the job as a tutor the children of the king - and probably to teach the royal one or two in the process! The Stagy image starts well, but quickly loses energy and focuses. Yul Brynner, resuming his stage triumph as a king, is a commanding presence, but is used as a buffoon on the thoughtful story. Kerr keeps his cold dignity and better prices, despite the fact that he has to miss the voice of Marni Nixon. Perhaps he has already played this part to death, Brynner seems to have left nothing to translate the screen apart from the bombardment. The second half, with Anna and the bars that make a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cab", is ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs are mostly timber. Brynner has won the Best Actor Oscar, but Kerr is the one who kept this chuck over the water. Too long, heavy and "old-fashioned" in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****
