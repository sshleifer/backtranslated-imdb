Seriously, I've read some reviews about this movie and I have to ask if you're people watching the same movie. Yeah, I give television directors a lot of money to be able to recreate Los Angeles in the 1930s, but what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are pleasant, the story seems pointless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just stupid. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had the creepy child actor, sneaky Billy Barty and so on. those movies love the cinemas and the others look at each other and we go, "What the hell!"
