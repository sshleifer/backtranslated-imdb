If you think the original version of 83 was bad, then try this modern masterpiece. How bad would it be to ask you more? Well ... at least in the first, you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. In addition to updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley, unfortunately, this is the same sad sad story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line of the story followed. And for anyone who did not see the first ... consider yourself lucky that you only saw it once. Perhaps in another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
