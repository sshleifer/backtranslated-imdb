Incubus is a mix of the good (a mysterious murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected scenario, unwanted resolution, stupid attack scenes) and strange (powerful incestuous, strange sleeping rigid performance by John Cassavetes - was that character really meant to be so "wacko"?). It is not as offensive as the reputation of being, but not a great success. (* 1/2)
