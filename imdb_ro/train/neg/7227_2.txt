While others may argue that by watching other Bilal works, someone will appreciate this movie better, it fails in a major way. Do not stand alone. The plot is a mishmash that confuses symbolism with substance. Here's an idea that begins with a definite story. Then the symbolism of the craft around it. We begin with two different narratives, this woman that turns into a man in a way, a "god" who, for some reason, is judged but gets a last blow on Earth and this mysterious John character who seems to develop a kind of "" even beyond the borders of the city. Why? None of these questions are answered. But we care, no. There is no evolution that wants to empathize with any character in the story, the more we receive Jill and even then the development is at best. Unfortunately, the film is captured in the entire visual impression (what it is,) but on the motivational development. I would love to see that this has been rewritten by someone who could distance himself from the material a little and he does not have to feel that every picture must be in the picture.
