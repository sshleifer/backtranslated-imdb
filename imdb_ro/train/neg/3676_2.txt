Susan Swift is an appealing young woman, a baby child transplanted in the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she does not have enough vocal range for a dramatic walk and tends to be crying; however, it's pretty sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile. In the movie "The Coming" (as it was called when it was briefly released in theaters), Swift can be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. Flick is very cheap and borrows from many other pictures that I have over it with about 15 minutes to go. He starts strong and has an appeal in the camp. Obviously, there are several serious films dealing with the Salem witch studies that deserve to be seen over; however, like junk go movies, is not too terrible. The local Boston regions are a clear addition, and the support is fun. * 1/2 from ****
