If you've seen other movies of this kind, they probably are better. The Omega man comes to mind. For the credit of the studio, they avoided the useless, useless, large-scale technoprophyles that typify the films of this film. In addition, the configuration and premise were excellent: four people, whose past are almost irrelevant to us, are trying to get rid of an overwhelming disease of infectious diseases. What is wrong is something else! I'm sick of bitter, bad, negligent, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. This pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I hired her and I woke up again, shouting on television: "No, do not do that!", "Why are you so stupid", "take care!" And so on. A real lack of character development is evident at halfway point. A movie should give you a strong personal touch with at least some of the characters, so take care of what's going on with them. It is not. Also, there should have been a longer and more involved film.
