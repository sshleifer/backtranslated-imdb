With the release of the film "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry really hit the rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​lived in the last years a calm life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day, an old friend of Stefan comes up with a favor to ask him. Stefan has to make a small courier service. He should bring a heroine suitcase through the customs of Sweden-Germany. Unfortunately, things in Germany do not work as planned, and Stefan is now in great trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family tradition. Unfortunately, if people involved in production have no idea how a movie should be written, filmed or cut the result can be just catastrophic. Content can be terminated with: bad action, incoherent plot, and idiotic dialogues. The only attraction of the movie is the unprovoked sex scene with Queen Lund incredibly beautiful. This only takes a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes pure, let's say what it really is, shit.
