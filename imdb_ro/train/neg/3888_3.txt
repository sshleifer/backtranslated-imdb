I started melting, so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. There's the astronaut and climbing into a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to the radiation and then when they return ... well, it does not matter what happened to the others, but our astronaut started to melt! No, do not just burn, but MELT! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. Anyway, he gets all red and gooey, and the fact that he melts makes him very upset. I think he also checked the "melting man" manual, because suddenly he knows that, in order to totally avoid melting, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts to destroy people out. other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is who will still eat, and what will be left to them? How long will it take for him to melt away? Why was this movie made first? Where did they get the money? Since when do you fall asleep while you look at it? I have melted a lot, but I still have time to tell you that this movie is boring of horror, even if the idea is very good and nice of the gross. Makeup is clean, but everything is ... SPLAT
