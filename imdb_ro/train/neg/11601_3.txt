A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dreamy Child, the fifth installment of the Nightmare series on the Elm Street series and the worst sequel in the series, even worse than a nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was lucky enough to get the nightmare on the Elm Cutie Street DVD set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels. The dream child was the worst of no doubt, and I was surprised that they did so well with the last two sequels. But I think they just lost the charm, the story was just ridiculous and I did not enjoy where it went. Alice has just become more annoying, not Nancy or Kirsten, so she wore this movie on her own did not go for me. Freddy is also losing his scarecrow, this was just a little stupid. Alice is back and she bears a baby, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is back and it will not be too easy for her, since she defeated it so easily in her fourth film. But anyway, she wants her baby and be born again in the world. Have you ever wondered if Freddy had parents? Well, that's what a nightmare on Elm Street: the dream child is investigating, and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood is and maybe that's the only thing that can defeat him. A nightmare on Elm Street: The dream child is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Only the story was really bad, I mean it could work, but once again, it was just executed in the wrong way. I know if you want to see the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should look at it, but I would not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> </ p> <p> 3/10
