The field of the gaming house is the most powerful thing: the successful author and psychologist is condemned by a band of pussy but in discovering the evil part of her who enjoys the emotion of what they do, she finally takes revenge. It's about pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for meeting as a puppet. Mamet must be director: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and fairly diverse television and film career so she can not always do this badly. She had to go out of a bad, controlled, professional computer lady who was having fun, as shown by the change from a beige pants suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including lingerie body) to floppy flowers. But everyone seems to speak their lines in the same cut and precise way; I imagine that Mamet wants to make sure he has not missed a syllable of his sparkling scriptures. The effect is anxious and destroys the atmosphere of mystery and suspense that is supposed to be trying to create it. Sometimes the gaming house loses any connection with the way human beings behave or speak in fact and becomes just a mechanism to get out of the plot. The vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack also does not help. The end result is that the only entertainment that needs to be done is to guess the outcome and the quicker you will be, the faster you will be bored with robotic and two-dimensional performances. And smokes too much!
