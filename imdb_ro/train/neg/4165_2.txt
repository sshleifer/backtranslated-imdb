I'm a big fan of the camp, but when every plot "overturns" is predictable and bad, while obviously I'm not trying to be, I really lose interest. I had to record a 3, but the end easily dropped one point. His only saving salvation is that I hated other movies. There is not enough beer in the world for that.
