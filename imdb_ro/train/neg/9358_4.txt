From the moment the movie begins, there is already a discrepancy. Since this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East and is also an international film, it is expected that the accents will be portrayed. This is not done as most American sound expressed. Also, it seems to me that the act was repeated at best, the story line is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in suit and landscape. If you want to see a movie to feel like it was in the past (though lack of accents), then this movie deserves a rent. If you are looking for a film as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, then look elsewhere.
