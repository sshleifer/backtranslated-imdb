Add to the list of cartoons: A South Preacher and a "Congregation," a Squeeze Singer (Sophie Tucker?), A Dance Choir, and Brothers Mills - just do it worse. Contemptible burlesques of "black" performers, who often appear in movies to parody themselves and their race. Although the "black comedy" could have been accepted on the day, today it is extremely offensive and I doubt it has ever been fun. Although I would not have been offended, I do not think I was laughing at the humorous attempts. As a 11-year-old white boy, however, he may not have understood some of them.
