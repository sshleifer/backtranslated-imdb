I think this movie is based on a true story ... It's about two young girls molesting an adult man for 48 hours; I do not see the game of terror ... There are some "strange" and "surrealistic" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) play the roll of two psycho-mannequin killers ... they do a pretty good job (although some of them are just a bit over the top ). The movie is not good and not horrible, it really is truly dated! I mean, these things are getting strained by the '70s ... It's not really bad if you like something like that ... you know?
