There is really no way to beat around the bush saying that, Lady Death: The shooting picture is just stupid. Aside from the fact that the main character is a well-blonde who runs around Hell in a leather bikini on the occasion of violent graphic action, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of a cartoon of the 1980s based on series of action figures. The bad man even speaks like a wannabe skeleton, has a forced henchman and lives in a gossip that seems to have been modeled after the villain of Blackstar's old blackstar cartoon. Just do not expect anything but a sometimes bad dialogue. Sometimes it feels like the genre of anime more suitable for hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank you well!) And very little sexual appeal, despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count semi-naked heroin and bloody deaths. In essence, what we have here is a long-lasting episode of She-Ra, the Princess of Power, but with scarves and more gore.
