I know that some films (that is, European films), which are very bad films, are seen by some filmmakers by some "critics" just because they are not Americans. I saw 8.1 IMDB score for this movie and I noticed it was selected for some big festivals. Do not let that trick you! Unless you are one of those people who like the movies so many minds and call it a wonderful art afterwards, skip this! The movie contains a hilarious scene after another (a similar Italian film, my terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE broke in my mind (I prefer a sound of the sea)). The problem with these movies is that they are not just boring, like other strange movies, but almost playing as a camp. I mean, to face this, the act is horrible (I mean: at the soap level), the story does not have a surprise (this was done before countless intervals, linking several stories: SHORT COURSES, MAGNOLIA, much better), not a realistic character in it (some real freak-seeing along the way, observe the hilarious zombie daughter) and so on and so forth. As if this is not enough, the movie is 135 minutes. (count it!) and at the end the director opens his box of sentimentality. After a movie with such hilarious and evil dialogue that made the audience preview preview to laugh at such incompetence, well ... This is an insult to the cinema and gets only big ratings because it happens to be in - another language, in this Spanish case. The weird world we live in ... 3/10
