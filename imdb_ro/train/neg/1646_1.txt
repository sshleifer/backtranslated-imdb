I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but that was too much. The act was not great, but it was not the real problem. The problem was the feeling of diving that I brought into my stomach pit about 20 minutes into the movie. These characters were empty. They had almost no depth, and what few had been devoted to the cruelties they manifested to each other in the form of friendship. Exploring the dark parts of a set of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give the characters real characters or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were cardboard, and the image they gave was just ugly.
