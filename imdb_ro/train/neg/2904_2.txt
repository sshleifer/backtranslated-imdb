If in the first 10 minutes of this movie you do not realize that the main character, who writes a column of life tips, will have the tables - oh-so-intelligent-transformed and will learn some valuable life lessons, then it is probably something in wrong with you. The setting is so predictable that it destroys the movie even if the rest of the movie was good (which is not) There is almost no chemistry between Steve Carell's stalker and stalker The behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character would have any interest in him. Then, in the end, everything is wrapped up so great and everyone lives happily afterwards. It's not America so great!
