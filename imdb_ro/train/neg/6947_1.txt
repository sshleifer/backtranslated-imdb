Undoubtedly, one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women led to robbing the banks that we should feel somehow about. It's hard to sympathize with characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh, no, the cops are ours, we know who we are, what do we do? ... Let's still rob another bank, then we're out of here! What the!?! Every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who will be dead.
