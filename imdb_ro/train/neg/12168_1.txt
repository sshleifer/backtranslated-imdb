This movie was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a large number of bodies. The act was horrible. The killing was very bad. As if Ally was stuffed in the toilet, I think he was in the abandoned cottage. But when the end of the movie ends and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, you see Ally, so Angela should have entered her to bring her. The part that really made me was when the little girl and Angela were in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar string and pushed her. One was a horrible actor and two why did not you come back and beat yourself up? When Molly is being watched by Angela if you close, why do not you come back and stab? So stupid. This movie sucks ...
