I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie might be quite cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" said the trailer. Well ... it made me offend, because in reality this movie sucks. It's a tough comedy, because I laughed about two seconds during the whole movie. And what about all the homosexuals in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have a problem with those who are, but what is the purpose of adding so many gay scenes to a so-called comedy movie when these scenes are not absolutely funny? I think the director is a gay man in denial or something like that. So my advice to you is: if you want to lose good money, go for a good comedy you've seen for millions of times, you'll be better off than watching the movie Mother Of All Lousy. It's really total stupidity.
