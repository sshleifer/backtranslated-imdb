Spooks is a good trash, showing some well-targeted sequences, ridiculous parcels and dialogue, and a third rate of action. Many have described it as a British version of "24", and the likenesses can be seen. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the weak plots, but the execution is so much weaker, sexy and suspicious, expensive. Some people describe the poor comedy as "gentle comedy." <br /> <br /> This is a gentle hour of spy story, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. Give me the smile every day.
