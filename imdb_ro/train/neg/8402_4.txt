The Three Stoogi in a feature-length comedy? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was meant to combine Stooges' short comedy with Western music in a matinee; if so, it was a nice way to break off on an afternoon afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as Jun Blonde) and Gladys Blake (like Betty Brunette) are beautiful women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group; their songs are fairly thunderous; however, this is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the movie is not exactly "rock". There are a few laughs; but Stooges's humor brand is more subtle than usual. The speech horse is also insufficiently used. <br /> <br /> Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
