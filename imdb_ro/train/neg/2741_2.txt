Spoilere !! I love Branagh, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but HERE. I can understand the actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but indeed - the script they used to be, Bonham-Carter's clothes were tortured, and the occasional succession of the "wanderer" could have been an exit from the Beatles movie or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh - In. I never had a point - other commentators say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not proud. The business with the disguise of the robber bench was just painful to watch. Of course it's not funny. Bonham-Carter's realistic attempts (supposed to be realistic speeches) were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty." <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him tall on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his plane, was too orchestrated. Was there an angel choir or just a soundtrack? Go back to classics or something with a backbone and a bow to it. Donate this PBS. <br /> <br />
