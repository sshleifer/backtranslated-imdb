Anyone who does not know about the British film "The Wicker Man" in 1973 would no doubt have left the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peuri". As a devotee of the original left with the impression Purely Poor. From the bleak reality of hungry angel angels that forcibly force law and order into a pagan barbarian ritual network on a remote Scottish island called the Summerisle (the original) a colony near the Amazon on the Maine coast of the United States called Summersisle, the remake does not touch the place. This is, unfortunately, a case of what might have been a classic remake of a classic being manipulated to satisfy a simple-minded public. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the movie) Ladies involved ... hang your head in shame.
