Forgive me for it's obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes in these two major categories. Movies like The Godfather, Private Ryan Rescue and Star Wars slots are cozy in the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are movies that simply do not deserve to be named. However, occasionally, someone produces a really painful film. A movie that should be nominated as a demonstration of how horrible it can be a movie. A movie more than bad. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a band of wicked criminals who demand a ransom from a ship owner as bad and passionate. Of course, there is a complete American hero on board, complete with the cut jaw and the sculpted chest that saves the day. This is a production that brings new depths. Everything about it is bad. The action, the direction and the so-called plot are full of breath. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate spectator. Even an American spectator would be disturbed by his shortcomings. Yeah, it's so bad. I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that upset me about this movie. However, its cute conclusion of moves should serve as an appropriate example of what I mean. Imagine in your mind that you are a bad hunter and you are standing in a rescue boat open on a great calm. You are in the company of the hero who owns a bomb. This hero throws you the bomb and sinks overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I'd drop the bomb as much as possible into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero revolves and then tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Quite telling. Such a disappearance would deserve a mention on the "Darwin Awards" site and could also be a good conclusion to the life of the production team.
