Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be alone in this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also unpleasant and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew returns to the house where he grew up and offers the family that lives there, Valco's, $ 250,000 to be his "family" through the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but it is quite greedy to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say about this, but she learns to like Drew around ... not exactly that feeling with Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate), but that's what happens for change. Miss Missy's love (Jennifer Morrison) sees Drew and wants her people to meet their family. Genuine fun is in the store as a happy Noel becomes a hilarious dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedy, though weird.
