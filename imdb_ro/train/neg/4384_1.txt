The fact that someone has really spent money on such a bad scenario is beyond me. This must be one of the worst movies, in addition to the Haunted Highway I've ever seen. BAD actors and a very bad story. There are no normal reactions to any of the events in this movie, and even if it's Halloween, normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing the killing of their father, not to mention evacuees, band people covering the paths (in a room with at least 50 people I could add) and a man dressed while Satan dragged the dead in the house, even an 8-year-old would see the difference between a doll and one person. Not to mention that no one can be so naive and stupid to believe the reality of Satan and the appearances of Jesus on the same day as this child does. When I was eight, I had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that anyone else seems to fall for this Satan mute aspect also no question asked. The question throughout the film is: Is Satan really or is it a crazy person who kills people whenever he feels this? Well, he has human hands, arms, he built everything, so I think he should be in the movie, otherwise they did a terrible job to hide it. Then, with this person being human and completely, he managed to kill an old man, a man and a mistress, five policemen (all of them with guys and training suppose) and a few other people. .... and obviously, everyone just stood there, waiting for him, or what? The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen and I would never recommend anyone losing 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to follow this total shit.
