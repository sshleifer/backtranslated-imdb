The only thing that prevented me from vomiting after seeing this movie was that they are just actors and not the strange show that usually appears in the TV show. This is also the main reason why TV fans do not like the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has about the same entertainment value as getting a root channel. It approaches the depths of the abyss of the evil film, and then gets worse. I will not waste time describing this film in detail; it suffices to say that I am sorry that the good people of the camera that had to suffer, looking at the first time.
