I really do not understand how people did this movie and thought they deserve all the work they put into it. Even more tangled are those who watched this movie without feeling cheated in 88 minutes doing something worthwhile like cleaning under the sofa or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, it surely could have found two real Irish people and some beautiful women who could deliver their lines better than haggard porn starry streaked in this movie. Suddenly, the gorilla work - but strangely, it is not as horrible as you think you see organs removed from the left and right bodies of the pigeon body. Probably has something to do with the fact that, after their horrible act, you just want to die in pain. So if you do not care about the following: <br /> <I have never been a witness to this, everyone has sucked. <br /> <br /> -plot (some terrible movies are linear or at least surprising. The movie makes no sense unless you're just as trashed as the writers). <br /> <br /> - Theme (Nothing to learn from this film. Nothing you need to be scared in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or understand, or to explain it to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, shit, shit, music as usual and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - Landscape (It could have been the blessing to save this film, but not ... nothing good here, even the rocks are false). If you do not care about this, and you're just a horny teenager with a bad taste in music and "women," this movie is for you. Positive reviews: exciting movie moments, wasted on other elements. Gore very realistic; again, wasted. But the intestinal scene is classical. I agree with the move issue - solving the problem of false accent.
