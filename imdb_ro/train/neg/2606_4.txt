Drew Barrymore plays the role of young Holly Gooding, who moves with aspirant hacker writer Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disturbs his life by claiming that "doppelganger" or bad twins are about to kill her and her family They. <br /> This awesome horror movie is hard to take seriously, even though the filmmakers and actors themselves seem dead. The film "Doppelganger" is muddled, with an unpleasantly stupid dialogue. Some viewers will notice that the name of Drew's character is taken from Audrey Hepburn's role in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," and the name of Newbern's character is a play on behalf of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (actually trying to re-write "Breakfast "like a horror film, believe it or not!). I suppose it deserves credit because it's not quite your horror movie - I mean writer / director Avi Nesher seems to really care about his characters and give his film more plot than Slasher's standard tariff. After a stupid villain - explains everything - the audience's confirmation, the film continues to show a hideous climax that must be seen to be believed. This movie certainly does not get rid of the gore. But hey! Drew kills her mother in this. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore appears near the beginning just to be violently killed. Drew is always very watchful, and very sexy in this. Newbern comes as a kind of "cute" guy. But the highlight of the film must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in a single scene as a nun who started a sex business on the phone (!!!!!!). /> The film is basically junk, but rather funny on a low, sordid little level. <br /> 4/10
