Very useless movie with characters that act so careless that I did not care who would be the best (or was it the purpose of the film, to show some people who talk to New York fortunately?) No love here , no comedy. The actor is very flat and a very predictable plot. What made me most nervous was this constant joke with classic movie quotes. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less significant you become your own film? Try to be original! A small budget is neither an excuse nor the director for the first time. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder he only cost me a dollar ...
