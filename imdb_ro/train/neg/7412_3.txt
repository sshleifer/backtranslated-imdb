I like horror blows. I do not care if the act is sub-par or if the monsters look at the cornice. I liked this movie, except for the stunned feeling to the end of the movie. Look, I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a big letter to explain a plot. But Dark Floors take "what is this movie about?" work at a completely new (annoying) level. What is this movie about? This is not particularly frightening or thrilling, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to get frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
