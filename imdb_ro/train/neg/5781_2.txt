Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame is bothering me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I have not seen "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Any contribution to the film was completed more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and / or boring (Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, Gate IX, Pirates). Father R must have signaled the end of the unit when he came out. It's a luxury concept and quite high for a 1968 horror movie (never shows the baby). But this is just terrible comfort. Everything is artistic to the point where the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, due to the title that destroys the end), and on a clear day you can see that the end of the twist comes a few days. He did not support my interest. We have noticed that whatever this movie was, it is completely derailed by the 1960s version of what femininity was. Farrow is an unhappy, chronic, helpless woman / housewife. Her weakness is survived ... she irritates the extreme. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider but to be the devil's mother. Dakota is barely exploited for her strange potential.
