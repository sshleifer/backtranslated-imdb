In the recent move to bring Asian movies to America, this is the youngest film to be released here. Being a great fan of Asian movies of all genres, I surf the net and I've come across this soong to be re-launched on the American market, so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent it to a local video store. <br /> <br /> Believe me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely removed this movie from the water. Jet Li would fall asleep watching the battle sequences. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better with a shot of Jackie Chan! More ... Do you think you will watch a martial art with a girl swallowed in vengeance for the death of her parents, but SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is full of dialogue, an absence of action, the lack of destroying a tangent plot, almost nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director has never dedicated himself to adventure and yet has devoted some of the film to the problem. It would have been much better if he had cut that whole hour and developed the story by himself in another film and would focus on the aspect of martial arts. Speaking of that, I really do not think that Iron Monkey choreographer made the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted in the frequent use of slow movements and rapid camera changes to describe the physical speed of assassins. I just did not buy it. Please ... I warn you that you do not waste your time / money with this movie. The premise is intriguing, and the trailer may even tempt you, but I'm convinced that this movie is NOT suitable for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the states) and will be the worst film brought to the Asian film industry.
