From the creators of Shrek ... OK, that caught my attention. Well, Shrek's creators did Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. That means Flushed Away is not good. Animation and all those special effects were great, but the movie was not. The story of this film was intended for children only. It is not seriously possible for adults to actually love this movie. But there were many jokes for adults. I bet children understand jokes. Despite the fact that I like this movie. I'm completely disappointed. 4/10
