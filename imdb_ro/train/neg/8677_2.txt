I liked Chiba in Street Fighter and I thought hey, no matter how bad this movie will be, I'll meet at least to see him hit a bit, do not you? Wrong. This is a boring misery, disturbing of useless speech, scandalous writing and meaningless scheme. There are few scenes of action of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are shot and edited so badly that you can not even find out what's happening in the world. Oak is also atrocious, and perhaps the idiocy that is this film is best illustrated by the fact that it involves the Italian mafia ... EXCEPT it being Japanese! Avoid the plague - you better see the martial arts by looking through the local prehistoric karate class window for five minutes.
