When I received this movie for free from my service, along with three other similar films. I followed then with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad in itself. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, treason, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap emotions it's not that bad. I'm probably never going to watch this movie again. In short, this is the kind of movie you would see either very late at night on a local television station that just wants to take some time, or you'll see it on an afternoon Sunday in a post local television that is trying to take some time. In spite of bad actions, enemy lines and works under the camera. I did not want to stop the movie and claim that she never appeared in my DVD player. The story has often been made in many films. This is no different, neither better nor worse. <br /> <br /> Only your medium movie.
