I just got this movie for a dollar at National Wholesale Liquidators and after watching it, I feel like I was kidnapped. I do not know I saw a movie worse than that. Sincere. And I would never write a negative review of a movie if I do not have so much respect for the subject, that is, Stephen Foster and his music. First, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yes, many Foster songs have been interposed here and are the pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-like numbers that are more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone paid to write this? Secondly, Foster's REAL story is fascinating. Why do not you even get close to this? Third, what did the great Ray Middleton have to do to make this film? His pictures of little boys? With the Communists? What a loss of great talent. So, Foster's friends, the truth and good fun, be afraid ... be very, very, afraid.
