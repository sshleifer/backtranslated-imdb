I entered this film in the hope of the best. I like war musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did a good job with their roles; however, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The interest of love between the two had no real growth; she suddenly was there. I did not think too much about music; the best number was the piece I heard about Spike Jones with "The Face of Der Fuhrer." The only complete number that Spike Jones has had a bit of his great musical comedy; beautiful things, even with the monkey. The story of Bert Lahr's comedy was endless. Lucille Ball was quite amazing and there was a good selection of players who really deserved more time on the screen.
