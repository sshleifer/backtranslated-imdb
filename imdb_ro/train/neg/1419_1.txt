This is a terrible movie - and unfortunately, the company that did this has done more. The short is basically an idea with a joke that was not funny to start and can also offend you. They definitely made me uncomfortable looking at very young children (most of them appeared at the age of 2), cavorting and pretending to be adults - in this case, a dancing girl and bars. It's a kind of humor that you might be forced to laugh at your children if they pretend to be adults, but I do not see anyone who WANTTING to see - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in outfit and acts like a vamp !! And then, other children behave like adults in some rather adult situations. At that point, I'm sure they did not try to turn to pedophiles, but when I looked at her today, that's what comes right into my mind! That's why this boring movie took me out and I hope I never see it again! Pretty weird and pretty awful.
