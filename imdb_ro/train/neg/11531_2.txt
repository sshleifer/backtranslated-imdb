This plot is so manipulative, relying entirely on the most unsafe and inconceivable decisions of adults in each parental decision. Children are super good to the charm and delivery of lines, but, as I say, the whole plot depends on each adult being completely idiot and therefore in that case making more sense of their actions (and at the same time being the only way explain the actions of boys of total mistrust). Why are the charming little boys taking a child off the shore? How did the child reach the shore and, at the same time, explain that this is the last place to look for? Why two boys NEVER have been informed at the same time, a baby is missing no one gives a figure about them running around the food and diapers with all that agitation that happens literally in any other place searched ? There is no possible justification to ask the public to believe this. The demand to believe that it will be done at the trial (even at the informal level) is too insulting to be empty.
