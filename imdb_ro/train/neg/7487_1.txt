Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course using the script written by Neil Simon. For some reasons, the script from Neil Simons is not used in this movie, so it's unclear again. Even the audience we were with never laughed. The direction is very slow and boring, and when there is a joke, it is given away, so jokes die that couple who has sex in the park. They announce that it is a lighting ceremony for New York, you all know that the lights will come and we will be able to see the cute and wandering Goldie & Steve makes a little stick stick. The whole movie is spinning this way ... a joke is set up and given. Why Goldies hair is never embroiled in the movie. You will also notice each close to Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
