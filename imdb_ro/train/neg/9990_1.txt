Watching this film on the SciFi channel, I can conclude that this movie was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre events, or "delights", as the friend who reads over my shoulder told me. The plot is not worth much comment, but basically a football jet plane collapses in Yeti. Before the movie ends, we are treated to break your hearts as you try to run before jumping 50 yards, yetis breaking a man's legs and beating him with a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a cave, a yeti who survived several bullets and was put into the fire without any apparent evil, a yeti pinching off a cliff, holding the man's shoe, then jumping a collection of bizarre events. Basically, if you do not stay on a Saturday for the purpose of viewing the most serious original SciFi movies, avoid this movie as a plague. Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." Which friend on my right says: "Only techno fighting music could have done better."
