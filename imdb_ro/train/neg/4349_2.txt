This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a wonderful movie. Goodgfellas is only one of the best movies made. This movie should be considered closer to the STING Part2 area or maybe the speed zone. Remember the stones! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the pursuit of the cult of the original. This film did not have everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so much on. There was a good character and that is the fault of all those responsible for doing it. I hope RISE TO POWER can win every RAZZIE possible and maybe even invent some new categories to let it be a record holder. After watching this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat down and watched Carlitos' original way of getting my mouth off my mouth. After watching this, I wanted Pachanga to come and kill me from my misery.
