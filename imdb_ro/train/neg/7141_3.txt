Okay, so I went into this movie, which does not really wait long, I imagined a similar action to The Fast and Furious. Some beautiful cars some pretty girls, somehow a decent plot. Unfortunately, I should say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Do not misunderstand me that the cars were nice and the girls were okay, but the way they put the film together was simply great to say it nicely. The story never made you care about the cast, and the movie just seemed tied together. So generally this movie was not the worst thing ever by far, but if you're looking for a movie to go this weekend, I'd go over this for the moment.
