Everything that saw the original will have to come out and destroy this horrible remake. Alex Baldwin trying to mimic Steve McQueen's delay in a word for remake does not work. While Baldwin did an admirable job, it's a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, did not try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw, he said enough. McQueen looked dangerous, dangerous and credible as Doc, the film had emotions and suspense, Baldwin and the company did it in a comedy, we laughed the only time and saw this miserable movie. And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of today's most exciting and more credible actors! The makeup people had it for Michael, what they thought. If you want to see the movie as it was under the guidance of Sam Peckinpah Get the original!
