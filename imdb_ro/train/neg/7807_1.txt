I got this DVD at the Dollar Store. The DVD was 2 for a $ 1 rack, but since Michael Madsen was in it, I thought that since I did not see the movie, I bought it anyway. like the movie. The film was more like a documentary or publicity about religion than anything else. I discovered that using the flashback director did not add to the story line for me. I would have liked to see the story line in chronological order. I will not throw it like one of the other commentators, but maybe it would be long before I think of seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was the debut of Michael Madsen's film, it may have an archival value at a later date.
