Dream Elephants were supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it really did not miserably succeed. The movie is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A big problem with them, however, is the vast overflow of inflorescence. It's horrible though I think it helps to give the film a dreamlike quality. One thing we have to observe is the terrible acting voice. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's vocal actor is HORRIBLE. I think when you have a budget that actually rises to zero, you can not afford to hire real-world actors. For me it seems they have hired one of the animators to make their voice. On the whole, the movie does not work at all. For me, it seems to be more like a movie "Shows what we can do" instead of real movie. The land does not go anywhere and fails to show any interesting point. The entire movie resembles the fact that it was made as an excuse to make interesting areas. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be worth a quick download from the official website, but you do not expect anything except graphic graphics.
