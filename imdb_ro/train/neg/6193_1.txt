I can not believe I just spent an hour and a half watching such a weak movie. If there's only one movie you have to miss, it's one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father recently died, so he starts dating local anti-social teenagers and drugs. All this makes him subconsciously more violent and eventually explodes such a subconscious ... The first thing is that I do not think I find a meaning or a trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character. If the director considers what I have seen in the last few minutes as a great ecstasy, I have to say that this is not even close. The use of cinema is also not mature. Most of the time I could not see facial expressions from the actors and I did not feel that body language was enough to have an impact. Perhaps the crew were so tired they fixed the room there to include everything in the settings. Everyone is happy, except for the public. The terrain is particularly weak. There are a lot of scenes and discussions that should not be linked, but they are really so random that you can never shoot them together, maybe only if you are the one who wrote them. At least an hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real action and there are people who just walk, talk and move all the time. So, I really can not comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> The pleasant music selection in the last few minutes. Perhaps this is the only good thing. I never gave a 1 movie, but this movie definitely deserves (at least laughs when watching horrible movies). This is a movie about when an unsuccessful attempt to describe problem teenagers encounters an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you do not join any groups.
