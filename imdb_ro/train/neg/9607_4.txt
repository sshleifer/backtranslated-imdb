Do not listen to the misleading title "The Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well-known for focusing on sex and nudity on the real threats of their horror films, but this is just a little too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have an unpleasant sexual scene with a title character, crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun first time a few times, but a hundred minutes become very fast monotonous. Not even a werewolf, but a schizophagian whose ancestor was hung for licanty. The film can not even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a retrospect) being a horror supernatural legend (I thought I was in a classic after) in a rather poor character study, the woman being abused and repeatedly tortured to a thriller of revenge. Finally, the director insists he is based on a true story. Yes, OK. To be fair, there are some fun aspects of production. The title Werewolf Woman is a looker and there are some beautiful gore effects and nude scenes. However, they are quickly becoming monotonous. Also, the double dialogue is quite hilarious in a fashion camp, especially the swinging doctor in the world (drinking at work). Unfortunately, the movie gets pretty irritated quickly. There is no real plot or something else in reality. It's a shame, because reading a description I felt the movie had real potential. The "elderly woman" is too long, moved slowly and a little too much, even to the standards of exploitation. (4/10)
