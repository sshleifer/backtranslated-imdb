This is a poor film with a disturbing history of cuts and re-appointments. It does not work at all. First of all, dramaturgy is wrong. He moves very slowly at first and then moves in a hurry and unsatisfying to the end. But there is (and which may be related to cuts) a difficult movement between genres. It starts with being a thriller that will be taken to face value and then degenerates into a hoax rather than satire. the end may be fun, but it is so steadfast that I almost felt insulting my intelligence (which is little there). So, the movie tries to be everything, but it really does not succeed at all levels. You can also see that in the development of the very unstable character. Almost get the impression Connery plays three roles, rather than one.
